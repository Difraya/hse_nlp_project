I could\r\nat any rate enumerate at least seven hundred which have appeared in\r\nEnglish in various books entitled _\u00c6sop\u2019s Fables_. L\u2019Estrange\u2019s\r\ncollection alone contains over five hundred. In the struggle for\r\nexistence among all these a certain number stand out as being the most\r\neffective and the most familiar. I have attempted to bring most of\r\nthese into the following pages.\r\n\r\nThere is no fixed text even for the nucleus collection contained in\r\nthis book. \u00c6sop himself is so shadowy a figure that we might almost be\r\nforgiven if we held, with regard to him, the heresy of Mistress\r\nElizabeth Prig. What we call his fables can in most cases be traced\r\nback to the fables of other people, notably of Ph\u00e6drus and Babrius. It\r\nis usual to regard the Greek Prose Collections, passing under the name\r\nof \u00c6sop, as having greater claims to the eponymous title; but modern\r\nresearch has shown that these are but medieval prosings of Babrius\u2019s\r\nverse. I have therefore felt at liberty to retell the fables in such a\r\nway as would interest children, and have adopted from the various\r\nversions that which seemed most suitable in each case, telling the\r\nfable anew in my own way.\r\n\r\nMuch has been learnt during the present century about the history of\r\nthe various apologues that walk abroad under the name of \u201c\u00c6sop.\u201d I have\r\nattempted to bring these various lines of research together in the\r\nsomewhat elaborate introductory volume which I wrote to accompany my\r\nedition of Caxton\u2019s _\u00c6sop_, published by Mr. Nutt in his _Biblioth\u00e8que\r\nde Carabas_. I have placed in front of the present version of the\r\n\u201cFables,\u201d by kind permission of Mr. Nutt, the short abstract of my\r\nresearches in which I there summed up the results of that volume. I\r\nmust accompany it, here as there, by a warning to the reader, that for\r\na large proportion of the results thus reached I am myself responsible;\r\nbut I am happy to say that many of them have been accepted by the\r\nexperts in America, France, and Germany, who have done me the honour to\r\nconsider my researches. Here, in England, there does not seem to be\r\nmuch interest in this class of work, and English scholars, for the most\r\npart, are content to remain in ignorance of the methods and results of\r\nliterary history.\r\n\r\nI have attached to the \u201cFables\u201d in the obscurity of small print at the\r\nend a series of notes, summing up what is known as to the _provenance_\r\nof each fable. Here, again, I have tried to put in shorter and more\r\nreadable form the results of my researches in the volume to which I\r\nhave already referred. For more detailed information I must refer to\r\nthe forty closely-printed pages (vol. i. pp. 225-268) which contain the\r\nbibliography of the Fables.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH JACOBS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SHORT HISTORY OF THE \u00c6SOPIC FABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nMost nations develop the Beast-Tale as part of their folk-lore, some go\r\nfurther and apply it to satiric purposes, and a few nations afford\r\nisolated examples of the shaping of the Beast-Tale to teach some moral\r\ntruth by means of the Fable properly so called.[1] But only two peoples\r\nindependently made this a general practice. Both in Greece[2] and in\r\nIndia we find in the earliest literature such casual and frequent\r\nmention of Fables as seems to imply a body of Folk-Fables current among\r\nthe people. And in both countries special circumstances raised the\r\nFable from folklore into literature. In Greece, during the epoch of the\r\nTyrants, when free speech was dangerous, the Fable was largely used for\r\npolitical purposes. The inventor of this application or the most\r\nprominent user of it was one \u00c6sop, a slave at Samos whose name has ever\r\nsince been connected with the Fable. All that we know about him is\r\ncontained in a few lines of Herodotus: that he flourished 550 B.C.; was\r\nkilled in accordance with a Delphian oracle; and that _wergild_ was\r\nclaimed for him by the grandson of his master, Iadmon. When free speech\r\nwas established in the Greek democracies, the custom of using Fables in\r\nharangues was continued and encouraged by the rhetoricians, while the\r\nmirth-producing qualities of the Fable caused it to be regarded as fit\r\nsubject of after-dinner conversation along with other jests of a\r\nbroader kind (\u201cMilesian,\u201d \u201cSybaritic\u201d). This habit of regarding the\r\nFable as a form of the Jest intensified the tendency to connect it with\r\na well-known name as in the case of our Joe Miller. About 300 B.C.\r\nDemetrius Phalereus, whilom tyrant of Athens and founder of the\r\nAlexandria Library, collected together all the Fables he could find\r\nunder the title of _Assemblies of \u00c6sopic Tales_ (\u039b\u03cc\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u1f30\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd\r\n\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03b1\u03b9). This collection, running probably to some 200 Fables, after\r\nbeing interpolated and edited by the Alexandrine grammarians, was\r\nturned into neat Latin iambics by Ph\u00e6drus, a Greek freedman of Augustus\r\nin the early years of the Christian era. As the modern \u00c6sop is mainly\r\nderived from Ph\u00e6drus, the answer to the question \u201cWho wrote \u00c6sop?\u201d is\r\nsimple : \u201cDemetrius of Phaleron.\u201d[3]\r\n\r\n [1] _E.g._ Jotham\u2019s Fable, Judges ix., and that of Menenius Agrippa in\r\n Livy, seem to be quite independent of either Greek or Indian\r\n influence. But one fable does not make Fable.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] Only about twenty fables, however, are known in Greece before\r\n Ph\u00e6drus, 30 A.D. See my Caxton\u2019s _\u00c6sop_ vol. i. pp. 26\u201329, for a\r\n complete enumeration.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] For this statement and what follows a reference to the Pedigree of\r\n the Fables on p. 196 will be found useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn India the great ethical reformer, Sakyamuni, the Buddha, initiated\r\n(or adopted from the Brahmins) the habit of using the Beast-Tale for\r\nmoral purposes, or, in other words, transformed it into the Fable\r\nproper. A collection of these seems to have existed previously and\r\nindependently, in which the Fables were associated with the name of a\r\nmythical sage, Kasy\u00e2pa. These were appropriated by the early Buddhists\r\nby the simple expedient of making Kasy\u00e2pa the immediately preceding\r\nincarnation of the Buddha. A number of his _itih\u00e2sas_ or Tales were\r\nincluded in the sacred Buddhistic work containing the _J\u0101takas_ or\r\nprevious-births of the Buddha, in some of which the Bodisat (or future\r\nBuddha) appears as one of the Dramatis Person\u00e6 of the Fables; the\r\nCrane, _e.g._, in our _Wolf and Crane_ being one of the incarnations of\r\nthe Buddha. So, too, the Lamb of our _Wolf and Lamb_ was once Buddha;\r\nit was therefore easy for him\u2014so the Buddhists thought\u2014to remember and\r\ntell these Fables as incidents of his former careers. It is obvious\r\nthat the whole idea of a Fable as an anecdote about a man masquerading\r\nin the form of a beast could most easily arise and gain currency where\r\nthe theory of transmigration was vividly credited.\r\n\r\nThe Fables of Kasy\u00e2pa, or rather the moral verses (_gathas_) which\r\nserved as a _memoria technica_ to them, were probably carried over to\r\nCeylon in 241 B.C. along with the J\u0101takas. About 300 years later (say\r\n50 A.D.) some 100 of these were brought by a Cingalese embassy to\r\nAlexandria, where they were translated under the title of \u201cLibyan\r\nFables\u201d (\u039b\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03b9 \u039b\u03c5\u03b2\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af), which had been earlier applied to similar\r\nstories that had percolated to Hellas from India; they were attributed\r\nto \u201cKybises.\u201d This collection seems to have introduced the habit of\r\nsumming up the teaching of a Fable in the Moral, corresponding to the\r\n_gatha_ of the J\u0101takas. About the end of the first century A.D. the\r\nLibyan Fables of \u201cKybises\u201d became known to the Rabbinic school at\r\nJabne, founded by R. Jochanan ben Saccai, and a number of the Fables\r\ntranslated into Aramaic which are still extant in the Talmud and\r\nMidrash.\r\n\r\nIn the Roman world the two collections of Demetrius and \u201cKybises\u201d were\r\nbrought together by Nicostratus, a rhetor attached to the court of\r\nMarcus Aurelius. In the earlier part of the next century (c. 230 A.D.)\r\nthis _corpus_ of the ancient fable, \u00c6sopic and Libyan, amounting in all\r\nto some 300 members, was done into Greek verse with Latin accentuation\r\n(choliambics) by Valerius Babrius, tutor to the young son of Alexander\r\nSeverus. Still later, towards the end of the fourth century, forty-two\r\nof these, mainly of the Libyan section, were translated into Latin\r\nverse by one Avian, with whom the ancient history of the Fable ends.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages it was naturally the Latin Ph\u00e6drus that represented\r\nthe \u00c6sopic Fable to the learned world, but Ph\u00e6drus in a fuller form\r\nthan has descended to us in verse. A selection of some eighty fables\r\nwas turned into indifferent prose in the ninth century, probably at the\r\nSchools of Charles the Great. This was attributed to a fictitious\r\nRomulus. Another prose collection by Ademar of Chabannes was made\r\nbefore 1030, and still preserves some of the lines of the lost Fables\r\nof Ph\u00e6drus. The Fables became especially popular among the Normans. A\r\nnumber of them occur on the Bayeux Tapestry, and in the twelfth century\r\nEngland, the head of the Angevin empire, became the home of the Fable,\r\nall the important adaptations and versions of \u00c6sop being made in this\r\ncountry. One of these done into Latin verse by Walter the Englishman\r\nbecame the standard \u00c6sop of medieval Christendom. The same history\r\napplies in large measure to the Fables of Avian, which were done into\r\nprose, transferred back into Latin verse, and sent forth through Europe\r\nfrom England.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Babrius had been suffering the same fate as Ph\u00e6drus. His\r\nscazons were turned into poor Greek prose, and selections of them pass\r\nto this day as the original Fables of \u00c6sop. Some fifty of these were\r\nselected, and with the addition of a dozen Oriental fables, were\r\nattributed to an imaginary Persian sage, Syntipas; this collection was\r\ntranslated into Syriac, and thence into Arabic, where they passed under\r\nthe name of the legendary L\u00f4qman (probably a doublet of Balaam). A\r\nstill larger collection of the Greek prose versions got into Arabic,\r\nwhere it was enriched by some 60 fables from the Arabic Bidpai and\r\nother sources, but still passed under the name of \u00c6sop. This\r\ncollection, containing 164 fables, was brought to England after the\r\nThird Crusade of Richard I., and translated into Latin by an Englishman\r\nnamed Alfred, with the aid of an Oxford Jew named Berachyah ha-Nakdan\r\n(\u201cBenedictus le Puncteur\u201d in the English Records), who, on his own\r\naccount, translated a number of the fables into Hebrew rhymed prose,\r\nunder the Talmudic title _Mishle Shu\u2018alim_ (Fox Fables).[4] Part of\r\nAlfred\u2019s \u00c6sop was translated into English alliterative verse, and this\r\nagain was translated about 1200 into French by Marie de France, who\r\nattributed the new fables to King Alfred. After her no important\r\naddition was made to the medieval \u00c6sop.\r\n\r\n [4] I have given specimens of his Fables in my _Jews of Angevin\r\n England_, pp. 165\u2013173, 278\u2013281.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the invention of printing the European book of \u00c6sop was compiled\r\nabout 1480 by Heinrich Stainh\u00f6wel, who put together the Romulus with\r\nselections from Avian, some of the Greek prose versions of Babrius from\r\nRanuzio\u2019s translation, and a few from Alfred\u2019s \u00c6sop. To these he added\r\nthe legendary life of \u00c6sop and a selection of somewhat loose tales from\r\nPetrus Alphonsi and Poggio Bracciolini, corresponding to the Milesian\r\nand Sybaritic tales which were associated with the Fable in antiquity.\r\nStainh\u00f6wel translated all this into German, and within twenty years his\r\ncollection had been turned into French, English (by Caxton, in 1484),\r\nItalian, Dutch, and Spanish. Additions were made to it by Brandt and\r\nWaldis in Germany, by L\u2019Estrange in England, and by La Fontaine in\r\nFrance; these were chiefly from the larger Greek collections published\r\nafter Stainh\u00f6wel\u2019s day, and, in the case of La Fontaine, from Bidpai\r\nand other Oriental sources. But these additions have rarely taken hold,\r\nand the \u00c6sop of modern Europe is in large measure Stainh\u00f6wel\u2019s, even to\r\nthe present day. The first three quarters of the present collection are\r\nStainh\u00f6wel mainly in Stainh\u00f6wel\u2019s order. Selections from it passed into\r\nspelling and reading books, and made the Fables part of modern European\r\nfolk-lore.[5]\r\n\r\n [5] An episode in the history of the modern \u00c6sop deserves record, if\r\n only to illustrate the law that \u00c6sop always begins his career as a\r\n political weapon in a new home. When a selection of the Fables were\r\n translated into Chinese in 1840 they became favourite reading with the\r\n officials, till a high dignitary said, \u201cThis is clearly directed\r\n against _us_,\u201d and ordered \u00c6sop to be included in the Chinese _Index\r\n Expurgatorius_ (R. Morris, _Cont. Rev_. xxxix. p. 731).\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may conclude this history of \u00c6sop with a similar account of the\r\nprogress of \u00c6sopic investigation. First came collection; the Greek \u00c6sop\r\nwas brought together by Neveletus in 1610, the Latin by Nilant in 1709.\r\nThe main truth about the former was laid down by the master-hand of\r\nBentley during a skirmish in the Battle of the Books; the equally great\r\ncritic Lessing began to unravel the many knotty points connected with\r\nthe medieval Latin \u00c6sop. His investigations have been carried on and\r\ncompleted by three Frenchmen in the present century, Robert, Du M\u00e9ril,\r\nand Hervieux; while three Germans, Crusius, Benfey, and Mall, have\r\nthrown much needed light on Babrius, on the Oriental \u00c6sop, and on Marie\r\nde France. Lastly, I have myself brought together these various lines\r\nof inquiry, and by adding a few threads of my own, have been able to\r\nweave them all for the first time into a consistent pattern.[6]\r\n\r\n [6] _The Fables of \u00c6sop, as first printed by William Caxton in_ 1484,\r\n _now again edited and induced by Joseph Jacobs_ (London, 1889), 2\r\n vols., the first containing a History of the \u00c6sopic Fable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much for the past of the Fable. Has it a future as a mode of\r\nliterary expression? Scarcely; its method is at once too simple and too\r\nroundabout. Too roundabout; for the truths we have to tell we prefer to\r\nspeak out directly and not by way of allegory. And the truths the Fable\r\nhas to teach are too simple to correspond to the facts of our complex\r\ncivilisation; its rude _graffiti_ of human nature cannot reproduce the\r\nsubtle gradations of modern life. But as we all pass through in our\r\nlives the various stages of ancestral culture, there comes a time when\r\nthese rough sketches of life have their appeal to us as they had for\r\nour forefathers. The allegory gives us a pleasing and not too strenuous\r\nstimulation of the intellectual powers; the lesson is not too\r\ncomplicated for childlike minds. Indeed, in their grotesque grace, in\r\ntheir quaint humour, in their trust in the simpler virtues, in their\r\ninsight into the cruder vices, in their innocence of the fact of sex,\r\n\u00c6sop\u2019s Fables are as little children. They are as little children, and\r\nfor that reason they will for ever find a home in the heaven of little\r\nchildren\u2019s souls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAesop\u2019s Fables\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cock and the Pearl\r\n\r\n\r\nA cock was once strutting up and down the farmyard among the hens when\r\nsuddenly he espied something shinning amid the straw. \u201cHo! ho!\u201d quoth\r\nhe, \u201cthat\u2019s for me,\u201d and soon rooted it out from beneath the straw.\r\n\u201cWhat did it turn out to be but a Pearl that by some chance had been\r\nlost in the yard? \u201cYou may be a treasure,\u201d quoth Master Cock, \u201cto men\r\nthat prize you, but for me I would rather have a single barley-corn\r\nthan a peck of pearls.\u201d\r\n\r\nPrecious things are for those that can prize them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wolf and the Lamb\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time a Wolf was lapping at a spring on a hillside, when,\r\nlooking up, what should he see but a Lamb just beginning to drink a\r\nlittle lower down. \u201cThere\u2019s my supper,\u201d thought he, \u201cif only I can find\r\nsome excuse to seize it.\u201d Then he called out to the Lamb, \u201cHow dare you\r\nmuddle the water from which I am drinking?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, master, nay,\u201d said Lambikin; \u201cif the water be muddy up there, I\r\ncannot be the cause of it, for it runs down from you to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d said the Wolf, \u201cwhy did you call me bad names this time\r\nlast year?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat cannot be,\u201d said the Lamb; \u201cI am only six months old.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d snarled the Wolf; \u201cif it was not you it was your\r\nfather;\u201d and with that he rushed upon the poor little Lamb and\r\n\r\nWARRA WARRA WARRA WARRA WARRA\r\n\r\n\r\nate her all up. But before she died she gasped out\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cAny excuse will serve a tyrant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dog and the Shadow\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened that a Dog had got a piece of meat and was carrying it home\r\nin his mouth to eat it in peace. Now on his way home he had to cross a\r\nplank lying across a running brook. As he crossed, he looked down and\r\nsaw his own shadow reflected in the water beneath. Thinking it was\r\nanother dog with another piece of meat, he made up his mind to have\r\nthat also. So he made a snap at the shadow in the water, but as he\r\nopened his mouth the piece of meat fell out, dropped into the water and\r\nwas never seen more.\r\n\r\nBeware lest you lose the substance by grasping at the shadow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion\u2019s Share\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion went once a-hunting along with the Fox, the Jackal, and the\r\nWolf. They hunted and they hunted till at last they surprised a Stag,\r\nand soon took its life. Then came the question how the spoil should be\r\ndivided. \u201cQuarter me this Stag,\u201d roared the Lion; so the other animals\r\nskinned it and cut it into four parts. Then the Lion took his stand in\r\nfront of the carcass and pronounced judgment: The first quarter is for\r\nme in my capacity as King of Beasts; the second is mine as arbiter;\r\nanother share comes to me for my part in the chase; and as for the\r\nfourth quarter, well, as for that, I should like to see which of you\r\nwill dare to lay a paw upon it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHumph,\u201d grumbled the Fox as he walked away with his tail between his\r\nlegs; but he spoke in a low growl\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may share the labours of the great, but you will not share the\r\nspoil.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wolf and the Crane\r\n\r\n\r\nA Wolf had been gorging on an animal he had killed, when suddenly a\r\nsmall bone in the meat stuck in his throat and he could not swallow it.\r\nHe soon felt terrible pain in his throat, and ran up and down groaning\r\nand groaning and seeking for something to relieve the pain. He tried to\r\ninduce every one he met to remove the bone. \u201cI would give anything,\u201d\r\nsaid he, \u201cif you would take it out.\u201d At last the Crane agreed to try,\r\nand told the Wolf to lie on his side and open his jaws as wide as he\r\ncould. Then the Crane put its long neck down the Wolf\u2019s throat, and\r\nwith its beak loosened the bone, till at last it got it out.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you kindly give me the reward you promised?\u201d said the Crane.\r\n\r\nThe Wolf grinned and showed his teeth and said: \u201cBe content. You have\r\nput your head inside a Wolf\u2019s mouth and taken it out again in safety;\r\nthat ought to be reward enough for you.\u201d\r\n\r\nGratitude and greed go not together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man and the Serpent\r\n\r\n\r\nA Countryman\u2019s son by accident trod upon a Serpent\u2019s tail, which turned\r\nand bit him so that he died. The father in a rage got his axe, and\r\npursuing the Serpent, cut off part of its tail. So the Serpent in\r\nrevenge began stinging several of the Farmer\u2019s cattle and caused him\r\nsevere loss. Well, the Farmer thought it best to make it up with the\r\nSerpent, and brought food and honey to the mouth of its lair, and said\r\nto it: \u201cLet\u2019s forget and forgive; perhaps you were right to punish my\r\nson, and take vengeance on my cattle, but surely I was right in trying\r\nto revenge him; now that we are both satisfied why should not we be\r\nfriends again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d said the Serpent; \u201ctake away your gifts; you can never forget\r\nthe death of your son, nor I the loss of my tail.\u201d\r\n\r\nInjuries may be forgiven, but not forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Town Mouse and the Country Mouse\r\n\r\n\r\nNow you must know that a Town Mouse once upon a time went on a visit to\r\nhis cousin in the country. He was rough and ready, this cousin, but he\r\nloved his town friend and made him heartily welcome. Beans and bacon,\r\ncheese and bread, were all he had to offer, but he offered them freely.\r\nThe Town Mouse rather turned up his long nose at this country fare, and\r\nsaid: \u201cI cannot understand, Cousin, how you can put up with such poor\r\nfood as this, but of course you cannot expect anything better in the\r\ncountry; come you with me and I will show you how to live. When you\r\nhave been in town a week you will wonder how you could ever have stood\r\na country life.\u201d No sooner said than done: the two mice set off for the\r\ntown and arrived at the Town Mouse\u2019s residence late at night. \u201cYou will\r\nwant some refreshment after our long journey,\u201d said the polite Town\r\nMouse, and took his friend into the grand dining-room. There they found\r\nthe remains of a fine feast, and soon the two mice were eating up\r\njellies and cakes and all that was nice. Suddenly they heard growling\r\nand barking. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d said the Country Mouse. \u201cIt is only the\r\ndogs of the house,\u201d answered the other. \u201cOnly!\u201d said the Country Mouse.\r\n\u201cI do not like that music at my dinner.\u201d Just at that moment the door\r\nflew open, in came two huge mastiffs, and the two mice had to scamper\r\ndown and run off. \u201cGood-bye, Cousin,\u201d said the Country Mouse. \u201cWhat!\r\ngoing so soon?\u201d said the other. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied;\r\n\r\n\u201cBetter beans and bacon in peace than cakes and ale in fear.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Crow\r\n\r\n\r\nA Fox once saw a Crow fly off with a piece of cheese in its beak and\r\nsettle on a branch of a tree. \u201cThat\u2019s for me, as I am a Fox,\u201d said\r\nMaster Reynard, and he walked up to the foot of the tree. \u201cGood-day,\r\nMistress Crow,\u201d he cried. \u201cHow well you are looking to-day: how glossy\r\nyour feathers; how bright your eye. I feel sure your voice must surpass\r\nthat of other birds, just as your figure does; let me hear but one song\r\nfrom you that I may greet you as the Queen of Birds.\u201d The Crow lifted\r\nup her head and began to caw her best, but the moment she opened her\r\nmouth the piece of cheese fell to the ground, only to be snapped up by\r\nMaster Fox. \u201cThat will do,\u201d said he. \u201cThat was all I wanted. In\r\nexchange for your cheese I will give you a piece of advice for the\r\nfuture\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not trust flatterers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Flatter doth rob by stealth,\r\nHis victim, both of Wit and Wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sick Lion\r\n\r\n\r\nA Lion had come to the end of his days and lay sick unto death at the\r\nmouth of his cave, gasping for breath. The animals, his subjects, came\r\nround him and drew nearer as he grew more and more helpless. When they\r\nsaw him on the point of death they thought to themselves: \u201cNow is the\r\ntime to pay off old grudges.\u201d So the Boar came up and drove at him with\r\nhis tusks; then a Bull gored him with his horns; still the Lion lay\r\nhelpless before them: so the Ass, feeling quite safe from danger, came\r\nup, and turning his tail to the Lion kicked up his heels into his face.\r\n\u201cThis is a double death,\u201d growled the Lion.\r\n\r\nOnly cowards insult dying majesty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ass and the Lapdog\r\n\r\n\r\nA Farmer one day came to the stables to see to his beasts of burden:\r\namong them was his favourite Ass, that was always well fed and often\r\ncarried his master. With the Farmer came his Lapdog, who danced about\r\nand licked his hand and frisked about as happy as could be. The Farmer\r\nfelt in his pocket, gave the Lapdog some dainty food, and sat down\r\nwhile he gave his orders to his servants. The Lapdog jumped into his\r\nmaster\u2019s lap, and lay there blinking while the Farmer stroked his ears.\r\nThe Ass, seeing this, broke loose from his halter and commenced\r\nprancing about in imitation of the Lapdog. The Farmer could not hold\r\nhis sides with laughter, so the Ass went up to him, and putting his\r\nfeet upon the Farmer\u2019s shoulder attempted to climb into his lap. The\r\nFarmer\u2019s servants rushed up with sticks and pitchforks and soon taught\r\nthe Ass that\r\n\r\nClumsy jesting is no joke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion and the Mouse\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce when a Lion was asleep a little Mouse began running up and down\r\nupon him; this soon wakened the Lion, who placed his huge paw upon him,\r\nand opened his big jaws to swallow him. \u201cPardon, O King,\u201d cried the\r\nlittle Mouse: \u201cforgive me this time, I shall never forget it: who knows\r\nbut what I may be able to do you a turn some of these days?\u201d The Lion\r\nwas so tickled at the idea of the Mouse being able to help him, that he\r\nlifted up his paw and let him go. Some time after the Lion was caught\r\nin a trap, and the hunters who desired to carry him alive to the King,\r\ntied him to a tree while they went in search of a waggon to carry him\r\non. Just then the little Mouse happened to pass by, and seeing the sad\r\nplight in which the Lion was, went up to him and soon gnawed away the\r\nropes that bound the King of the Beasts. \u201cWas I not right?\u201d said the\r\nlittle Mouse.\r\n\r\nLittle friends may prove great friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Swallow and the Other Birds\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened that a Countryman was sowing some hemp seeds in a field\r\nwhere a Swallow and some other birds were hopping about picking up\r\ntheir food. \u201cBeware of that man,\u201d quoth the Swallow. \u201cWhy, what is he\r\ndoing?\u201d said the others. \u201cThat is hemp seed he is sowing; be careful to\r\npick up every one of the seeds, or else you will repent it.\u201d The birds\r\npaid no heed to the Swallow\u2019s words, and by and by the hemp grew up and\r\nwas made into cord, and of the cords nets were made, and many a bird\r\nthat had despised the Swallow\u2019s advice was caught in nets made out of\r\nthat very hemp. \u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d said the Swallow.\r\n\r\nDestroy the seed of evil, or it will grow up to your ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Frogs Desiring a King\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Frogs were living as happy as could be in a marshy swamp that just\r\nsuited them; they went splashing about caring for nobody and nobody\r\ntroubling with them. But some of them thought that this was not right,\r\nthat they should have a king and a proper constitution, so they\r\ndetermined to send up a petition to Jove to give them what they wanted.\r\n\u201cMighty Jove,\u201d they cried, \u201csend unto us a king that will rule over us\r\nand keep us in order.\u201d Jove laughed at their croaking, and threw down\r\ninto the swamp a huge Log, which came down splashing into the swamp.\r\nThe Frogs were frightened out of their lives by the commotion made in\r\ntheir midst, and all rushed to the bank to look at the horrible\r\nmonster; but after a time, seeing that it did not move, one or two of\r\nthe boldest of them ventured out towards the Log, and even dared to\r\ntouch it; still it did not move. Then the greatest hero of the Frogs\r\njumped upon the Log and commenced dancing up and down upon it,\r\nthereupon all the Frogs came and did the same; and for some time the\r\nFrogs went about their business every day without taking the slightest\r\nnotice of their new King Log lying in their midst. But this did not\r\nsuit them, so they sent another petition to Jove, and said to him, \u201cWe\r\nwant a real king; one that will really rule over us.\u201d Now this made\r\nJove angry, so he sent among them a big Stork that soon set to work\r\ngobbling them all up. Then the Frogs repented when too late.\r\n\r\nBetter no rule than cruel rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mountains in Labour\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day the Countrymen noticed that the Mountains were in labour; smoke\r\ncame out of their summits, the earth was quaking at their feet, trees\r\nwere crashing, and huge rocks were tumbling. They felt sure that\r\nsomething horrible was going to happen. They all gathered together in\r\none place to see what terrible thing this could be. They waited and\r\nthey waited, but nothing came. At last there was a still more violent\r\nearthquake, and a huge gap appeared in the side of the Mountains. They\r\nall fell down upon their knees and waited. At last, and at last, a\r\nteeny, tiny mouse poked its little head and bristles out of the gap and\r\ncame running down towards them, and ever after they used to say:\r\n\r\n\u201cMuch outcry, little outcome.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hares and the Frogs\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hares were so persecuted by the other beasts, they did not know\r\nwhere to go. As soon as they saw a single animal approach them, off\r\nthey used to run. One day they saw a troop of wild Horses stampeding\r\nabout, and in quite a panic all the Hares scuttled off to a lake hard\r\nby, determined to drown themselves rather than live in such a continual\r\nstate of fear. But just as they got near the bank of the lake, a troop\r\nof Frogs, frightened in their turn by the approach of the Hares\r\nscuttled off, and jumped into the water. \u201cTruly,\u201d said one of the\r\nHares, \u201cthings are not so bad as they seem:\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is always someone worse off than yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wolf and the Kid\r\n\r\n\r\nA Kid was perched up on the top of a house, and looking down saw a Wolf\r\npassing under him. Immediately he began to revile and attack his enemy.\r\n\u201cMurderer and thief,\u201d he cried, \u201cwhat do you here near honest folks\u2019\r\nhouses? How dare you make an appearance where your vile deeds are\r\nknown?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCurse away, my young friend,\u201d said the Wolf.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is easy to be brave from a safe distance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Woodman and the Serpent\r\n\r\n\r\nOne wintry day a Woodman was tramping home from his work when he saw\r\nsomething black lying on the snow. When he came closer he saw it was a\r\nSerpent to all appearance dead. But he took it up and put it in his\r\nbosom to warm while he hurried home. As soon as he got indoors he put\r\nthe Serpent down on the hearth before the fire. The children watched it\r\nand saw it slowly come to life again. Then one of them stooped down to\r\nstroke it, but the Serpent raised its head and put out its fangs and\r\nwas about to sting the child to death. So the Woodman seized his axe,\r\nand with one stroke cut the Serpent in two. \u201cAh,\u201d said he,\r\n\r\n\u201cNo gratitude from the wicked.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bald Man and the Fly\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a Bald Man who sat down after work on a hot summer\u2019s\r\nday. A Fly came up and kept buzzing about his bald pate, and stinging\r\nhim from time to time. The Man aimed a blow at his little enemy,\r\nbut\u2014_whack_\u2014his palm came on his head instead; again the Fly tormented\r\nhim, but this time the Man was wiser and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will only injure yourself if you take notice of despicable\r\nenemies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Stork\r\n\r\n\r\nAt one time the Fox and the Stork were on visiting terms and seemed\r\nvery good friends. So the Fox invited the Stork to dinner, and for a\r\njoke put nothing before her but some soup in a very shallow dish. This\r\nthe Fox could easily lap up, but the Stork could only wet the end of\r\nher long bill in it, and left the meal as hungry as when she began. \u201cI\r\nam sorry,\u201d said the Fox, \u201cthe soup is not to your liking.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray do not apologise,\u201d said the Stork. \u201cI hope you will return this\r\nvisit, and come and dine with me soon.\u201d So a day was appointed when the\r\nFox should visit the Stork; but when they were seated at table all that\r\nwas for their dinner was contained in a very long-necked jar with a\r\nnarrow mouth, in which the Fox could not insert his snout, so all he\r\ncould manage to do was to lick the outside of the jar.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will not apologise for the dinner,\u201d said the Stork:\r\n\r\n\u201cOne bad turn deserves another.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Mask\r\n\r\n\r\nA Fox had by some means got into the store-room of a theatre. Suddenly\r\nhe observed a face glaring down on him and began to be very frightened;\r\nbut looking more closely he found it was only a Mask such as actors use\r\nto put over their face. \u201cAh,\u201d said the Fox, \u201cyou look very fine; it is\r\na pity you have not got any brains.\u201d\r\n\r\nOutside show is a poor substitute for inner worth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Jay and the Peacock\r\n\r\n\r\nA Jay venturing into a yard where Peacocks used to walk, found there a\r\nnumber of feathers which had fallen from the Peacocks when they were\r\nmoulting. He tied them all to his tail and strutted down towards the\r\nPeacocks. When he came near them they soon discovered the cheat, and\r\nstriding up to him pecked at him and plucked away his borrowed plumes.\r\nSo the Jay could do no better than go back to the other Jays, who had\r\nwatched his behaviour from a distance; but they were equally annoyed\r\nwith him, and told him:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not only fine feathers that make fine birds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Frog and the Ox\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOh Father,\u201d said a little Frog to the big one sitting by the side of a\r\npool, \u201cI have seen such a terrible monster! It was as big as a\r\nmountain, with horns on its head, and a long tail, and it had hoofs\r\ndivided in two.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTush, child, tush,\u201d said the old Frog, \u201cthat was only Farmer White\u2019s\r\nOx. It isn\u2019t so big either; he may be a little bit taller than I, but I\r\ncould easily make myself quite as broad; just you see.\u201d So he blew\r\nhimself out, and blew himself out, and blew himself out. \u201cWas he as big\r\nas that?\u201d asked he.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, much bigger than that,\u201d said the young Frog.\r\n\r\nAgain the old one blew himself out, and asked the young one if the Ox\r\nwas as big as that.\r\n\r\n\u201cBigger, father, bigger,\u201d was the reply.\r\n\r\nSo the Frog took a deep breath, and blew and blew and blew, and swelled\r\nand swelled and swelled. And then he said: \u201cI\u2019m sure the Ox is not as\r\nbig as this. But at this moment he burst.\r\n\r\nSelf-conceit may lead to self-destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrocles\r\n\r\n\r\nA slave named Androcles once escaped from his master and fled to the\r\nforest. As he was wandering about there he came upon a Lion lying down\r\nmoaning and groaning. At first he turned to flee, but finding that the\r\nLion did not pursue him, he turned back and went up to him. As he came\r\nnear, the Lion put out his paw, which was all swollen and bleeding, and\r\nAndrocles found that a huge thorn had got into it, and was causing all\r\nthe pain. He pulled out the thorn and bound up the paw of the Lion, who\r\nwas soon able to rise and lick the hand of Androcles like a dog. Then\r\nthe Lion took Androcles to his cave, and every day used to bring him\r\nmeat from which to live. But shortly afterwards both Androcles and the\r\nLion were captured, and the slave was sentenced to be thrown to the\r\nLion, after the latter had been kept without food for several days. The\r\nEmperor and all his Court came to see the spectacle, and Androcles was\r\nled out into the middle of the arena. Soon the Lion was let loose from\r\nhis den, and rushed bounding and roaring towards his victim. But as\r\nsoon as he came near to Androcles he recognised his friend, and fawned\r\nupon him, and licked his hands like a friendly dog. The Emperor,\r\nsurprised at this, summoned Androcles to him, who told him the whole\r\nstory. Whereupon the slave was pardoned and freed, and the Lion let\r\nloose to his native forest.\r\n\r\nGratitude is the sign of noble souls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bat, the Birds, and the Beasts\r\n\r\n\r\nA great conflict was about to come off between the Birds and the\r\nBeasts. When the two armies were collected together the Bat hesitated\r\nwhich to join. The Birds that passed his perch said: \u201cCome with us\u201d;\r\nbut he said: \u201cI am a Beast.\u201d Later on, some Beasts who were passing\r\nunderneath him looked up and said: \u201cCome with us\u201d; but he said: \u201cI am a\r\nBird.\u201d Luckily at the last moment peace was made, and no battle took\r\nplace, so the Bat came to the Birds and wished to join in the\r\nrejoicings, but they all turned against him and he had to fly away. He\r\nthen went to the Beasts, but soon had to beat a retreat, or else they\r\nwould have torn him to pieces. \u201cAh,\u201d said the Bat, \u201cI see now,\r\n\r\n\u201cHe that is neither one thing nor the other has no friends.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hart and the Hunter\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hart was once drinking from a pool and admiring the noble figure he\r\nmade there. \u201cAh,\u201d said he, \u201cwhere can you see such noble horns as\r\nthese, with such antlers! I wish I had legs more worthy to bear such a\r\nnoble crown; it is a pity they are so slim and slight.\u201d At that moment\r\na Hunter approached and sent an arrow whistling after him. Away bounded\r\nthe Hart, and soon, by the aid of his nimble legs, was nearly out of\r\nsight of the Hunter; but not noticing where he was going, he passed\r\nunder some trees with branches growing low down in which his antlers\r\nwere caught, so that the Hunter had time to come up. \u201cAlas! alas!\u201d\r\ncried the Hart:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe often despise what is most useful to us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Serpent and the File\r\n\r\n\r\nA Serpent in the course of its wanderings came into an armourer\u2019s shop.\r\nAs he glided over the floor he felt his skin pricked by a file lying\r\nthere. In a rage he turned round upon it and tried to dart his fangs\r\ninto it; but he could do no harm to heavy iron and had soon to give\r\nover his wrath.\r\n\r\nIt is useless attacking the insensible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man and the Wood\r\n\r\n\r\nA Man came into a Wood one day with an axe in his hand, and begged all\r\nthe Trees to give him a small branch which he wanted for a particular\r\npurpose. The Trees were good-natured and gave him one of their\r\nbranches. What did the Man do but fix it into the axe head, and soon\r\nset to work cutting down tree after tree. Then the Trees saw how\r\nfoolish they had been in giving their enemy the means of destroying\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dog and the Wolf\r\n\r\n\r\nA gaunt Wolf was almost dead with hunger when he happened to meet a\r\nHouse-dog who was passing by. \u201cAh, Cousin,\u201d said the Dog. \u201cI knew how\r\nit would be; your irregular life will soon be the ruin of you. Why do\r\nyou not work steadily as I do, and get your food regularly given to\r\nyou?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would have no objection,\u201d said the Wolf, \u201cif I could only get a\r\nplace.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will easily arrange that for you,\u201d said the Dog; \u201ccome with me to my\r\nmaster and you shall share my work.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the Wolf and the Dog went towards the town together. On the way\r\nthere the Wolf noticed that the hair on a certain part of the Dog\u2019s\r\nneck was very much worn away, so he asked him how that had come about.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it is nothing,\u201d said the Dog. \u201cThat is only the place where the\r\ncollar is put on at night to keep me chained up; it chafes a bit, but\r\none soon gets used to it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d said the Wolf. \u201cThen good-bye to you, Master Dog.\u201d\r\n\r\nBetter starve free than be a fat slave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Belly and the Members\r\n\r\n\r\nOne fine day it occurred to the Members of the Body that they were\r\ndoing all the work and the Belly was having all the food. So they held\r\na meeting, and after a long discussion, decided to strike work till the\r\nBelly consented to take its proper share of the work. So for a day or\r\ntwo, the Hands refused to take the food, the Mouth refused to receive\r\nit, and the Teeth had no work to do. But after a day or two the Members\r\nbegan to find that they themselves were not in a very active condition:\r\nthe Hands could hardly move, and the Mouth was all parched and dry,\r\nwhile the Legs were unable to support the rest. So thus they found that\r\neven the Belly in its dull quiet way was doing necessary work for the\r\nBody, and that all must work together or the Body will go to pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hart in the Ox-Stall\r\n\r\n\r\nA Hart hotly pursued by the hounds fled for refuge into an ox-stall,\r\nand buried itself in a truss of hay, leaving nothing to be seen but the\r\ntips of his horns. Soon after the Hunters came up and asked if any one\r\nhad seen the Hart. The stable boys, who had been resting after their\r\ndinner, looked round, but could see nothing, and the Hunters went away.\r\nShortly afterwards the master came in, and looking round, saw that\r\nsomething unusual had taken place. He pointed to the truss of hay and\r\nsaid: \u201cWhat are those two curious things sticking out of the hay?\u201d And\r\nwhen the stable boys came to look they discovered the Hart, and soon\r\nmade an end of him. He thus learnt that\r\n\r\nNothing escapes the master\u2019s eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Grapes\r\n\r\n\r\nOne hot summer\u2019s day a Fox was strolling through an orchard till he\r\ncame to a bunch of Grapes just ripening on a vine which had been\r\ntrained over a lofty branch. \u201cJust the thing to quench my thirst,\u201d\r\nquoth he. Drawing back a few paces, he took a run and a jump, and just\r\nmissed the bunch. Turning round again with a One, Two, Three, he jumped\r\nup, but with no greater success. Again and again he tried after the\r\ntempting morsel, but at last had to give it up, and walked away with\r\nhis nose in the air, saying: \u201cI am sure they are sour.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is easy to despise what you cannot get.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Peacock and Juno\r\n\r\n\r\nA Peacock once placed a petition before Juno desiring to have the voice\r\nof a nightingale in addition to his other attractions; but Juno refused\r\nhis request. When he persisted, and pointed out that he was her\r\nfavourite bird, she said:\r\n\r\n\u201cBe content with your lot; one cannot be first in everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Horse, Hunter, and Stag\r\n\r\n\r\nA quarrel had arisen between the Horse and the Stag, so the Horse came\r\nto a Hunter to ask his help to take revenge on the Stag. The Hunter\r\nagreed, but said: \u201cIf you desire to conquer the Stag, you must permit\r\nme to place this piece of iron between your jaws, so that I may guide\r\nyou with these reins, and allow this saddle to be placed upon your back\r\nso that I may keep steady upon you as we follow after the enemy.\u201d The\r\nHorse agreed to the conditions, and the Hunter soon saddled and bridled\r\nhim. Then with the aid of the Hunter the Horse soon overcame the Stag,\r\nand said to the Hunter: \u201cNow, get off, and remove those things from my\r\nmouth and back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot so fast, friend,\u201d said the Hunter. \u201cI have now got you under bit\r\nand spur, and prefer to keep you as you are at present.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf you allow men to use you for your own purposes, they will use you\r\nfor theirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Lion\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen first the Fox saw the Lion he was terribly frightened, and ran\r\naway and hid himself in the wood. Next time however he came near the\r\nKing of Beasts he stopped at a safe distance and watched him pass by.\r\nThe third time they came near one another the Fox went straight up to\r\nthe Lion and passed the time of day with him, asking him how his family\r\nwere, and when he should have the pleasure of seeing him again; then\r\nturning his tail, he parted from the Lion without much ceremony.\r\n\r\nFamiliarity breeds contempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion and the Statue\r\n\r\n\r\nA Man and a Lion were discussing the relative strength of men and lions\r\nin general. The Man contended that he and his fellows were stronger\r\nthan lions by reason of their greater intelligence. \u201cCome now with me,\u201d\r\nhe cried, \u201cand I will soon prove that I am right.\u201d So he took him into\r\nthe public gardens and showed him a statue of Hercules overcoming the\r\nLion and tearing his mouth in two.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is all very well,\u201d said the Lion, \u201cbut proves nothing, for it was\r\na man who made the statue.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe can easily represent things as we wish them to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ant and the Grasshopper\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a field one summer\u2019s day a Grasshopper was hopping about, chirping\r\nand singing to its heart\u2019s content. An Ant passed by, bearing along\r\nwith great toil an ear of corn he was taking to the nest.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not come and chat with me,\u201d said the Grasshopper, \u201cinstead of\r\ntoiling and moiling in that way?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am helping to lay up food for the winter,\u201d said the Ant, \u201cand\r\nrecommend you to do the same.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy bother about winter?\u201d said the Grasshopper; we have got plenty of\r\nfood at present.\u201d But the Ant went on its way and continued its toil.\r\nWhen the winter came the Grasshopper had no food and found itself dying\r\nof hunger, while it saw the ants distributing every day corn and grain\r\nfrom the stores they had collected in the summer. Then the Grasshopper\r\nknew:\r\n\r\nIt is best to prepare for the days of necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tree and the Reed\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, little one,\u201d said a Tree to a Reed that was growing at its foot,\r\n\u201cwhy do you not plant your feet deeply in the ground, and raise your\r\nhead boldly in the air as I do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am contented with my lot,\u201d said the Reed. \u201cI may not be so grand,\r\nbut I think I am safer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSafe!\u201d sneered the Tree. \u201cWho shall pluck me up by the roots or bow my\r\nhead to the ground?\u201d But it soon had to repent of its boasting, for a\r\nhurricane arose which tore it up from its roots, and cast it a useless\r\nlog on the ground, while the little Reed, bending to the force of the\r\nwind, soon stood upright again when the storm had passed over.\r\n\r\nObscurity often brings safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Cat\r\n\r\n\r\nA Fox was boasting to a Cat of its clever devices for escaping its\r\nenemies. \u201cI have a whole bag of tricks,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich contains a\r\nhundred ways of escaping my enemies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have only one,\u201d said the Cat; \u201cbut I can generally manage with\r\nthat.\u201d Just at that moment they heard the cry of a pack of hounds\r\ncoming towards them, and the Cat immediately scampered up a tree and\r\nhid herself in the boughs. \u201cThis is my plan,\u201d said the Cat. \u201cWhat are\r\nyou going to do?\u201d The Fox thought first of one way, then of another,\r\nand while he was debating the hounds came nearer and nearer, and at\r\nlast the Fox in his confusion was caught up by the hounds and soon\r\nkilled by the huntsmen. Miss Puss, who had been looking on, said:\r\n\r\n\u201cBetter one safe way than a hundred on which you cannot reckon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wolf in Sheep\u2019s Clothing\r\n\r\n\r\nA Wolf found great difficulty in getting at the sheep owing to the\r\nvigilance of the shepherd and his dogs. But one day it found the skin\r\nof a sheep that had been flayed and thrown aside, so it put it on over\r\nits own pelt and strolled down among the sheep. The Lamb that belonged\r\nto the sheep, whose skin the Wolf was wearing, began to follow the Wolf\r\nin the Sheep\u2019s clothing; so, leading the Lamb a little apart, he soon\r\nmade a meal off her, and for some time he succeeded in deceiving the\r\nsheep, and enjoying hearty meals.\r\n\r\nAppearances are deceptive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dog in the Manger\r\n\r\n\r\nA Dog looking out for its afternoon nap jumped into the Manger of an Ox\r\nand lay there cosily upon the straw. But soon the Ox, returning from\r\nits afternoon work, came up to the Manger and wanted to eat some of the\r\nstraw. The Dog in a rage, being awakened from its slumber, stood up and\r\nbarked at the Ox, and whenever it came near attempted to bite it. At\r\nlast the Ox had to give up the hope of getting at the straw, and went\r\naway muttering:\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, people often grudge others what they cannot enjoy themselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man and the Wooden God\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the old days men used to worship sticks and stones and idols, and\r\nprayed to them to give them luck. It happened that a Man had often\r\nprayed to a wooden idol he had received from his father, but his luck\r\nnever seemed to change. He prayed and he prayed, but still he remained\r\nas unlucky as ever. One day in the greatest rage he went to the Wooden\r\nGod, and with one blow swept it down from its pedestal. The idol broke\r\nin two, and what did he see? An immense number of coins flying all over\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fisher\r\n\r\n\r\nA Fisher once took his bagpipes to the bank of a river, and played upon\r\nthem with the hope of making the fish rise; but never a one put his\r\nnose out of the water. So he cast his net into the river and soon drew\r\nit forth filled with fish. Then he took his bagpipes again, and, as he\r\nplayed, the fish leapt up in the net. \u201cAh, you dance now when I play,\u201d\r\nsaid he.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said an old Fish:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you are in a man\u2019s power you must do as he bids you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Shepherd\u2019s Boy\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a young Shepherd Boy who tended his sheep at the foot of\r\na mountain near a dark forest. It was rather lonely for him all day, so\r\nhe thought upon a plan by which he could get a little company and some\r\nexcitement. He rushed down towards the village calling out \u201cWolf,\r\nWolf,\u201d and the villagers came out to meet him, and some of them stopped\r\nwith him for a considerable time. This pleased the boy so much that a\r\nfew days afterwards he tried the same trick, and again the villagers\r\ncame to his help. But shortly after this a Wolf actually did come out\r\nfrom the forest, and began to worry the sheep, and the boy of course\r\ncried out \u201cWolf, Wolf,\u201d still louder than before. But this time the\r\nvillagers, who had been fooled twice before, thought the boy was again\r\ndeceiving them, and nobody stirred to come to his help. So the Wolf\r\nmade a good meal off the boy\u2019s flock, and when the boy complained, the\r\nwise man of the village said:\r\n\r\n\u201cA liar will not be believed, even when he speaks the truth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Young Thief and His Mother\r\n\r\n\r\nA young Man had been caught in a daring act of theft and had been\r\ncondemned to be executed for it. He expressed his desire to see his\r\nMother, and to speak with her before he was led to execution, and of\r\ncourse this was granted. When his Mother came to him he said: \u201cI want\r\nto whisper to you,\u201d and when she brought her ear near him, he nearly\r\nbit it off. All the bystanders were horrified, and asked him what he\r\ncould mean by such brutal and inhuman conduct. \u201cIt is to punish her,\u201d\r\nhe said. \u201cWhen I was young I began with stealing little things, and\r\nbrought them home to Mother. Instead of rebuking and punishing me, she\r\nlaughed and said: \u201cIt will not be noticed.\u201d It is because of her that I\r\nam here to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is right, woman,\u201d said the Priest; \u201cthe Lord hath said:\r\n\r\n\u201cTrain up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old he will\r\nnot depart therefrom.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man and His Two Wives\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the old days, when men were allowed to have many wives, a\r\nmiddle-aged Man had one wife that was old and one that was young; each\r\nloved him very much, and desired to see him like herself. Now the Man\u2019s\r\nhair was turning grey, which the young Wife did not like, as it made\r\nhim look too old for her husband. So every night she used to comb his\r\nhair and pick out the white ones. But the elder Wife saw her husband\r\ngrowing grey with great pleasure, for she did not like to be mistaken\r\nfor his mother. So every morning she used to arrange his hair and pick\r\nout as many of the black ones as she could. The consequence was the Man\r\nsoon found himself entirely bald.\r\n\r\nYield to all and you will soon have nothing to yield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nurse and the Wolf\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cBe quiet now,\u201d said an old Nurse to a child sitting on her lap. \u201cIf\r\nyou make that noise again I will throw you to the Wolf.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow it chanced that a Wolf was passing close under the window as this\r\nwas said. So he crouched down by the side of the house and waited. \u201cI\r\nam in good luck to-day,\u201d thought he. \u201cIt is sure to cry soon, and a\r\ndaintier morsel I haven\u2019t had for many a long day.\u201d So he waited, and\r\nhe waited, and he waited, till at last the child began to cry, and the\r\nWolf came forward before the window, and looked up to the Nurse,\r\nwagging his tail. But all the Nurse did was to shut down the window and\r\ncall for help, and the dogs of the house came rushing out. \u201cAh,\u201d said\r\nthe Wolf as he galloped away,\r\n\r\n\u201cEnemies\u2019 promises were made to be broken.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tortoise and the Birds\r\n\r\n\r\nA Tortoise desired to change its place of residence, so he asked an\r\nEagle to carry him to his new home, promising her a rich reward for her\r\ntrouble. The Eagle agreed and seizing the Tortoise by the shell with\r\nher talons soared aloft. On their way they met a Crow, who said to the\r\nEagle: \u201cTortoise is good eating.\u201d \u201cThe shell is too hard,\u201d said the\r\nEagle in reply. \u201cThe rocks will soon crack the shell,\u201d was the Crow\u2019s\r\nanswer; and the Eagle, taking the hint, let fall the Tortoise on a\r\nsharp rock, and the two birds made a hearty meal of the Tortoise.\r\n\r\nNever soar aloft on an enemy\u2019s pinions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Two Crabs\r\n\r\n\r\nOne fine day two Crabs came out from their home to take a stroll on the\r\nsand. \u201cChild,\u201d said the mother, \u201cyou are walking very ungracefully. You\r\nshould accustom yourself, to walking straight forward without twisting\r\nfrom side to side.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray, mother,\u201d said the young one, \u201cdo but set the example yourself,\r\nand I will follow you.\u201d\r\n\r\nExample is the best precept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ass in the Lion\u2019s Skin\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Ass once found a Lion\u2019s skin which the hunters had left out in the\r\nsun to dry. He put it on and went towards his native village. All fled\r\nat his approach, both men and animals, and he was a proud Ass that day.\r\nIn his delight he lifted up his voice and brayed, but then every one\r\nknew him, and his owner came up and gave him a sound cudgelling for the\r\nfright he had caused. And shortly afterwards a Fox came up to him and\r\nsaid: \u201cAh, I knew you by your voice.\u201d\r\n\r\nFine clothes may disguise, but silly words will disclose a fool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Two Fellows and the Bear\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Fellows were travelling together through a wood, when a Bear rushed\r\nout upon them. One of the travellers happened to be in front, and he\r\nseized hold of the branch of a tree, and hid himself among the leaves.\r\nThe other, seeing no help for it, threw himself flat down upon the\r\nground, with his face in the dust. The Bear, coming up to him, put his\r\nmuzzle close to his ear, and sniffed and sniffed. But at last with a\r\ngrowl he shook his head and slouched off, for bears will not touch dead\r\nmeat. Then the fellow in the tree came down to his comrade, and,\r\nlaughing, said \u201cWhat was it that Master Bruin whispered to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe told me,\u201d said the other,\r\n\r\n\u201cNever trust a friend who deserts you at a pinch.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Two Pots\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Pots had been left on the bank of a river, one of brass, and one of\r\nearthenware. When the tide rose they both floated off down the stream.\r\nNow the earthenware pot tried its best to keep aloof from the brass\r\none, which cried out: \u201cFear nothing, friend, I will not strike you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I may come in contact with you,\u201d said the other, \u201cif I come too\r\nclose; and whether I hit you, or you hit me, I shall suffer for it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe strong and the weak cannot keep company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Four Oxen and the Lion\r\n\r\n\r\nA Lion used to prowl about a field in which Four Oxen used to dwell.\r\nMany a time he tried to attack them; but whenever he came near they\r\nturned their tails to one another, so that whichever way he approached\r\nthem he was met by the horns of one of them. At last, however, they\r\nfell a-quarrelling among themselves, and each went off to pasture alone\r\nin a separate corner of the field. Then the Lion attacked them one by\r\none and soon made an end of all four.\r\n\r\nUnited we stand, divided we fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fisher and the Little Fish\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened that a Fisher, after fishing all day, caught only a little\r\nfish. \u201cPray, let me go, master,\u201d said the Fish. \u201cI am much too small\r\nfor your eating just now. If you put me back into the river I shall\r\nsoon grow, then you can make a fine meal off me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, nay, my little Fish,\u201d said the Fisher, \u201cI have you now. I may not\r\ncatch you hereafter.\u201d\r\n\r\nA little thing in hand is worth more than a great thing in prospect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAvaricious and Envious\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo neighbours came before Jupiter and prayed him to grant their\r\nhearts\u2019 desire. Now the one was full of avarice, and the other eaten up\r\nwith envy. So to punish them both, Jupiter granted that each might have\r\nwhatever he wished for himself, but only on condition that his\r\nneighbour had twice as much. The Avaricious man prayed to have a room\r\nfull of gold. No sooner said than done; but all his joy was turned to\r\ngrief when he found that his neighbour had two rooms full of the\r\nprecious metal. Then came the turn of the Envious man, who could not\r\nbear to think that his neighbour had any joy at all. So he prayed that\r\nhe might have one of his own eyes put out, by which means his companion\r\nwould become totally blind.\r\n\r\nVices are their own punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crow and the Pitcher\r\n\r\n\r\nA Crow, half-dead with thirst, came upon a Pitcher which had once been\r\nfull of water; but when the Crow put its beak into the mouth of the\r\nPitcher he found that only very little water was left in it, and that\r\nhe could not reach far enough down to get at it. He tried, and he\r\ntried, but at last had to give up in despair. Then a thought came to\r\nhim, and he took a pebble and dropped it into the Pitcher. Then he took\r\nanother pebble and dropped it into the Pitcher. Then he took another\r\npebble and dropped that into the Pitcher. Then he took another pebble\r\nand dropped that into the Pitcher. Then he took another pebble and\r\ndropped that into the Pitcher. Then he took another pebble and dropped\r\nthat into the Pitcher. At last, at last, he saw the water mount up near\r\nhim, and after casting in a few more pebbles he was able to quench his\r\nthirst and save his life.\r\n\r\nLittle by little does the trick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man and the Satyr\r\n\r\n\r\nA Man had lost his way in a wood one bitter winter\u2019s night. As he was\r\nroaming about, a Satyr came up to him, and finding that he had lost his\r\nway, promised to give him a lodging for the night, and guide him out of\r\nthe forest in the morning. As he went along to the Satyr\u2019s cell, the\r\nMan raised both his hands to his mouth and kept on blowing at them.\r\n\u201cWhat do you do that for?\u201d said the Satyr.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy hands are numb with the cold,\u201d said the Man, \u201cand my breath warms\r\nthem.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter this they arrived at the Satyr\u2019s home, and soon the Satyr put a\r\nsmoking dish of porridge before him. But when the Man raised his spoon\r\nto his mouth he began blowing upon it. \u201cAnd what do you do that for?\u201d\r\nsaid the Satyr.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe porridge is too hot, and my breath will cool it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOut you go,\u201d said the Satyr. \u201cI will have nought to do with a man who\r\ncan blow hot and cold with the same breath.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Goose With the Golden Eggs\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day a countryman going to the nest of his Goose found there an egg\r\nall yellow and glittering. When he took it up it was as heavy as lead\r\nand he was going to throw it away, because he thought a trick had been\r\nplayed upon him. But he took it home on second thoughts, and soon found\r\nto his delight that it was an egg of pure gold. Every morning the same\r\nthing occurred, and he soon became rich by selling his eggs. As he grew\r\nrich he grew greedy; and thinking to get at once all the gold the Goose\r\ncould give, he killed it and opened it only to find nothing.\r\n\r\nGreed oft o\u2019er reaches itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Labourer and the Nightingale\r\n\r\n\r\nA Labourer lay listening to a Nightingale\u2019s song throughout the summer\r\nnight. So pleased was he with it that the next night he set a trap for\r\nit and captured it. \u201cNow that I have caught thee,\u201d he cried, \u201cthou\r\nshalt always sing to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe Nightingales never sing in a cage.\u201d said the bird.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll eat thee.\u201d said the Labourer. \u201cI have always heard say that\r\na nightingale on toast is dainty morsel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, kill me not,\u201d said the Nightingale; \u201cbut let me free, and I\u2019ll\r\ntell thee three things far better worth than my poor body.\u201d The\r\nLabourer let him loose, and he flew up to a branch of a tree and said:\r\n\u201cNever believe a captive\u2019s promise; that\u2019s one thing. Then again: Keep\r\nwhat you have. And third piece of advice is: Sorrow not over what is\r\nlost forever.\u201d Then the song-bird flew away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox, the Cock, and the Dog\r\n\r\n\r\nOne moonlight night a Fox was prowling about a farmer\u2019s hen-coop, and\r\nsaw a Cock roosting high up beyond his reach. \u201cGood news, good news!\u201d\r\nhe cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what is that?\u201d said the Cock.\r\n\r\n\u201cKing Lion has declared a universal truce. No beast may hurt a bird\r\nhenceforth, but all shall dwell together in brotherly friendship.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, that is good news,\u201d said the Cock; \u201cand there I see some one\r\ncoming, with whom we can share the good tidings.\u201d And so saying he\r\ncraned his neck forward and looked afar off.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it you see?\u201d said the Fox.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is only my master\u2019s Dog that is coming towards us. What, going so\r\nsoon?\u201d he continued, as the Fox began to turn away as soon as he had\r\nheard the news. \u201cWill you not stop and congratulate the Dog on the\r\nreign of universal peace?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would gladly do so,\u201d said the Fox, \u201cbut I fear he may not have heard\r\nof King Lion\u2019s decree.\u201d\r\n\r\nCunning often outwits itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wind and the Sun\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger. Suddenly\r\nthey saw a traveller coming down the road, and the Sun said: \u201cI see a\r\nway to decide our dispute. Whichever of us can cause that traveller to\r\ntake off his cloak shall be regarded as the stronger. You begin.\u201d So\r\nthe Sun retired behind a cloud, and the Wind began to blow as hard as\r\nit could upon the traveller. But the harder he blew the more closely\r\ndid the traveller wrap his cloak round him, till at last the Wind had\r\nto give up in despair. Then the Sun came out and shone in all his glory\r\nupon the traveller, who soon found it too hot to walk with his cloak\r\non.\r\n\r\nKindness effects more than severity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHercules and the Waggoner\r\n\r\n\r\nA Waggoner was once driving a heavy load along a very muddy way. At\r\nlast he came to a part of the road where the wheels sank half-way into\r\nthe mire, and the more the horses pulled, the deeper sank the wheels.\r\nSo the Waggoner threw down his whip, and knelt down and prayed to\r\nHercules the Strong. \u201cO Hercules, help me in this my hour of distress,\u201d\r\nquoth he. But Hercules appeared to him, and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cTut, man, don\u2019t sprawl there. Get up and put your shoulder to the\r\nwheel.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe gods help them that help themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Miser and His Gold\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was a Miser who used to hide his gold at the\r\nfoot of a tree in his garden; but every week he used to go and dig it\r\nup and gloat over his gains. A robber, who had noticed this, went and\r\ndug up the gold and decamped with it. When the Miser next came to gloat\r\nover his treasures, he found nothing but the empty hole. He tore his\r\nhair, and raised such an outcry that all the neighbours came around\r\nhim, and he told them how he used to come and visit his gold. \u201cDid you\r\never take any of it out?\u201d asked one of them.\r\n\r\n\u201cNay,\u201d said he, \u201cI only came to look at it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen come again and look at the hole,\u201d said a neighbour; \u201cit will do\r\nyou just as much good.\u201d\r\n\r\nWealth unused might as well not exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man, the Boy, and the Donkey\r\n\r\n\r\nA Man and his son were once going with their Donkey to market. As they\r\nwere walking along by its side a countryman passed them and said: \u201cYou\r\nfools, what is a Donkey for but to ride upon?\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the Man put the Boy on the Donkey and they went on their way. But\r\nsoon they passed a group of men, one of whom said: \u201cSee that lazy\r\nyoungster, he lets his father walk while he rides.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo the Man ordered his Boy to get off, and got on himself. But they\r\nhadn\u2019t gone far when they passed two women, one of whom said to the\r\nother: \u201cShame on that lazy lout to let his poor little son trudge\r\nalong.\u201d\r\n\r\nWell, the Man didn\u2019t know what to do, but at last he took his Boy up\r\nbefore him on the Donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and\r\nthe passers-by began to jeer and point at them. The Man stopped and\r\nasked what they were scoffing at. The men said: \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of\r\nyourself for overloading that poor donkey of yours and your hulking\r\nson?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Man and Boy got off and tried to think what to do. They thought and\r\nthey thought, till at last they cut down a pole, tied the donkey\u2019s feet\r\nto it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders. They went\r\nalong amid the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market\r\nBridge, when the Donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and\r\ncaused the Boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle the Donkey\r\nfell over the bridge, and his fore-feet being tied together he was\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat will teach you,\u201d said an old man who had followed them:\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease all, and you will please none.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Mosquitoes\r\n\r\n\r\nA Fox after crossing a river got its tail entangled in a bush, and\r\ncould not move. A number of Mosquitoes seeing its plight settled upon\r\nit and enjoyed a good meal undisturbed by its tail. A hedgehog\r\nstrolling by took pity upon the Fox and went up to him: \u201cYou are in a\r\nbad way, neighbour,\u201d said the hedgehog; \u201cshall I relieve you by driving\r\noff those Mosquitoes who are sucking your blood?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Master Hedgehog,\u201d said the Fox, \u201cbut I would rather not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, how is that?\u201d asked the hedgehog.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you see,\u201d was the answer, \u201cthese Mosquitoes have had their fill;\r\nif you drive these away, others will come with fresh appetite and bleed\r\nme to death.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox Without a Tail\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened that a Fox caught its tail in a trap, and in struggling to\r\nrelease himself lost all of it but the stump. At first he was ashamed\r\nto show himself among his fellow foxes. But at last he determined to\r\nput a bolder face upon his misfortune, and summoned all the foxes to a\r\ngeneral meeting to consider a proposal which he had to place before\r\nthem. When they had assembled together the Fox proposed that they\r\nshould all do away with their tails. He pointed out how inconvenient a\r\ntail was when they were pursued by their enemies, the dogs; how much it\r\nwas in the way when they desired to sit down and hold a friendly\r\nconversation with one another. He failed to see any advantage in\r\ncarrying about such a useless encumbrance. \u201cThat is all very well,\u201d\r\nsaid one of the older foxes; \u201cbut I do not think you would have\r\nrecommended us to dispense with our chief ornament if you had not\r\nhappened to lose it yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nDistrust interested advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe One-Eyed Doe\r\n\r\n\r\nA Doe had had the misfortune to lose one of her eyes, and could not see\r\nany one approaching her on that side. So to avoid any danger she always\r\nused to feed on a high cliff near the sea, with her sound eye looking\r\ntowards the land. By this means she could see whenever the hunters\r\napproached her on land, and often escaped by this means. But the\r\nhunters found out that she was blind of one eye, and hiring a boat\r\nrowed under the cliff where she used to feed and shot her from the sea.\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d cried she with her dying voice,\r\n\r\n\u201cYou cannot escape your fate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBelling the Cat\r\n\r\n\r\nLong ago, the mice had a general council to consider what measures they\r\ncould take to outwit their common enemy, the Cat. Some said this, and\r\nsome said that; but at last a young mouse got up and said he had a\r\nproposal to make, which he thought would meet the case. \u201cYou will all\r\nagree,\u201d said he, \u201cthat our chief danger consists in the sly and\r\ntreacherous manner in which the enemy approaches us. Now, if we could\r\nreceive some signal of her approach, we could easily escape from her. I\r\nventure, therefore, to propose that a small bell be procured, and\r\nattached by a ribbon round the neck of the Cat. By this means we should\r\nalways know when she was about, and could easily retire while she was\r\nin the neighbourhood.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis proposal met with general applause, until an old mouse got up and\r\nsaid: \u201cThat is all very well, but who is to bell the Cat?\u201d The mice\r\nlooked at one another and nobody spoke. Then the old mouse said:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is easy to propose impossible remedies.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hare and the Tortoise\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hare was once boasting of his speed before the other animals. \u201cI\r\nhave never yet been beaten,\u201d said he, \u201cwhen I put forth my full speed.\r\nI challenge any one here to race with me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Tortoise said quietly, \u201cI accept your challenge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a good joke,\u201d said the Hare; \u201cI could dance round you all the\r\nway.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cKeep your boasting till you\u2019ve beaten,\u201d answered the Tortoise. \u201cShall\r\nwe race?\u201d\r\n\r\nSo a course was fixed and a start was made. The Hare darted almost out\r\nof sight at once, but soon stopped and, to show his contempt for the\r\nTortoise, lay down to have a nap. The Tortoise plodded on and plodded\r\non, and when the Hare awoke from his nap, he saw the Tortoise just near\r\nthe winning-post and could not run up in time to save the race. Then\r\nsaid the Tortoise:\r\n\r\n\u201cPlodding wins the race.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Old Man and Death\r\n\r\n\r\nAn old labourer, bent double with age and toil, was gathering sticks in\r\na forest. At last he grew so tired and hopeless that he threw down the\r\nbundle of sticks, and cried out: \u201cI cannot bear this life any longer.\r\nAh, I wish Death would only come and take me!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Death, a grisly skeleton, appeared and said to him: \u201cWhat\r\nwouldst thou, Mortal? I heard thee call me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease, sir,\u201d replied the woodcutter, \u201cwould you kindly help me to\r\nlift this faggot of sticks on to my shoulder?\u201d\r\n\r\nWe would often be sorry if our wishes were gratified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hare With Many Friends\r\n\r\n\r\nA Hare was very popular with the other beasts who all claimed to be her\r\nfriends. But one day she heard the hounds approaching and hoped to\r\nescape them by the aid of her many Friends. So, she went to the horse,\r\nand asked him to carry her away from the hounds on his back. But he\r\ndeclined, stating that he had important work to do for his master. \u201cHe\r\nfelt sure,\u201d he said, \u201cthat all her other friends would come to her\r\nassistance.\u201d She then applied to the bull, and hoped that he would\r\nrepel the hounds with his horns. The bull replied: \u201cI am very sorry,\r\nbut I have an appointment with a lady; but I feel sure that our friend\r\nthe goat will do what you want.\u201d The goat, however, feared that his\r\nback might do her some harm if he took her upon it. The ram, he felt\r\nsure, was the proper friend to apply to. So she went to the ram and\r\ntold him the case. The ram replied: \u201cAnother time, my dear friend. I do\r\nnot like to interfere on the present occasion, as hounds have been\r\nknown to eat sheep as well as hares.\u201d The Hare then applied, as a last\r\nhope, to the calf, who regretted that he was unable to help her, as he\r\ndid not like to take the responsibility upon himself, as so many older\r\npersons than himself had declined the task. By this time the hounds\r\nwere quite near, and the Hare took to her heels and luckily escaped.\r\n\r\nHe that has many friends, has no friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion in Love\r\n\r\n\r\nA Lion once fell in love with a beautiful maiden and proposed marriage\r\nto her parents. The old people did not know what to say. They did not\r\nlike to give their daughter to the Lion, yet they did not wish to\r\nenrage the King of Beasts. At last the father said: \u201cWe feel highly\r\nhonoured by your Majesty\u2019s proposal, but you see our daughter is a\r\ntender young thing, and we fear that in the vehemence of your affection\r\nyou might possibly do her some injury. Might I venture to suggest that\r\nyour Majesty should have your claws removed, and your teeth extracted,\r\nthen we would gladly consider your proposal again.\u201d The Lion was so\r\nmuch in love that he had his claws trimmed and his big teeth taken out.\r\nBut when he came again to the parents of the young girl they simply\r\nlaughed in his face, and bade him do his worst.\r\n\r\nLove can tame the wildest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bundle of Sticks\r\n\r\n\r\nAn old man on the point of death summoned his sons around him to give\r\nthem some parting advice. He ordered his servants to bring in a faggot\r\nof sticks, and said to his eldest son: \u201cBreak it.\u201d The son strained and\r\nstrained, but with all his efforts was unable to break the Bundle. The\r\nother sons also tried, but none of them was successful. \u201cUntie the\r\nfaggots,\u201d said the father, \u201cand each of you take a stick.\u201d When they\r\nhad done so, he called out to them: \u201cNow, break,\u201d and each stick was\r\neasily broken. \u201cYou see my meaning,\u201d said their father.\r\n\r\nUnion gives strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion, the Fox, and the Beasts\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion once gave out that he was sick unto death and summoned the\r\nanimals to come and hear his last Will and Testament. So the Goat came\r\nto the Lion\u2019s cave, and stopped there listening for a long time. Then a\r\nSheep went in, and before she came out a Calf came up to receive the\r\nlast wishes of the Lord of the Beasts. But soon the Lion seemed to\r\nrecover, and came to the mouth of his cave, and saw the Fox, who had\r\nbeen waiting outside for some time. \u201cWhy do you not come to pay your\r\nrespects to me?\u201d said the Lion to the Fox.\r\n\r\n\u201cI beg your Majesty\u2019s pardon,\u201d said the Fox, \u201cbut I noticed the track\r\nof the animals that have already come to you; and while I see many\r\nhoof-marks going in, I see none coming out. Till the animals that have\r\nentered your cave come out again I prefer to remain in the open air.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is easier to get into the enemy\u2019s toils than out again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ass\u2019s Brains\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion and the Fox went hunting together. The Lion, on the advice of\r\nthe Fox, sent a message to the Ass, proposing to make an alliance\r\nbetween their two families. The Ass came to the place of meeting,\r\noverjoyed at the prospect of a royal alliance. But when he came there\r\nthe Lion simply pounced on the Ass, and said to the Fox: \u201cHere is our\r\ndinner for to-day. Watch you here while I go and have a nap. Woe betide\r\nyou if you touch my prey.\u201d The Lion went away and the Fox waited; but\r\nfinding that his master did not return, ventured to take out the brains\r\nof the Ass and ate them up. When the Lion came back he soon noticed the\r\nabsence of the brains, and asked the Fox in a terrible voice: \u201cWhat\r\nhave you done with the brains?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBrains, your Majesty! it had none, or it would never have fallen into\r\nyour trap.\u201d\r\n\r\nWit has always an answer ready.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eagle and the Arrow\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Eagle was soaring through the air when suddenly it heard the whizz\r\nof an Arrow, and felt itself wounded to death. Slowly it fluttered down\r\nto the earth, with its life-blood pouring out of it. Looking down upon\r\nthe Arrow with which it had been pierced, it found that the shaft of\r\nthe Arrow had been feathered with one of its own plumes. \u201cAlas!\u201d it\r\ncried, as it died,\r\n\r\n\u201cWe often give our enemies the means for our own destruction.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cat-Maiden\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gods were once disputing whether it was possible for a living being\r\nto change its nature. Jupiter said \u201cYes,\u201d but Venus said \u201cNo.\u201d So, to\r\ntry the question, Jupiter turned a Cat into a Maiden, and gave her to a\r\nyoung man for a wife. The wedding was duly performed and the young\r\ncouple sat down to the wedding-feast. \u201cSee,\u201d said Jupiter, to Venus,\r\n\u201chow becomingly she behaves. Who could tell that yesterday she was but\r\na Cat? Surely her nature is changed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d replied Venus, and let loose a mouse into the room. No\r\nsooner did the bride see this than she jumped up from her seat and\r\ntried to pounce upon the mouse. \u201cAh, you see,\u201d said Venus,\r\n\r\n\u201cNature will out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Milkmaid and Her Pail\r\n\r\n\r\nPatty the Milkmaid was going to market carrying her milk in a Pail on\r\nher head. As she went along she began calculating what she would do\r\nwith the money she would get for the milk. \u201cI\u2019ll buy some fowls from\r\nFarmer Brown,\u201d said she, \u201cand they will lay eggs each morning, which I\r\nwill sell to the parson\u2019s wife. With the money that I get from the sale\r\nof these eggs I\u2019ll buy myself a new dimity frock and a chip hat; and\r\nwhen I go to market, won\u2019t all the young men come up and speak to me!\r\nPolly Shaw will be that jealous; but I don\u2019t care. I shall just look at\r\nher and toss my head like this. As she spoke she tossed her head back,\r\nthe Pail fell off it, and all the milk was spilt. So she had to go home\r\nand tell her mother what had occurred.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, my child,\u201d said the mother,\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not count your chickens before they are hatched.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Horse and the Ass\r\n\r\n\r\nA Horse and an Ass were travelling together, the Horse prancing along\r\nin its fine trappings, the Ass carrying with difficulty the heavy\r\nweight in its panniers. \u201cI wish I were you,\u201d sighed the Ass; \u201cnothing\r\nto do and well fed, and all that fine harness upon you.\u201d Next day,\r\nhowever, there was a great battle, and the Horse was wounded to death\r\nin the final charge of the day. His friend, the Ass, happened to pass\r\nby shortly afterwards and found him on the point of death. \u201cI was\r\nwrong,\u201d said the Ass:\r\n\r\n\u201cBetter humble security than gilded danger.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Trumpeter Taken Prisoner\r\n\r\n\r\nA Trumpeter during a battle ventured too near the enemy and was\r\ncaptured by them. They were about to proceed to put him to death when\r\nhe begged them to hear his plea for mercy. \u201cI do not fight,\u201d said he,\r\n\u201cand indeed carry no weapon; I only blow this trumpet, and surely that\r\ncannot harm you; then why should you kill me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may not fight yourself,\u201d said the others, \u201cbut you encourage and\r\nguide your men to the fight.\u201d\r\n\r\nWords may be deeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Buffoon and the Countryman\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a country fair there was a Buffoon who made all the people laugh by\r\nimitating the cries of various animals. He finished off by squeaking so\r\nlike a pig that the spectators thought that he had a porker concealed\r\nabout him. But a Countryman who stood by said: \u201cCall that a pig\u2019s\r\nsqueak! Nothing like it. You give me till tomorrow and I will show you\r\nwhat it\u2019s like.\u201d The audience laughed, but next day, sure enough, the\r\nCountryman appeared on the stage, and putting his head down squealed so\r\nhideously that the spectators hissed and threw stones at him to make\r\nhim stop. \u201cYou fools!\u201d he cried, \u201csee what you have been hissing,\u201d and\r\nheld up a little pig whose ear he had been pinching to make him utter\r\nthe squeals.\r\n\r\nMen often applaud an imitation and hiss the real thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Old Woman and the Wine-Jar\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must know that sometimes old women like a glass of wine. One of\r\nthis sort once found a Wine-jar lying in the road, and eagerly went up\r\nto it hoping to find it full. But when she took it up she found that\r\nall the wine had been drunk out of it. Still she took a long sniff at\r\nthe mouth of the Jar. \u201cAh,\u201d she cried,\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat memories cling \u2019round the instruments of our pleasure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fox and the Goat\r\n\r\n\r\nBy an unlucky chance a Fox fell into a deep well from which he could\r\nnot get out. A Goat passed by shortly afterwards, and asked the Fox\r\nwhat he was doing down there. \u201cOh, have you not heard?\u201d said the Fox;\r\n\u201cthere is going to be a great drought, so I jumped down here in order\r\nto be sure to have water by me. Why don\u2019t you come down too?\u201d The Goat\r\nthought well of this advice, and jumped down into the well. But the Fox\r\nimmediately jumped on her back, and by putting his foot on her long\r\nhorns managed to jump up to the edge of the well. \u201cGood-bye, friend,\u201d\r\nsaid the Fox, \u201cremember next time,\r\n\r\n\u201cNever trust the advice of a man in difficulties.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this is the end of \u00c6sop\u2019s Fables. HURRAH!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProduced by David Brannan.  HTML version by Al Haines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\r\n\r\n\r\nBy\r\n\r\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the third week of November, in the year 1895, a dense yellow fog\r\nsettled down upon London.  From the Monday to the Thursday I doubt\r\nwhether it was ever possible from our windows in Baker Street to see\r\nthe loom of the opposite houses.  The first day Holmes had spent in\r\ncross-indexing his huge book of references. The second and third had\r\nbeen patiently occupied upon a subject which he had recently made his\r\nhobby--the music of the Middle Ages.  But when, for the fourth time,\r\nafter pushing back our chairs from breakfast we saw the greasy, heavy\r\nbrown swirl still drifting past us and condensing in oily drops upon\r\nthe window-panes, my comrade's impatient and active nature could endure\r\nthis drab existence no longer.  He paced restlessly about our\r\nsitting-room in a fever of suppressed energy, biting his nails, tapping\r\nthe furniture, and chafing against inaction.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of interest in the paper, Watson?\" he said.\r\n\r\nI was aware that by anything of interest, Holmes meant anything of\r\ncriminal interest.  There was the news of a revolution, of a possible\r\nwar, and of an impending change of government; but these did not come\r\nwithin the horizon of my companion.  I could see nothing recorded in\r\nthe shape of crime which was not commonplace and futile.  Holmes\r\ngroaned and resumed his restless meanderings.\r\n\r\n\"The London criminal is certainly a dull fellow,\" said he in the\r\nquerulous voice of the sportsman whose game has failed him. \"Look out\r\nthis window, Watson.  See how the figures loom up, are dimly seen, and\r\nthen blend once more into the cloud-bank.  The thief or the murderer\r\ncould roam London on such a day as the tiger does the jungle, unseen\r\nuntil he pounces, and then evident only to his victim.\"\r\n\r\n\"There have,\" said I, \"been numerous petty thefts.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes snorted his contempt.\r\n\r\n\"This great and sombre stage is set for something more worthy than\r\nthat,\" said he.  \"It is fortunate for this community that I am not a\r\ncriminal.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, indeed!\" said I heartily.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose that I were Brooks or Woodhouse, or any of the fifty men who\r\nhave good reason for taking my life, how long could I survive against\r\nmy own pursuit?  A summons, a bogus appointment, and all would be over.\r\nIt is well they don't have days of fog in the Latin countries--the\r\ncountries of assassination.  By Jove! here comes something at last to\r\nbreak our dead monotony.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the maid with a telegram.  Holmes tore it open and burst out\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!  What next?\" said he.  \"Brother Mycroft is coming round.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?  It is as if you met a tram-car coming down a country lane.\r\nMycroft has his rails and he runs on them.  His Pall Mall lodgings, the\r\nDiogenes Club, Whitehall--that is his cycle.  Once, and only once, he\r\nhas been here.  What upheaval can possibly have derailed him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he not explain?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes handed me his brother's telegram.\r\n\r\n    \"Must see you over Cadogan West.  Coming at once.\"\r\n\r\n     MYCROFT.\r\n\r\n\"Cadogan West?  I have heard the name.\"\r\n\r\n\"It recalls nothing to my mind.  But that Mycroft should break out in\r\nthis erratic fashion!  A planet might as well leave its orbit.  By the\r\nway, do you know what Mycroft is?\"\r\n\r\nI had some vague recollection of an explanation at the time of the\r\nAdventure of the Greek Interpreter.\r\n\r\n\"You told me that he had some small office under the British\r\ngovernment.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes chuckled.\r\n\r\n\"I did not know you quite so well in those days.  One has to be\r\ndiscreet when one talks of high matters of state.  You are right in\r\nthinking that he is under the British government.  You would also be right\r\nin a sense if you said that occasionally he IS the British government.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Holmes!\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought I might surprise you.  Mycroft draws four hundred and fifty\r\npounds a year, remains a subordinate, has no ambitions of any kind,\r\nwill receive neither honour nor title, but remains the most\r\nindispensable man in the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, his position is unique.  He has made it for himself. There has\r\nnever been anything like it before, nor will be again. He has the\r\ntidiest and most orderly brain, with the greatest capacity for storing\r\nfacts, of any man living.  The same great powers which I have turned to\r\nthe detection of crime he has used for this particular business.  The\r\nconclusions of every department are passed to him, and he is the\r\ncentral exchange, the clearinghouse, which makes out the balance.  All\r\nother men are specialists, but his specialism is omniscience.  We will\r\nsuppose that a minister needs information as to a point which involves\r\nthe Navy, India, Canada and the bimetallic question; he could get his\r\nseparate advices from various departments upon each, but only Mycroft\r\ncan focus them all, and say offhand how each factor would affect the\r\nother.  They began by using him as a short-cut, a convenience; now he\r\nhas made himself an essential.  In that great brain of his everything\r\nis pigeon-holed and can be handed out in an instant.  Again and again\r\nhis word has decided the national policy.  He lives in it.  He thinks\r\nof nothing else save when, as an intellectual exercise, he unbends if I\r\ncall upon him and ask him to advise me on one of my little problems.\r\nBut Jupiter is descending to-day.  What on earth can it mean?  Who is\r\nCadogan West, and what is he to Mycroft?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have it,\" I cried, and plunged among the litter of papers upon the\r\nsofa.  \"Yes, yes, here he is, sure enough!  Cadogan West was the young\r\nman who was found dead on the Underground on Tuesday morning.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes sat up at attention, his pipe halfway to his lips.\r\n\r\n\"This must be serious, Watson.  A death which has caused my brother to\r\nalter his habits can be no ordinary one.  What in the world can he have\r\nto do with it?  The case was featureless as I remember it.  The young\r\nman had apparently fallen out of the train and killed himself.  He had\r\nnot been robbed, and there was no particular reason to suspect\r\nviolence.  Is that not so?\"\r\n\r\n\"There has been an inquest,\" said I, \"and a good many fresh facts have\r\ncome out.  Looked at more closely, I should certainly say that it was a\r\ncurious case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Judging by its effect upon my brother, I should think it must be a\r\nmost extraordinary one.\"  He snuggled down in his armchair. \"Now,\r\nWatson, let us have the facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"The man's name was Arthur Cadogan West.  He was twenty-seven years of\r\nage, unmarried, and a clerk at Woolwich Arsenal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Government employ.  Behold the link with Brother Mycroft!\"\r\n\r\n\"He left Woolwich suddenly on Monday night.  Was last seen by his\r\nfiancee, Miss Violet Westbury, whom he left abruptly in the fog about\r\n7:30 that evening.  There was no quarrel between them and she can give\r\nno motive for his action.  The next thing heard of him was when his\r\ndead body was discovered by a plate-layer named Mason, just outside\r\nAldgate Station on the Underground system in London.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\"\r\n\r\n\"The body was found at six on Tuesday morning.  It was lying wide of\r\nthe metals upon the left hand of the track as one goes eastward, at a\r\npoint close to the station, where the line emerges from the tunnel in\r\nwhich it runs.  The head was badly crushed--an injury which might well\r\nhave been caused by a fall from the train.  The body could only have\r\ncome on the line in that way. Had it been carried down from any\r\nneighbouring street, it must have passed the station barriers, where a\r\ncollector is always standing.  This point seems absolutely certain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good.  The case is definite enough.  The man, dead or alive,\r\neither fell or was precipitated from a train.  So much is clear to me.\r\nContinue.\"\r\n\r\n\"The trains which traverse the lines of rail beside which the body was\r\nfound are those which run from west to east, some being purely\r\nMetropolitan, and some from Willesden and outlying junctions.  It can\r\nbe stated for certain that this young man, when he met his death, was\r\ntravelling in this direction at some late hour of the night, but at\r\nwhat point he entered the train it is impossible to state.\"\r\n\r\n\"His ticket, of course, would show that.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was no ticket in his pockets.\"\r\n\r\n\"No ticket!  Dear me, Watson, this is really very singular. According\r\nto my experience it is not possible to reach the platform of a\r\nMetropolitan train without exhibiting one's ticket. Presumably, then,\r\nthe young man had one.  Was it taken from him in order to conceal the\r\nstation from which he came?  It is possible.  Or did he drop it in the\r\ncarriage?  That is also possible.  But the point is of curious\r\ninterest.  I understand that there was no sign of robbery?\"\r\n\r\n\"Apparently not.  There is a list here of his possessions.  His purse\r\ncontained two pounds fifteen.  He had also a check-book on the Woolwich\r\nbranch of the Capital and Counties Bank.  Through this his identity was\r\nestablished.  There were also two dress-circle tickets for the Woolwich\r\nTheatre, dated for that very evening.  Also a small packet of technical\r\npapers.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes gave an exclamation of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"There we have it at last, Watson!  British government--Woolwich.\r\nArsenal--technical papers--Brother Mycroft, the chain is complete.  But\r\nhere he comes, if I am not mistaken, to speak for himself.\"\r\n\r\nA moment later the tall and portly form of Mycroft Holmes was ushered\r\ninto the room.  Heavily built and massive, there was a suggestion of\r\nuncouth physical inertia in the figure, but above this unwieldy frame\r\nthere was perched a head so masterful in its brow, so alert in its\r\nsteel-gray, deep-set eyes, so firm in its lips, and so subtle in its\r\nplay of expression, that after the first glance one forgot the gross\r\nbody and remembered only the dominant mind.\r\n\r\nAt his heels came our old friend Lestrade, of Scotland Yard--thin and\r\naustere.  The gravity of both their faces foretold some weighty quest.\r\nThe detective shook hands without a word. Mycroft Holmes struggled out\r\nof his overcoat and subsided into an armchair.\r\n\r\n\"A most annoying business, Sherlock,\" said he.  \"I extremely dislike\r\naltering my habits, but the powers that be would take no denial.  In\r\nthe present state of Siam it is most awkward that I should be away from\r\nthe office.  But it is a real crisis.  I have never seen the Prime\r\nMinister so upset.  As to the Admiralty--it is buzzing like an\r\noverturned bee-hive.  Have you read up the case?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have just done so.  What were the technical papers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, there's the point!  Fortunately, it has not come out.  The press\r\nwould be furious if it did.  The papers which this wretched youth had\r\nin his pocket were the plans of the Bruce-Partington submarine.\"\r\n\r\nMycroft Holmes spoke with a solemnity which showed his sense of the\r\nimportance of the subject.  His brother and I sat expectant.\r\n\r\n\"Surely you have heard of it?  I thought everyone had heard of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only as a name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Its importance can hardly be exaggerated.  It has been the most\r\njealously guarded of all government secrets.  You may take it from me\r\nthat naval warfare becomes impossible within the radius of a\r\nBruce-Partington's operation.  Two years ago a very large sum was\r\nsmuggled through the Estimates and was expended in acquiring a monopoly\r\nof the invention.  Every effort has been made to keep the secret.  The\r\nplans, which are exceedingly intricate, comprising some thirty separate\r\npatents, each essential to the working of the whole, are kept in an\r\nelaborate safe in a confidential office adjoining the arsenal, with\r\nburglar-proof doors and windows.  Under no conceivable circumstances\r\nwere the plans to be taken from the office.  If the chief constructor\r\nof the Navy desired to consult them, even he was forced to go to the\r\nWoolwich office for the purpose.  And yet here we find them in the\r\npocket of a dead junior clerk in the heart of London.  From an official\r\npoint of view it's simply awful.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have recovered them?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Sherlock, no!  That's the pinch.  We have not.  Ten papers were\r\ntaken from Woolwich.  There were seven in the pocket of Cadogan West.\r\nThe three most essential are gone--stolen, vanished.  You must drop\r\neverything, Sherlock.  Never mind your usual petty puzzles of the\r\npolice-court.  It's a vital international problem that you have to\r\nsolve.  Why did Cadogan West take the papers, where are the missing\r\nones, how did he die, how came his body where it was found, how can the\r\nevil be set right?  Find an answer to all these questions, and you will\r\nhave done good service for your country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you not solve it yourself, Mycroft?  You can see as far as I.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly, Sherlock.  But it is a question of getting details. Give me\r\nyour details, and from an armchair I will return you an excellent\r\nexpert opinion.  But to run here and run there, to cross-question\r\nrailway guards, and lie on my face with a lens to my eye--it is not my\r\nmetier.  No, you are the one man who can clear the matter up.  If you\r\nhave a fancy to see your name in the next honours list--\"\r\n\r\nMy friend smiled and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I play the game for the game's own sake,\" said he.  \"But the problem\r\ncertainly presents some points of interest, and I shall be very pleased\r\nto look into it.  Some more facts, please.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have jotted down the more essential ones upon this sheet of paper,\r\ntogether with a few addresses which you will find of service.  The\r\nactual official guardian of the papers is the famous government expert,\r\nSir James Walter, whose decorations and sub-titles fill two lines of a\r\nbook of reference.  He has grown gray in the service, is a gentleman, a\r\nfavoured guest in the most exalted houses, and, above all, a man whose\r\npatriotism is beyond suspicion.  He is one of two who have a key of the\r\nsafe.  I may add that the papers were undoubtedly in the office during\r\nworking hours on Monday, and that Sir James left for London about three\r\no'clock taking his key with him.  He was at the house of Admiral\r\nSinclair at Barclay Square during the whole of the evening when this\r\nincident occurred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has the fact been verified?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; his brother, Colonel Valentine Walter, has testified to his\r\ndeparture from Woolwich, and Admiral Sinclair to his arrival in London;\r\nso Sir James is no longer a direct factor in the problem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was the other man with a key?\"\r\n\r\n\"The senior clerk and draughtsman, Mr. Sidney Johnson.  He is a man of\r\nforty, married, with five children.  He is a silent, morose man, but he\r\nhas, on the whole, an excellent record in the public service.  He is\r\nunpopular with his colleagues, but a hard worker.  According to his own\r\naccount, corroborated only by the word of his wife, he was at home the\r\nwhole of Monday evening after office hours, and his key has never left\r\nthe watch-chain upon which it hangs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us about Cadogan West.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has been ten years in the service and has done good work.  He has\r\nthe reputation of being hot-headed and imperious, but a straight,\r\nhonest man.  We have nothing against him.  He was next Sidney Johnson\r\nin the office.  His duties brought him into daily, personal contact\r\nwith the plans.  No one else had the handling of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who locked up the plans that night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is surely perfectly clear who took them away.  They are\r\nactually found upon the person of this junior clerk, Cadogan West.\r\nThat seems final, does it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"It does, Sherlock, and yet it leaves so much unexplained.  In the\r\nfirst place, why did he take them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I presume they were of value?\"\r\n\r\n\"He could have got several thousands for them very easily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you suggest any possible motive for taking the papers to London\r\nexcept to sell them?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I cannot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we must take that as our working hypothesis.  Young West took the\r\npapers.  Now this could only be done by having a false key--\"\r\n\r\n\"Several false keys.  He had to open the building and the room.\"\r\n\r\n\"He had, then, several false keys.  He took the papers to London to\r\nsell the secret, intending, no doubt, to have the plans themselves back\r\nin the safe next morning before they were missed. While in London on\r\nthis treasonable mission he met his end.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"We will suppose that he was travelling back to Woolwich when he was\r\nkilled and thrown out of the compartment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aldgate, where the body was found, is considerably past the station\r\nLondon Bridge, which would be his route to Woolwich.\"\r\n\r\n\"Many circumstances could be imagined under which he would pass London\r\nBridge.  There was someone in the carriage, for example, with whom he\r\nwas having an absorbing interview.  This interview led to a violent\r\nscene in which he lost his life.  Possibly he tried to leave the\r\ncarriage, fell out on the line, and so met his end.  The other closed\r\nthe door.  There was a thick fog, and nothing could be seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"No better explanation can be given with our present knowledge; and yet\r\nconsider, Sherlock, how much you leave untouched.  We will suppose, for\r\nargument's sake, that young Cadogan West HAD determined to convey these\r\npapers to London.  He would naturally have made an appointment with the\r\nforeign agent and kept his evening clear.  Instead of that he took two\r\ntickets for the theatre, escorted his fiancee halfway there, and then\r\nsuddenly disappeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"A blind,\" said Lestrade, who had sat listening with some impatience to\r\nthe conversation.\r\n\r\n\"A very singular one.  That is objection No. 1.  Objection No. 2: We\r\nwill suppose that he reaches London and sees the foreign agent.  He\r\nmust bring back the papers before morning or the loss will be\r\ndiscovered.  He took away ten.  Only seven were in his pocket.  What\r\nhad become of the other three?  He certainly would not leave them of\r\nhis own free will.  Then, again, where is the price of his treason?\r\nOnce would have expected to find a large sum of money in his pocket.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me perfectly clear,\" said Lestrade.  \"I have no doubt at\r\nall as to what occurred.  He took the papers to sell them.  He saw the\r\nagent. They could not agree as to price.  He started home again, but\r\nthe agent went with him.  In the train the agent murdered him, took the\r\nmore essential papers, and threw his body from the carriage.  That\r\nwould account for everything, would it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why had he no ticket?\"\r\n\r\n\"The ticket would have shown which station was nearest the agent's\r\nhouse.  Therefore he took it from the murdered man's pocket.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good, Lestrade, very good,\" said Holmes.  \"Your theory holds together.\r\nBut if this is true, then the case is at an end.  On the one hand, the\r\ntraitor is dead.  On the other, the plans of the Bruce-Partington\r\nsubmarine are presumably already on the Continent.  What is there for\r\nus to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"To act, Sherlock--to act!\" cried Mycroft, springing to his feet. \"All\r\nmy instincts are against this explanation.  Use your powers! Go to the\r\nscene of the crime!  See the people concerned!  Leave no stone\r\nunturned!  In all your career you have never had so great a chance of\r\nserving your country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!\" said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders.  \"Come, Watson!\r\nAnd you, Lestrade, could you favour us with your company for an hour or\r\ntwo?  We will begin our investigation by a visit to Aldgate Station.\r\nGood-bye, Mycroft.  I shall let you have a report before evening, but I\r\nwarn you in advance that you have little to expect.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour later Holmes, Lestrade and I stood upon the Underground\r\nrailroad at the point where it emerges from the tunnel immediately\r\nbefore Aldgate Station.  A courteous red-faced old gentleman\r\nrepresented the railway company.\r\n\r\n\"This is where the young man's body lay,\" said he, indicating a spot\r\nabout three feet from the metals.  \"It could not have fallen from\r\nabove, for these, as you see, are all blank walls. Therefore, it could\r\nonly have come from a train, and that train, so far as we can trace it,\r\nmust have passed about midnight on Monday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have the carriages been examined for any sign of violence?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are no such signs, and no ticket has been found.\"\r\n\r\n\"No record of a door being found open?\"\r\n\r\n\"None.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have had some fresh evidence this morning,\" said Lestrade. \"A\r\npassenger who passed Aldgate in an ordinary Metropolitan train about\r\n11:40 on Monday night declares that he heard a heavy thud, as of a body\r\nstriking the line, just before the train reached the station.  There\r\nwas dense fog, however, and nothing could be seen.  He made no report\r\nof it at the time.  Why, whatever is the matter with Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\nMy friend was standing with an expression of strained intensity upon\r\nhis face, staring at the railway metals where they curved out of the\r\ntunnel.  Aldgate is a junction, and there was a network of points.  On\r\nthese his eager, questioning eyes were fixed, and I saw on his keen,\r\nalert face that tightening of the lips, that quiver of the nostrils,\r\nand concentration of the heavy, tufted brows which I knew so well.\r\n\r\n\"Points,\" he muttered; \"the points.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of it?  What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose there are no great number of points on a system such as\r\nthis?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; they are very few.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a curve, too.  Points, and a curve.  By Jove! if it were only so.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Mr. Holmes?  Have you a clue?\"\r\n\r\n\"An idea--an indication, no more.  But the case certainly grows in\r\ninterest.  Unique, perfectly unique, and yet why not?  I do not see any\r\nindications of bleeding on the line.\"\r\n\r\n\"There were hardly any.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I understand that there was a considerable wound.\"\r\n\r\n\"The bone was crushed, but there was no great external injury.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet one would have expected some bleeding.  Would it be possible\r\nfor me to inspect the train which contained the passenger who heard the\r\nthud of a fall in the fog?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear not, Mr. Holmes.  The train has been broken up before now, and\r\nthe carriages redistributed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can assure you, Mr. Holmes,\" said Lestrade, \"that every carriage has\r\nbeen carefully examined.  I saw to it myself.\"\r\n\r\nIt was one of my friend's most obvious weaknesses that he was impatient\r\nwith less alert intelligences than his own.\r\n\r\n\"Very likely,\" said he, turning away.  \"As it happens, it was not the\r\ncarriages which I desired to examine.  Watson, we have done all we can\r\nhere.  We need not trouble you any further, Mr. Lestrade.  I think our\r\ninvestigations must now carry us to Woolwich.\"\r\n\r\nAt London Bridge, Holmes wrote a telegram to his brother, which he\r\nhanded to me before dispatching it.  It ran thus:\r\n\r\nSee some light in the darkness, but it may possibly flicker out.\r\nMeanwhile, please send by messenger, to await return at Baker Street, a\r\ncomplete list of all foreign spies or international agents known to be\r\nin England, with full address.\r\n\r\nSherlock.\r\n\r\n\"That should be helpful, Watson,\" he remarked as we took our seats in\r\nthe Woolwich train.  \"We certainly owe Brother Mycroft a debt for\r\nhaving introduced us to what promises to be a really very remarkable\r\ncase.\"\r\n\r\nHis eager face still wore that expression of intense and high-strung\r\nenergy, which showed me that some novel and suggestive circumstance had\r\nopened up a stimulating line of thought.  See the foxhound with hanging\r\nears and drooping tail as it lolls about the kennels, and compare it\r\nwith the same hound as, with gleaming eyes and straining muscles, it\r\nruns upon a breast-high scent--such was the change in Holmes since the\r\nmorning.  He was a different man from the limp and lounging figure in\r\nthe mouse-coloured dressing-gown who had prowled so restlessly only a\r\nfew hours before round the fog-girt room.\r\n\r\n\"There is material here.  There is scope,\" said he.  \"I am dull indeed\r\nnot to have understood its possibilities.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even now they are dark to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"The end is dark to me also, but I have hold of one idea which may lead\r\nus far.  The man met his death elsewhere, and his body was on the ROOF\r\nof a carriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the roof!\"\r\n\r\n\"Remarkable, is it not?  But consider the facts.  Is it a coincidence\r\nthat it is found at the very point where the train pitches and sways as\r\nit comes round on the points?  Is not that the place where an object\r\nupon the roof might be expected to fall off?  The points would affect\r\nno object inside the train.  Either the body fell from the roof, or a\r\nvery curious coincidence has occurred.  But now consider the question\r\nof the blood.  Of course, there was no bleeding on the line if the body\r\nhad bled elsewhere.  Each fact is suggestive in itself.  Together they\r\nhave a cumulative force.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the ticket, too!\" I cried.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.  We could not explain the absence of a ticket.  This would\r\nexplain it.  Everything fits together.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose it were so, we are still as far as ever from unravelling\r\nthe mystery of his death.  Indeed, it becomes not simpler but stranger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said Holmes, thoughtfully, \"perhaps.\"  He relapsed into a\r\nsilent reverie, which lasted until the slow train drew up at last in\r\nWoolwich Station.  There he called a cab and drew Mycroft's paper from\r\nhis pocket.\r\n\r\n\"We have quite a little round of afternoon calls to make,\" said he.  \"I\r\nthink that Sir James Walter claims our first attention.\"\r\n\r\nThe house of the famous official was a fine villa with green lawns\r\nstretching down to the Thames.  As we reached it the fog was lifting,\r\nand a thin, watery sunshine was breaking through.  A butler answered\r\nour ring.\r\n\r\n\"Sir James, sir!\" said he with solemn face.  \"Sir James died this\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Holmes in amazement.  \"How did he die?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you would care to step in, sir, and see his brother, Colonel\r\nValentine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we had best do so.\"\r\n\r\nWe were ushered into a dim-lit drawing-room, where an instant later we\r\nwere joined by a very tall, handsome, light-beared man of fifty, the\r\nyounger brother of the dead scientist.  His wild eyes, stained cheeks,\r\nand unkempt hair all spoke of the sudden blow which had fallen upon the\r\nhousehold.  He was hardly articulate as he spoke of it.\r\n\r\n\"It was this horrible scandal,\" said he.  \"My brother, Sir James, was a\r\nman of very sensitive honour, and he could not survive such an affair.\r\nIt broke his heart.  He was always so proud of the efficiency of his\r\ndepartment, and this was a crushing blow.\"\r\n\r\n\"We had hoped that he might have given us some indications which would\r\nhave helped us to clear the matter up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you that it was all a mystery to him as it is to you and to\r\nall of us.  He had already put all his knowledge at the disposal of the\r\npolice.  Naturally he had no doubt that Cadogan West was guilty.  But\r\nall the rest was inconceivable.\"\r\n\r\n\"You cannot throw any new light upon the affair?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing myself save what I have read or heard.  I have no\r\ndesire to be discourteous, but you can understand, Mr. Holmes, that we\r\nare much disturbed at present, and I must ask you to hasten this\r\ninterview to an end.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is indeed an unexpected development,\" said my friend when we had\r\nregained the cab.  \"I wonder if the death was natural, or whether the\r\npoor old fellow killed himself!  If the latter, may it be taken as some\r\nsign of self-reproach for duty neglected?  We must leave that question\r\nto the future.  Now we shall turn to the Cadogan Wests.\"\r\n\r\nA small but well-kept house in the outskirts of the town sheltered the\r\nbereaved mother.  The old lady was too dazed with grief to be of any\r\nuse to us, but at her side was a white-faced young lady, who introduced\r\nherself as Miss Violet Westbury, the fiancee of the dead man, and the\r\nlast to see him upon that fatal night.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot explain it, Mr. Holmes,\" she said.  \"I have not shut an eye\r\nsince the tragedy, thinking, thinking, thinking, night and day, what\r\nthe true meaning of it can be.  Arthur was the most single-minded,\r\nchivalrous, patriotic man upon earth.  He would have cut his right hand\r\noff before he would sell a State secret confided to his keeping.  It is\r\nabsurd, impossible, preposterous to anyone who knew him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the facts, Miss Westbury?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes; I admit I cannot explain them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was he in any want of money?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; his needs were very simple and his salary ample.  He had saved a\r\nfew hundreds, and we were to marry at the New Year.\"\r\n\r\n\"No signs of any mental excitement?  Come, Miss Westbury, be absolutely\r\nfrank with us.\"\r\n\r\nThe quick eye of my companion had noted some change in her manner.  She\r\ncoloured and hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said at last, \"I had a feeling that there was something on\r\nhis mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"For long?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only for the last week or so.  He was thoughtful and worried. Once I\r\npressed him about it.  He admitted that there was something, and that\r\nit was concerned with his official life.  'It is too serious for me to\r\nspeak about, even to you,' said he.  I could get nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes looked grave.\r\n\r\n\"Go on, Miss Westbury.  Even if it seems to tell against him, go on.\r\nWe cannot say what it may lead to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, I have nothing more to tell.  Once or twice it seemed to me\r\nthat he was on the point of telling me something.  He spoke one evening\r\nof the importance of the secret, and I have some recollection that he\r\nsaid that no doubt foreign spies would pay a great deal to have it.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend's face grew graver still.\r\n\r\n\"Anything else?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said that we were slack about such matters--that it would be easy\r\nfor a traitor to get the plans.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it only recently that he made such remarks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, quite recently.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now tell us of that last evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were to go to the theatre.  The fog was so thick that a cab was\r\nuseless.  We walked, and our way took us close to the office. Suddenly\r\nhe darted away into the fog.\"\r\n\r\n\"Without a word?\"\r\n\r\n\"He gave an exclamation; that was all.  I waited but he never returned.\r\nThen I walked home.  Next morning, after the office opened, they came\r\nto inquire.  About twelve o'clock we heard the terrible news.  Oh, Mr.\r\nHolmes, if you could only, only save his honour!  It was so much to\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Watson,\" said he, \"our ways lie elsewhere.  Our next station\r\nmust be the office from which the papers were taken.\r\n\r\n\"It was black enough before against this young man, but our inquiries\r\nmake it blacker,\" he remarked as the cab lumbered off. \"His coming\r\nmarriage gives a motive for the crime.  He naturally wanted money.  The\r\nidea was in his head, since he spoke about it. He nearly made the girl\r\nan accomplice in the treason by telling her his plans.  It is all very\r\nbad.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely, Holmes, character goes for something?  Then, again, why\r\nshould he leave the girl in the street and dart away to commit a\r\nfelony?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly!  There are certainly objections.  But it is a formidable case\r\nwhich they have to meet.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk, met us at the office and received\r\nus with that respect which my companion's card always commanded.  He\r\nwas a thin, gruff, bespectacled man of middle age, his cheeks haggard,\r\nand his hands twitching from the nervous strain to which he had been\r\nsubjected.\r\n\r\n\"It is bad, Mr. Holmes, very bad!  Have you heard of the death of the\r\nchief?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have just come from his house.\"\r\n\r\n\"The place is disorganized.  The chief dead, Cadogan West dead, our\r\npapers stolen.  And yet, when we closed our door on Monday evening, we\r\nwere as efficient an office as any in the government service.  Good\r\nGod, it's dreadful to think of!  That West, of all men, should have\r\ndone such a thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are sure of his guilt, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can see no other way out of it.  And yet I would have trusted him as\r\nI trust myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"At what hour was the office closed on Monday?\"\r\n\r\n\"At five.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you close it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am always the last man out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where were the plans?\"\r\n\r\n\"In that safe.  I put them there myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there no watchman to the building?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is, but he has other departments to look after as well. He is an\r\nold soldier and a most trustworthy man.  He saw nothing that evening.\r\nOf course the fog was very thick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose that Cadogan West wished to make his way into the building\r\nafter hours; he would need three keys, would he not, before he could\r\nreach the papers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he would.  The key of the outer door, the key of the office, and\r\nthe key of the safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only Sir James Walter and you had those keys?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had no keys of the doors--only of the safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was Sir James a man who was orderly in his habits?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think he was.  I know that so far as those three keys are\r\nconcerned he kept them on the same ring.  I have often seen them there.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that ring went with him to London?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your key never left your possession?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then West, if he is the culprit, must have had a duplicate.  And yet\r\nnone was found upon his body.  One other point:  if a clerk in this\r\noffice desired to sell the plans, would it not be simpler to copy the\r\nplans for himself than to take the originals, as was actually done?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would take considerable technical knowledge to copy the plans in an\r\neffective way.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I suppose either Sir James, or you, or West has that technical\r\nknowledge?\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt we had, but I beg you won't try to drag me into the matter,\r\nMr. Holmes.  What is the use of our speculating in this way when the\r\noriginal plans were actually found on West?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is certainly singular that he should run the risk of taking\r\noriginals if he could safely have taken copies, which would have\r\nequally served his turn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Singular, no doubt--and yet he did so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every inquiry in this case reveals something inexplicable.  Now there\r\nare three papers still missing.  They are, as I understand, the vital\r\nones.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say that anyone holding these three papers, and without\r\nthe seven others, could construct a Bruce-Partington submarine?\"\r\n\r\n\"I reported to that effect to the Admiralty.  But to-day I have been\r\nover the drawings again, and I am not so sure of it.  The double valves\r\nwith the automatic self-adjusting slots are drawn in one of the papers\r\nwhich have been returned.  Until the foreigners had invented that for\r\nthemselves they could not make the boat.  Of course they might soon get\r\nover the difficulty.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the three missing drawings are the most important?\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think, with your permission, I will now take a stroll round the\r\npremises.  I do not recall any other question which I desired to ask.\"\r\n\r\nHe examined the lock of the safe, the door of the room, and finally the\r\niron shutters of the window.  It was only when we were on the lawn\r\noutside that his interest was strongly excited. There was a laurel bush\r\noutside the window, and several of the branches bore signs of having\r\nbeen twisted or snapped.  He examined them carefully with his lens, and\r\nthen some dim and vague marks upon the earth beneath.  Finally he asked\r\nthe chief clerk to close the iron shutters, and he pointed out to me\r\nthat they hardly met in the centre, and that it would be possible for\r\nanyone outside to see what was going on within the room.\r\n\r\n\"The indications are ruined by three days' delay.  They may mean\r\nsomething or nothing.  Well, Watson, I do not think that Woolwich can\r\nhelp us further.  It is a small crop which we have gathered. Let us see\r\nif we can do better in London.\"\r\n\r\nYet we added one more sheaf to our harvest before we left Woolwich\r\nStation.  The clerk in the ticket office was able to say with\r\nconfidence that he saw Cadogan West--whom he knew well by sight--upon\r\nthe Monday night, and that he went to London by the 8:15 to London\r\nBridge.  He was alone and took a single third-class ticket.  The clerk\r\nwas struck at the time by his excited and nervous manner.  So shaky was\r\nhe that he could hardly pick up his change, and the clerk had helped\r\nhim with it.  A reference to the timetable showed that the 8:15 was the\r\nfirst train which it was possible for West to take after he had left\r\nthe lady about 7:30.\r\n\r\n\"Let us reconstruct, Watson,\" said Holmes after half an hour of\r\nsilence.  \"I am not aware that in all our joint researches we have ever\r\nhad a case which was more difficult to get at.  Every fresh advance\r\nwhich we make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond. And yet we have surely\r\nmade some appreciable progress.\r\n\r\n\"The effect of our inquiries at Woolwich has in the main been against\r\nyoung Cadogan West; but the indications at the window would lend\r\nthemselves to a more favourable hypothesis.  Let us suppose, for\r\nexample, that he had been approached by some foreign agent.  It might\r\nhave been done under such pledges as would have prevented him from\r\nspeaking of it, and yet would have affected his thoughts in the\r\ndirection indicated by his remarks to his fiancee.  Very good.  We will\r\nnow suppose that as he went to the theatre with the young lady he\r\nsuddenly, in the fog, caught a glimpse of this same agent going in the\r\ndirection of the office. He was an impetuous man, quick in his\r\ndecisions.  Everything gave way to his duty.  He followed the man,\r\nreached the window, saw the abstraction of the documents, and pursued\r\nthe thief.  In this way we get over the objection that no one would\r\ntake originals when he could make copies.  This outsider had to take\r\noriginals. So far it holds together.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the next step?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we come into difficulties.  One would imagine that under such\r\ncircumstances the first act of young Cadogan West would be to seize the\r\nvillain and raise the alarm.  Why did he not do so? Could it have been\r\nan official superior who took the papers? That would explain West's\r\nconduct.  Or could the chief have given West the slip in the fog, and\r\nWest started at once to London to head him off from his own rooms,\r\npresuming that he knew where the rooms were?  The call must have been\r\nvery pressing, since he left his girl standing in the fog and made no\r\neffort to communicate with her.  Our scent runs cold here, and there is\r\na vast gap between either hypothesis and the laying of West's body,\r\nwith seven papers in his pocket, on the roof of a Metropolitan train.\r\nMy instinct now is to work from the other end.  If Mycroft has given us\r\nthe list of addresses we may be able to pick our man and follow two\r\ntracks instead of one.\"\r\n\r\nSurely enough, a note awaited us at Baker Street.  A government\r\nmessenger had brought it post-haste.  Holmes glanced at it and threw it\r\nover to me.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous small fry, but few who would handle so big an\r\naffair.  The only men worth considering are Adolph Mayer, of 13 Great\r\nGeorge Street, Westminster; Louis La Rothiere, of Campden Mansions,\r\nNotting Hill; and Hugo Oberstein, 13 Caulfield Gardens, Kensington.\r\nThe latter was known to be in town on Monday and is now reported as\r\nhaving left.  Glad to hear you have seen some light.  The Cabinet\r\nawaits your final report with the utmost anxiety.  Urgent\r\nrepresentations have arrived from the very highest quarter.  The whole\r\nforce of the State is at your back if you should need it.\r\n\r\nMycroft.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid,\" said Holmes, smiling, \"that all the queen's horses and\r\nall the queen's men cannot avail in this matter.\"  He had spread out\r\nhis big map of London and leaned eagerly over it. \"Well, well,\" said he\r\npresently with an exclamation of satisfaction, \"things are turning a\r\nlittle in our direction at last.  Why, Watson, I do honestly believe\r\nthat we are going to pull it off, after all.\"  He slapped me on the\r\nshoulder with a sudden burst of hilarity.  \"I am going out now.  It is\r\nonly a reconnaissance.  I will do nothing serious without my trusted\r\ncomrade and biographer at my elbow.  Do you stay here, and the odds are\r\nthat you will see me again in an hour or two.  If time hangs heavy get\r\nfoolscap and a pen, and begin your narrative of how we saved the State.\"\r\n\r\nI felt some reflection of his elation in my own mind, for I knew well\r\nthat he would not depart so far from his usual austerity of demeanour\r\nunless there was good cause for exultation.  All the long November\r\nevening I waited, filled with impatience for his return.  At last,\r\nshortly after nine o'clock, there arrived a messenger with a note:\r\n\r\nAm dining at Goldini's Restaurant, Gloucester Road, Kensington. Please\r\ncome at once and join me there.  Bring with you a jemmy, a dark\r\nlantern, a chisel, and a revolver.\r\n\r\nS.H.\r\n\r\nIt was a nice equipment for a respectable citizen to carry through the\r\ndim, fog-draped streets.  I stowed them all discreetly away in my\r\novercoat and drove straight to the address given.  There sat my friend\r\nat a little round table near the door of the garish Italian restaurant.\r\n\r\n\"Have you had something to eat?  Then join me in a coffee and curacao.\r\nTry one of the proprietor's cigars.  They are less poisonous than one\r\nwould expect.  Have you the tools?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are here, in my overcoat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent.  Let me give you a short sketch of what I have done, with\r\nsome indication of what we are about to do.  Now it must be evident to\r\nyou, Watson, that this young man's body was PLACED on the roof of the\r\ntrain.  That was clear from the instant that I determined the fact that\r\nit was from the roof, and not from a carriage, that he had fallen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could it not have been dropped from a bridge?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say it was impossible.  If you examine the roofs you will\r\nfind that they are slightly rounded, and there is no railing round\r\nthem.  Therefore, we can say for certain that young Cadogan West was\r\nplaced on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could he be placed there?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was the question which we had to answer.  There is only one\r\npossible way.  You are aware that the Underground runs clear of tunnels\r\nat some points in the West End.  I had a vague memory that as I have\r\ntravelled by it I have occasionally seen windows just above my head.\r\nNow, suppose that a train halted under such a window, would there be\r\nany difficulty in laying a body upon the roof?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems most improbable.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must fall back upon the old axiom that when all other contingencies\r\nfail, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.  Here\r\nall other contingencies HAVE failed.  When I found that the leading\r\ninternational agent, who had just left London, lived in a row of houses\r\nwhich abutted upon the Underground, I was so pleased that you were a\r\nlittle astonished at my sudden frivolity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that was it, was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that was it.  Mr. Hugo Oberstein, of 13 Caulfield Gardens, had\r\nbecome my objective.  I began my operations at Gloucester Road Station,\r\nwhere a very helpful official walked with me along the track and\r\nallowed me to satisfy myself not only that the back-stair windows of\r\nCaulfield Gardens open on the line but the even more essential fact\r\nthat, owing to the intersection of one of the larger railways, the\r\nUnderground trains are frequently held motionless for some minutes at\r\nthat very spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Splendid, Holmes!  You have got it!\"\r\n\r\n\"So far--so far, Watson.  We advance, but the goal is afar. Well,\r\nhaving seen the back of Caulfield Gardens, I visited the front and\r\nsatisfied myself that the bird was indeed flown.  It is a considerable\r\nhouse, unfurnished, so far as I could judge, in the upper rooms.\r\nOberstein lived there with a single valet, who was probably a\r\nconfederate entirely in his confidence.  We must bear in mind that\r\nOberstein has gone to the Continent to dispose of his booty, but not\r\nwith any idea of flight; for he had no reason to fear a warrant, and\r\nthe idea of an amateur domiciliary visit would certainly never occur to\r\nhim.  Yet that is precisely what we are about to make.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could we not get a warrant and legalize it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly on the evidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can we hope to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"We cannot tell what correspondence may be there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't like it, Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, you shall keep watch in the street.  I'll do the\r\ncriminal part.  It's not a time to stick at trifles.  Think of\r\nMycroft's note, of the Admiralty, the Cabinet, the exalted person who\r\nwaits for news.  We are bound to go.\"\r\n\r\nMy answer was to rise from the table.\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Holmes.  We are bound to go.\"\r\n\r\nHe sprang up and shook me by the hand.\r\n\r\n\"I knew you would not shrink at the last,\" said he, and for a moment I\r\nsaw something in his eyes which was nearer to tenderness than I had\r\never seen.  The next instant he was his masterful, practical self once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\"It is nearly half a mile, but there is no hurry.  Let us walk,\" said\r\nhe.  \"Don't drop the instruments, I beg.  Your arrest as a suspicious\r\ncharacter would be a most unfortunate complication.\"\r\n\r\nCaulfield Gardens was one of those lines of flat-faced pillared, and\r\nporticoed houses which are so prominent a product of the middle\r\nVictorian epoch in the West End of London.  Next door there appeared to\r\nbe a children's party, for the merry buzz of young voices and the\r\nclatter of a piano resounded through the night.  The fog still hung\r\nabout and screened us with its friendly shade.  Holmes had lit his\r\nlantern and flashed it upon the massive door.\r\n\r\n\"This is a serious proposition,\" said he.  \"It is certainly bolted as\r\nwell as locked.  We would do better in the area.  There is an excellent\r\narchway down yonder in case a too zealous policeman should intrude.\r\nGive me a hand, Watson, and I'll do the same for you.\"\r\n\r\nA minute later we were both in the area.  Hardly had we reached the\r\ndark shadows before the step of the policeman was heard in the fog\r\nabove.  As its soft rhythm died away, Holmes set to work upon the lower\r\ndoor.  I saw him stoop and strain until with a sharp crash it flew\r\nopen.  We sprang through into the dark passage, closing the area door\r\nbehind us.  Holmes led the way up the curving, uncarpeted stair.  His\r\nlittle fan of yellow light shone upon a low window.\r\n\r\n\"Here we are, Watson--this must be the one.\"  He threw it open, and as\r\nhe did so there was a low, harsh murmur, growing steadily into a loud\r\nroar as a train dashed past us in the darkness. Holmes swept his light\r\nalong the window-sill.  It was thickly coated with soot from the\r\npassing engines, but the black surface was blurred and rubbed in places.\r\n\r\n\"You can see where they rested the body.  Halloa, Watson! what is this?\r\nThere can be no doubt that it is a blood mark.\"  He was pointing to\r\nfaint discolourations along the woodwork of the window.  \"Here it is on\r\nthe stone of the stair also.  The demonstration is complete.  Let us\r\nstay here until a train stops.\"\r\n\r\nWe had not long to wait.  The very next train roared from the tunnel as\r\nbefore, but slowed in the open, and then, with a creaking of brakes,\r\npulled up immediately beneath us.  It was not four feet from the\r\nwindow-ledge to the roof of the carriages. Holmes softly closed the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\"So far we are justified,\" said he.  \"What do you think of it, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"A masterpiece.  You have never risen to a greater height.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot agree with you there.  From the moment that I conceived the\r\nidea of the body being upon the roof, which surely was not a very\r\nabstruse one, all the rest was inevitable.  If it were not for the\r\ngrave interests involved the affair up to this point would be\r\ninsignificant.  Our difficulties are still before us. But perhaps we\r\nmay find something here which may help us.\"\r\n\r\nWe had ascended the kitchen stair and entered the suite of rooms upon\r\nthe first floor.  One was a dining-room, severely furnished and\r\ncontaining nothing of interest.  A second was a bedroom, which also\r\ndrew blank.  The remaining room appeared more promising, and my\r\ncompanion settled down to a systematic examination.  It was littered\r\nwith books and papers, and was evidently used as a study.  Swiftly and\r\nmethodically Holmes turned over the contents of drawer after drawer and\r\ncupboard after cupboard, but no gleam of success came to brighten his\r\naustere face.  At the end of an hour he was no further than when he\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\n\"The cunning dog has covered his tracks,\" said he.  \"He has left\r\nnothing to incriminate him.  His dangerous correspondence has been\r\ndestroyed or removed.  This is our last chance.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a small tin cash-box which stood upon the writing-desk. Holmes\r\npried it open with his chisel.  Several rolls of paper were within,\r\ncovered with figures and calculations, without any note to show to what\r\nthey referred.  The recurring words, \"water pressure\" and \"pressure to\r\nthe square inch\" suggested some possible relation to a submarine.\r\nHolmes tossed them all impatiently aside.  There only remained an\r\nenvelope with some small newspaper slips inside it.  He shook them out\r\non the table, and at once I saw by his eager face that his hopes had\r\nbeen raised.\r\n\r\n\"What's this, Watson?  Eh?  What's this?  Record of a series of\r\nmessages in the advertisements of a paper.  Daily Telegraph agony\r\ncolumn by the print and paper.  Right-hand top corner of a page. No\r\ndates--but messages arrange themselves.  This must be the first:\r\n\r\n\"Hoped to hear sooner.  Terms agreed to.  Write fully to address given\r\non card.\r\n\r\n\"Pierrot.\r\n\r\n\"Next comes:\r\n\r\n\"Too complex for description.  Must have full report, Stuff awaits you\r\nwhen goods delivered.\r\n\r\n\"Pierrot.\r\n\r\n\"Then comes:\r\n\r\n\"Matter presses.  Must withdraw offer unless contract completed. Make\r\nappointment by letter. Will confirm by advertisement.\r\n\r\n\"Pierrot.\r\n\r\n\"Finally:\r\n\r\n\"Monday night after nine.  Two taps.  Only ourselves.  Do not be so\r\nsuspicious.  Payment in hard cash when goods delivered.\r\n\r\n\"Pierrot.\r\n\r\n\"A fairly complete record, Watson!  If we could only get at the man at\r\nthe other end!\"  He sat lost in thought, tapping his fingers on the\r\ntable.  Finally he sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps it won't be so difficult, after all.  There is nothing\r\nmore to be done here, Watson.  I think we might drive round to the\r\noffices of the Daily Telegraph, and so bring a good day's work to a\r\nconclusion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMycroft Holmes and Lestrade had come round by appointment after\r\nbreakfast next day and Sherlock Holmes had recounted to them our\r\nproceedings of the day before.  The professional shook his head over\r\nour confessed burglary.\r\n\r\n\"We can't do these things in the force, Mr. Holmes,\" said he. \"No\r\nwonder you get results that are beyond us.  But some of these days\r\nyou'll go too far, and you'll find yourself and your friend in trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"For England, home and beauty--eh, Watson?  Martyrs on the altar of our\r\ncountry.  But what do you think of it, Mycroft?\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent, Sherlock!  Admirable!  But what use will you make of it?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes picked up the Daily Telegraph which lay upon the table.\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen Pierrot's advertisement to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?  Another one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, here it is:\r\n\r\n\"To-night.  Same hour.  Same place.  Two taps.  Most vitally important.\r\nYour own safety at stake.\r\n\r\n\"Pierrot.\r\n\r\n\"By George!\" cried Lestrade.  \"If he answers that we've got him!\"\r\n\r\n\"That was my idea when I put it in.  I think if you could both make it\r\nconvenient to come with us about eight o'clock to Caulfield Gardens we\r\nmight possibly get a little nearer to a solution.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable characteristics of Sherlock Holmes was his\r\npower of throwing his brain out of action and switching all his\r\nthoughts on to lighter things whenever he had convinced himself that he\r\ncould no longer work to advantage.  I remember that during the whole of\r\nthat memorable day he lost himself in a monograph which he had\r\nundertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus.  For my own part I had\r\nnone of this power of detachment, and the day, in consequence, appeared\r\nto be interminable.  The great national importance of the issue, the\r\nsuspense in high quarters, the direct nature of the experiment which we\r\nwere trying--all combined to work upon my nerve.  It was a relief to me\r\nwhen at last, after a light dinner, we set out upon our expedition.\r\nLestrade and Mycroft met us by appointment at the outside of Gloucester\r\nRoad Station.  The area door of Oberstein's house had been left open\r\nthe night before, and it was necessary for me, as Mycroft Holmes\r\nabsolutely and indignantly declined to climb the railings, to pass in\r\nand open the hall door.  By nine o'clock we were all seated in the\r\nstudy, waiting patiently for our man.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed and yet another.  When eleven struck, the measured beat\r\nof the great church clock seemed to sound the dirge of our hopes.\r\nLestrade and Mycroft were fidgeting in their seats and looking twice a\r\nminute at their watches.  Holmes sat silent and composed, his eyelids\r\nhalf shut, but every sense on the alert. He raised his head with a\r\nsudden jerk.\r\n\r\n\"He is coming,\" said he.\r\n\r\nThere had been a furtive step past the door.  Now it returned. We heard\r\na shuffling sound outside, and then two sharp taps with the knocker.\r\nHolmes rose, motioning us to remain seated.  The gas in the hall was a\r\nmere point of light.  He opened the outer door, and then as a dark\r\nfigure slipped past him he closed and fastened it.  \"This way!\" we\r\nheard him say, and a moment later our man stood before us.  Holmes had\r\nfollowed him closely, and as the man turned with a cry of surprise and\r\nalarm he caught him by the collar and threw him back into the room.\r\nBefore our prisoner had recovered his balance the door was shut and\r\nHolmes standing with his back against it.  The man glared round him,\r\nstaggered, and fell senseless upon the floor.  With the shock, his\r\nbroad-brimmed hat flew from his head, his cravat slipped down from his\r\nlips, and there were the long light beard and the soft, handsome\r\ndelicate features of Colonel Valentine Walter.\r\n\r\nHolmes gave a whistle of surprise.\r\n\r\n\"You can write me down an ass this time, Watson,\" said he.  \"This was\r\nnot the bird that I was looking for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is he?\" asked Mycroft eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"The younger brother of the late Sir James Walter, the head of the\r\nSubmarine Department.  Yes, yes; I see the fall of the cards. He is\r\ncoming to.  I think that you had best leave his examination to me.\"\r\n\r\nWe had carried the prostrate body to the sofa.  Now our prisoner sat\r\nup, looked round him with a horror-stricken face, and passed his hand\r\nover his forehead, like one who cannot believe his own senses.\r\n\r\n\"What is this?\" he asked.  \"I came here to visit Mr. Oberstein.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything is known, Colonel Walter,\" said Holmes.  \"How an English\r\ngentleman could behave in such a manner is beyond my comprehension.\r\nBut your whole correspondence and relations with Oberstein are within\r\nour knowledge.  So also are the circumstances connected with the death\r\nof young Cadogan West. Let me advise you to gain at least the small\r\ncredit for repentance and confession, since there are still some\r\ndetails which we can only learn from your lips.\"\r\n\r\nThe man groaned and sank his face in his hands.  We waited, but he was\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n\"I can assure you,\" said Holmes, \"that every essential is already\r\nknown.  We know that you were pressed for money; that you took an\r\nimpress of the keys which your brother held; and that you entered into\r\na correspondence with Oberstein, who answered your letters through the\r\nadvertisement columns of the Daily Telegraph.  We are aware that you\r\nwent down to the office in the fog on Monday night, but that you were\r\nseen and followed by young Cadogan West, who had probably some previous\r\nreason to suspect you.  He saw your theft, but could not give the\r\nalarm, as it was just possible that you were taking the papers to your\r\nbrother in London. Leaving all his private concerns, like the good\r\ncitizen that he was, he followed you closely in the fog and kept at\r\nyour heels until you reached this very house.  There he intervened, and\r\nthen it was, Colonel Walter, that to treason you added the more\r\nterrible crime of murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not!  I did not!  Before God I swear that I did not!\" cried our\r\nwretched prisoner.\r\n\r\n\"Tell us, then, how Cadogan West met his end before you laid him upon\r\nthe roof of a railway carriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will.  I swear to you that I will.  I did the rest.  I confess it.\r\nIt was just as you say.  A Stock Exchange debt had to be paid.  I\r\nneeded the money badly.  Oberstein offered me five thousand.  It was to\r\nsave myself from ruin.  But as to murder, I am as innocent as you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"He had his suspicions before, and he followed me as you describe.  I\r\nnever knew it until I was at the very door.  It was thick fog, and one\r\ncould not see three yards.  I had given two taps and Oberstein had come\r\nto the door.  The young man rushed up and demanded to know what we were\r\nabout to do with the papers. Oberstein had a short life-preserver.  He\r\nalways carried it with him.  As West forced his way after us into the\r\nhouse Oberstein struck him on the head.  The blow was a fatal one.  He\r\nwas dead within five minutes.  There he lay in the hall, and we were at\r\nour wit's end what to do.  Then Oberstein had this idea about the\r\ntrains which halted under his back window.  But first he examined the\r\npapers which I had brought.  He said that three of them were essential,\r\nand that he must keep them.  'You cannot keep them,' said I.  'There\r\nwill be a dreadful row at Woolwich if they are not returned.'  'I must\r\nkeep them,' said he, 'for they are so technical that it is impossible\r\nin the time to make copies.' 'Then they must all go back together\r\nto-night,' said I.  He thought for a little, and then he cried out that\r\nhe had it. 'Three I will keep,' said he.  'The others we will stuff\r\ninto the pocket of this young man.  When he is found the whole business\r\nwill assuredly be put to his account.'  I could see no other way out of\r\nit, so we did as he suggested.  We waited half an hour at the window\r\nbefore a train stopped.  It was so thick that nothing could be seen,\r\nand we had no difficulty in lowering West's body on to the train.  That\r\nwas the end of the matter so far as I was concerned.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your brother?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said nothing, but he had caught me once with his keys, and I think\r\nthat he suspected.  I read in his eyes that he suspected. As you know,\r\nhe never held up his head again.\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence in the room.  It was broken by Mycroft Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Can you not make reparation?  It would ease your conscience, and\r\npossibly your punishment.\"\r\n\r\n\"What reparation can I make?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is Oberstein with the papers?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he give you no address?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said that letters to the Hotel du Louvre, Paris, would eventually\r\nreach him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then reparation is still within your power,\" said Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"I will do anything I can.  I owe this fellow no particular good-will.\r\nHe has been my ruin and my downfall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here are paper and pen.  Sit at this desk and write to my dictation.\r\nDirect the envelope to the address given.  That is right.  Now the\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:\r\n\r\n\"With regard to our transaction, you will no doubt have observed by now\r\nthat one essential detail is missing.  I have a tracing which will make\r\nit complete.  This has involved me in extra trouble, however, and I\r\nmust ask you for a further advance of five hundred pounds.  I will not\r\ntrust it to the post, nor will I take anything but gold or notes.  I\r\nwould come to you abroad, but it would excite remark if I left the\r\ncountry at present. Therefore I shall expect to meet you in the\r\nsmoking-room of the Charing Cross Hotel at noon on Saturday.  Remember\r\nthat only English notes, or gold, will be taken.\r\n\r\n\"That will do very well.  I shall be very much surprised if it does not\r\nfetch our man.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it did!  It is a matter of history--that secret history of a nation\r\nwhich is often so much more intimate and interesting than its public\r\nchronicles--that Oberstein, eager to complete the coup of his lifetime,\r\ncame to the lure and was safely engulfed for fifteen years in a British\r\nprison.  In his trunk were found the invaluable Bruce-Partington plans,\r\nwhich he had put up for auction in all the naval centres of Europe.\r\n\r\nColonel Walter died in prison towards the end of the second year of his\r\nsentence.  As to Holmes, he returned refreshed to his monograph upon\r\nthe Polyphonic Motets of Lassus, which has since been printed for\r\nprivate circulation, and is said by experts to be the last word upon\r\nthe subject.  Some weeks afterwards I learned incidentally that my\r\nfriend spent a day at Windsor, whence he returned with a remarkably\r\nfine emerald tie-pin.  When I asked him if he had bought it, he\r\nanswered that it was a present from a certain gracious lady in whose\r\ninterests he had once been fortunate enough to carry out a small\r\ncommission.  He said no more; but I fancy that I could guess at that\r\nlady's august name, and I have little doubt that the emerald pin will\r\nforever recall to my friend's memory the adventure of the\r\nBruce-Partington plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            ","LETTERS OF TWO BRIDES\n\nBy Honore de Balzac\n\nTranslated by R. S. Scott\n\n\n\n\nDEDICATION\n\n  To George Sand\n\n  Your name, dear George, while casting a reflected radiance on my\n  book, can gain no new glory from this page. And yet it is neither\n  self-interest nor diffidence which has led me to place it there,\n  but only the wish that it should bear witness to the solid\n  friendship between us, which has survived our wanderings and\n  separations, and triumphed over the busy malice of the world. This\n  feeling is hardly likely now to change. The goodly company of\n  friendly names, which will remain attached to my works, forms an\n  element of pleasure in the midst of the vexation caused by their\n  increasing number. Each fresh book, in fact, gives rise to fresh\n  annoyance, were it only in the reproaches aimed at my too prolific\n  pen, as though it could rival in fertility the world from which I\n  draw my models! Would it not be a fine thing, George, if the\n  future antiquarian of dead literatures were to find in this\n  company none but great names and generous hearts, friends bound by\n  pure and holy ties, the illustrious figures of the century? May I\n  not justly pride myself on this assured possession, rather than on\n  a popularity necessarily unstable? For him who knows you well, it\n  is happiness to be able to sign himself, as I do here,\n\n  Your friend,\n  DE BALZAC.\n\n  PARIS, June 1840.\n\n\n\n\n\nLETTERS OF TWO BRIDES\n\n\n\n\nFIRST PART\n\n\n\n\nI. LOUISE DE CHAULIEU TO RENEE DE MAUCOMBE. PARIS, September.\n\nSweetheart, I too am free! And I am the first too, unless you have\nwritten to Blois, at our sweet tryst of letter-writing.\n\nRaise those great black eyes of yours, fixed on my opening sentence,\nand keep this excitement for the letter which shall tell you of my first\nlove. By the way, why always \"first?\" Is there, I wonder, a second love?\n\nDon't go running on like this, you will say, but tell me rather how\nyou made your escape from the convent where you were to take your vows.\nWell, dear, I don't know about the Carmelites, but the miracle of my own\ndeliverance was, I can assure you, most humdrum. The cries of an alarmed\nconscience triumphed over the dictates of a stern policy--there's the\nwhole mystery. The sombre melancholy which seized me after you left\nhastened the happy climax, my aunt did not want to see me die of a\ndecline, and my mother, whose one unfailing cure for my malady was a\nnovitiate, gave way before her.\n\nSo I am in Paris, thanks to you, my love! Dear Renee, could you have\nseen me the day I found myself parted from you, well might you have\ngloried in the deep impression you had made on so youthful a bosom. We\nhad lived so constantly together, sharing our dreams and letting our\nfancy roam together, that I verily believe our souls had become welded\ntogether, like those two Hungarian girls, whose death we heard about\nfrom M. Beauvisage--poor misnamed being! Never surely was man better cut\nout by nature for the post of convent physician!\n\nTell me, did you not droop and sicken with your darling?\n\nIn my gloomy depression, I could do nothing but count over the ties\nwhich bind us. But it seemed as though distance had loosened them; I\nwearied of life, like a turtle-dove widowed of her mate. Death smiled\nsweetly on me, and I was proceeding quietly to die. To be at Blois, at\nthe Carmelites, consumed by dread of having to take my vows there, a\nMlle. de la Valliere, but without her prelude, and without my Renee! How\ncould I not be sick--sick unto death?\n\nHow different it used to be! That monotonous existence, where every hour\nbrings its duty, its prayer, its task, with such desperate regularity\nthat you can tell what a Carmelite sister is doing in any place, at any\nhour of the night or day; that deadly dull routine, which crushes out\nall interest in one's surroundings, had become for us two a world of\nlife and movement. Imagination had thrown open her fairy realms, and in\nthese our spirits ranged at will, each in turn serving as magic steed\nto the other, the more alert quickening the drowsy; the world from\nwhich our bodies were shut out became the playground of our fancy, which\nreveled there in frolicsome adventure. The very _Lives of the Saints_\nhelped us to understand what was so carefully left unsaid! But the day\nwhen I was reft of your sweet company, I became a true Carmelite, such\nas they appeared to us, a modern Danaid, who, instead of trying to fill\na bottomless barrel, draws every day, from Heaven knows what deep, an\nempty pitcher, thinking to find it full.\n\nMy aunt knew nothing of this inner life. How could she, who has made a\nparadise for herself within the two acres of her convent, understand my\nrevolt against life? A religious life, if embraced by girls of our age,\ndemands either an extreme simplicity of soul, such as we, sweetheart, do\nnot possess, or else an ardor for self-sacrifice like that which makes\nmy aunt so noble a character. But she sacrificed herself for a brother\nto whom she was devoted; to do the same for an unknown person or an idea\nis surely more than can be asked of mortals.\n\nFor the last fortnight I have been gulping down so many reckless words,\nburying so many reflections in my bosom, and accumulating such a store\nof things to tell, fit for your ear alone, that I should certainly\nhave been suffocated but for the resource of letter-writing as a sorry\nsubstitute for our beloved talks. How hungry one's heart gets! I am\nbeginning my journal this morning, and I picture to myself that yours\nis already started, and that, in a few days, I shall be at home in your\nbeautiful Gemenos valley, which I know only through your descriptions,\njust as you will live that Paris life, revealed to you hitherto only in\nour dreams.\n\nWell, then, sweet child, know that on a certain morning--a red-letter\nday in my life--there arrived from Paris a lady companion and Philippe,\nthe last remaining of my grandmother's valets, charged to carry me off.\nWhen my aunt summoned me to her room and told me the news, I could not\nspeak for joy, and only gazed at her stupidly.\n\n\"My child,\" she said, in her guttural voice, \"I can see that you leave\nme without regret, but this farewell is not the last; we shall meet\nagain. God has placed on your forehead the sign of the elect. You have\nthe pride which leads to heaven or to hell, but your nature is too noble\nto choose the downward path. I know you better than you know yourself;\nwith you, passion, I can see, will be very different from what it is\nwith most women.\"\n\nShe drew me gently to her and kissed my forehead. The kiss made my flesh\ncreep, for it burned with that consuming fire which eats away her life,\nwhich has turned to black the azure of her eyes, and softened the lines\nabout them, has furrowed the warm ivory of her temples, and cast a\nsallow tinge over the beautiful face.\n\nBefore replying, I kissed her hands.\n\n\"Dear aunt,\" I said, \"I shall never forget your kindness; and if it has\nnot made your nunnery all that it ought to be for my health of body and\nsoul, you may be sure nothing short of a broken heart will bring me\nback again--and that you would not wish for me. You will not see me\nhere again till my royal lover has deserted me, and I warn you that if I\ncatch him, death alone shall tear him from me. I fear no Montespan.\"\n\nShe smiled and said:\n\n\"Go, madcap, and take your idle fancies with you. There is certainly\nmore of the bold Montespan in you than of the gentle la Valliere.\"\n\nI threw my arms round her. The poor lady could not refrain from\nescorting me to the carriage. There her tender gaze was divided between\nme and the armorial bearings.\n\nAt Beaugency night overtook me, still sunk in a stupor of the mind\nproduced by these strange parting words. What can be awaiting me in this\nworld for which I have so hungered?\n\nTo begin with, I found no one to receive me; my heart had been schooled\nin vain. My mother was at the Bois de Boulogne, my father at the\nCouncil; my brother, the Duc de Rhetore, never comes in, I am told,\ntill it is time to dress for dinner. Miss Griffith (she is not unlike a\ngriffin) and Philippe took me to my rooms.\n\nThe suite is the one which belonged to my beloved grandmother, the\nPrincess de Vauremont, to whom I owe some sort of a fortune which no\none has ever told me about. As you read this, you will understand\nthe sadness which came over me as I entered a place sacred to so many\nmemories, and found the rooms just as she had left them! I was to sleep\nin the bed where she died.\n\nSitting down on the edge of the sofa, I burst into tears, forgetting I\nwas not alone, and remembering only how often I had stood there by her\nknees, the better to hear her words. There I had gazed upon her face,\nburied in its brown laces, and worn as much by age as by the pangs of\napproaching death. The room seemed to me still warm with the heat which\nshe kept up there. How comes it that Armande-Louise-Marie de Chaulieu\nmust be like some peasant girl, who sleeps in her mother's bed the very\nmorrow of her death? For to me it was as though the Princess, who died\nin 1817, had passed away but yesterday.\n\nI saw many things in the room which ought to have been removed. Their\npresence showed the carelessness with which people, busy with the\naffairs of state, may treat their own, and also the little thought which\nhad been given since her death to this grand old lady, who will always\nremain one of the striking figures of the eighteenth century. Philippe\nseemed to divine something of the cause of my tears. He told me that the\nfurniture of the Princess had been left to me in her will and that my\nfather had allowed all the larger suites to remain dismantled, as the\nRevolution had left them. On hearing this I rose, and Philippe opened\nthe door of the small drawing-room which leads into the reception-rooms.\n\nIn these I found all the well-remembered wreckage; the panels above\nthe doors, which had contained valuable pictures, bare of all but empty\nframes; broken marbles, mirrors carried off. In old days I was afraid\nto go up the state staircase and cross these vast, deserted rooms; so I\nused to get to the Princess' rooms by a small staircase which runs\nunder the arch of the larger one and leads to the secret door of her\ndressing-room.\n\nMy suite, consisting of a drawing-room, bedroom, and the pretty\nmorning-room in scarlet and gold, of which I have told you, lies in the\nwing on the side of the Invalides. The house is only separated from the\nboulevard by a wall, covered with creepers, and by a splendid avenue\nof trees, which mingle their foliage with that of the young elms on\nthe sidewalk of the boulevard. But for the blue-and-gold dome of the\nInvalides and its gray stone mass, you might be in a wood.\n\nThe style of decoration in these rooms, together with their situation,\nindicates that they were the old show suite of the duchesses, while\nthe dukes must have had theirs in the wing opposite. The two suites are\ndecorously separated by the two main blocks, as well as by the central\none, which contained those vast, gloomy, resounding halls shown me\nby Philippe, all despoiled of their splendor, as in the days of my\nchildhood.\n\nPhilippe grew quite confidential when he saw the surprise depicted on my\ncountenance. For you must know that in this home of diplomacy the very\nservants have a reserved and mysterious air. He went on to tell me that\nit was expected a law would soon be passed restoring to the fugitives\nof the Revolution the value of their property, and that my father is\nwaiting to do up his house till this restitution is made, the king's\narchitect having estimated the damage at three hundred thousand livres.\n\nThis piece of news flung me back despairing on my drawing-room sofa.\nCould it be that my father, instead of spending this money in arranging\na marriage for me, would have left me to die in the convent? This was\nthe first thought to greet me on the threshold of my home.\n\nAh! Renee, what would I have given then to rest my head upon your\nshoulder, or to transport myself to the days when my grandmother made\nthe life of these rooms? You two in all the world have been alone in\nloving me--you away at Maucombe, and she who survives only in my heart,\nthe dear old lady, whose still youthful eyes used to open from sleep at\nmy call. How well we understood each other!\n\nThese memories suddenly changed my mood. What at first had seemed\nprofanation, now breathed of holy association. It was sweet to inhale\nthe faint odor of the powder she loved still lingering in the room;\nsweet to sleep beneath the shelter of those yellow damask curtains with\ntheir white pattern, which must have retained something of the spirit\nemanating from her eyes and breath. I told Philippe to rub up the old\nfurniture and make the rooms look as if they were lived in; I explained\nto him myself how I wanted everything arranged, and where to put each\npiece of furniture. In this way I entered into possession, and showed\nhow an air of youth might be given to the dear old things.\n\nThe bedroom is white in color, a little dulled with time, just as the\ngilding of the fanciful arabesques shows here and there a patch of red;\nbut this effect harmonizes well with the faded colors of the Savonnerie\ntapestry, which was presented to my grandmother by Louis XV. along with\nhis portrait. The timepiece was a gift from the Marechal de Saxe,\nand the china ornaments on the mantelpiece came from the Marechal de\nRichelieu. My grandmother's portrait, painted at the age of twenty-five,\nhangs in an oval frame opposite that of the King. The Prince, her\nhusband, is conspicuous by his absence. I like this frank negligence,\nuntinged by hypocrisy--a characteristic touch which sums up her charming\npersonality. Once when my grandmother was seriously ill, her confessor\nwas urgent that the Prince, who was waiting in the drawing-room, should\nbe admitted.\n\n\"He can come in with the doctor and his drugs,\" was the reply.\n\nThe bed has a canopy and well-stuffed back, and the curtains are looped\nup with fine wide bands. The furniture is of gilded wood, upholstered in\nthe same yellow damask with white flowers which drapes the windows,\nand which is lined there with a white silk that looks as though it were\nwatered. The panels over the doors have been painted, by what artist\nI can't say, but they represent one a sunrise, the other a moonlight\nscene.\n\nThe fireplace is a very interesting feature in the room. It is easy to\nsee that life in the last century centered largely round the hearth,\nwhere great events were enacted. The copper gilt grate is a marvel\nof workmanship, and the mantelpiece is most delicately finished; the\nfire-irons are beautifully chased; the bellows are a perfect gem.\nThe tapestry of the screen comes from the Gobelins and is exquisitely\nmounted; charming fantastic figures run all over the frame, on the feet,\nthe supporting bar, and the wings; the whole thing is wrought like a\nfan.\n\nDearly should I like to know who was the giver of this dainty work of\nart, which was such a favorite with her. How often have I seen the old\nlady, her feet upon the bar, reclining in the easy-chair, with her dress\nhalf raised in front, toying with the snuff-box, which lay upon the\nledge between her box of pastilles and her silk mits. What a coquette\nshe was! to the day of her death she took as much pains with her\nappearance as though the beautiful portrait had been painted only\nyesterday, and she were waiting to receive the throng of exquisites from\nthe Court! How the armchair recalls to me the inimitable sweep of her\nskirts as she sank back in it!\n\nThese women of a past generation have carried off with them secrets\nwhich are very typical of their age. The Princess had a certain turn\nof the head, a way of dropping her glance and her remarks, a choice of\nwords, which I look for in vain, even in my mother. There was subtlety\nin it all, and there was good-nature; the points were made without any\naffectation. Her talk was at once lengthy and concise; she told a good\nstory, and could put her meaning in three words. Above all, she was\nextremely free-thinking, and this has undoubtedly had its effect on my\nway of looking at things.\n\nFrom seven years old till I was ten, I never left her side; it pleased\nher to attract me as much as it pleased me to go. This preference was\nthe cause of more than one passage at arms between her and my mother,\nand nothing intensifies feeling like the icy breath of persecution. How\ncharming was her greeting, \"Here you are, little rogue!\" when curiosity\nhad taught me how to glide with stealthy snake-like movements to her\nroom. She felt that I loved her, and this childish affection was welcome\nas a ray of sunshine in the winter of her life.\n\nI don't know what went on in her rooms at night, but she had many\nvisitors; and when I came on tiptoe in the morning to see if she\nwere awake, I would find the drawing-room furniture disarranged, the\ncard-tables set out, and patches of snuff scattered about.\n\nThis drawing-room is furnished in the same style as the bedroom. The\nchairs and tables are oddly shaped, with claw feet and hollow mouldings.\nRich garlands of flowers, beautifully designed and carved, wind over the\nmirrors and hang down in festoons. On the consoles are fine china\nvases. The ground colors are scarlet and white. My grandmother was a\nhigh-spirited, striking brunette, as might be inferred from her choice\nof colors. I have found in the drawing-room a writing-table I remember\nwell; the figures on it used to fascinate me; it is plaited in graven\nsilver, and was a present from one of the Genoese Lomellini. Each side\nof the table represents the occupations of a different season; there are\nhundreds of figures in each picture, and all in relief.\n\nI remained alone for two hours, while old memories rose before me,\none after another, on this spot, hallowed by the death of a woman most\nremarkable even among the witty and beautiful Court ladies of Louis\nXV.'s day.\n\nYou know how abruptly I was parted from her, at a day's notice, in 1816.\n\n\"Go and bid good-bye to your grandmother,\" said my mother.\n\nThe Princess received me as usual, without any display of feeling, and\nexpressed no surprise at my departure.\n\n\"You are going to the convent, dear,\" she said, \"and will see your aunt\nthere, who is an excellent woman. I shall take care, though, that they\ndon't make a victim of you; you shall be independent, and able to marry\nwhom you please.\"\n\nSix months later she died. Her will had been given into the keeping of\nthe Prince de Talleyrand, the most devoted of all her old friends. He\ncontrived, while paying a visit to Mlle. de Chargeboeuf, to intimate\nto me, through her, that my grandmother forbade me to take the vows. I\nhope, sooner or later, to meet the Prince, and then I shall doubtless\nlearn more from him.\n\nThus, sweetheart, if I have found no one in flesh and blood to meet me,\nI have comforted myself with the shade of the dear Princess, and have\nprepared myself for carrying out one of our pledges, which was, as you\nknow, to keep each other informed of the smallest details in our homes\nand occupations. It makes such a difference to know where and how the\nlife of one we love is passed. Send me a faithful picture of the veriest\ntrifles around you, omitting nothing, not even the sunset lights among\nthe tall trees.\n\nOctober 19th.\n\nIt was three in the afternoon when I arrived. About half-past five, Rose\ncame and told me that my mother had returned, so I went downstairs to\npay my respects to her.\n\nMy mother lives in a suite on the ground floor, exactly corresponding\nto mine, and in the same block. I am just over her head, and the same\nsecret staircase serves for both. My father's rooms are in the block\nopposite, but are larger by the whole of the space occupied by the grand\nstaircase on our side of the building. These ancestral mansions are so\nspacious, that my father and mother continue to occupy the ground-floor\nrooms, in spite of the social duties which have once more devolved on\nthem with the return of the Bourbons, and are even able to receive in\nthem.\n\nI found my mother, dressed for the evening, in her drawing-room, where\nnothing is changed. I came slowly down the stairs, speculating with\nevery step how I should be met by this mother who had shown herself so\nlittle of a mother to me, and from whom, during eight years, I had heard\nnothing beyond the two letters of which you know. Judging it unworthy to\nsimulate an affection I could not possibly feel, I put on the air of\na pious imbecile, and entered the room with many inward qualms, which\nhowever soon disappeared. My mother's tack was equal to the occasion.\nShe made no pretence of emotion; she neither held me at arm's-length nor\nhugged me to her bosom like a beloved daughter, but greeted me as though\nwe had parted the evening before. Her manner was that of the kindliest\nand most sincere friend, as she addressed me like a grown person, first\nkissing me on the forehead.\n\n\"My dear little one,\" she said, \"if you were to die at the convent, it\nis much better to live with your family. You frustrate your father's\nplans and mine; but the age of blind obedience to parents is past. M. de\nChaulieu's intention, and in this I am quite at one with him, is to lose\nno opportunity of making your life pleasant and of letting you see the\nworld. At your age I should have thought as you do, therefore I am not\nvexed with you; it is impossible you should understand what we expected\nfrom you. You will not find any absurd severity in me; and if you have\never thought me heartless, you will soon find out your mistake. Still,\nthough I wish you to feel perfectly free, I think that, to begin with,\nyou would do well to follow the counsels of a mother, who wishes to be a\nsister to you.\"\n\nI was quite charmed by the Duchess, who talked in a gentle voice,\nstraightening my convent tippet as she spoke. At the age of thirty-eight\nshe is still exquisitely beautiful. She has dark-blue eyes, with silken\nlashes, a smooth forehead, and a complexion so pink and white that you\nmight think she paints. Her bust and shoulders are marvelous, and her\nwaist is as slender as yours. Her hand is milk-white and extraordinarily\nbeautiful; the nails catch the light in their perfect polish, the thumb\nis like ivory, the little finger stands just a little apart from the\nrest, and the foot matches the hand; it is the Spanish foot of Mlle. de\nVandenesse. If she is like this at forty, at sixty she will still be a\nbeautiful woman.\n\nI replied, sweetheart, like a good little girl. I was as nice to her as\nshe to me, nay, nicer. Her beauty completely vanquished me; it seemed\nonly natural that such a woman should be absorbed in her regal part. I\ntold her this as simply as though I had been talking to you. I daresay\nit was a surprise to her to hear words of affection from her daughter's\nmouth, and the unfeigned homage of my admiration evidently touched her\ndeeply. Her manner changed and became even more engaging; she dropped\nall formality as she said:\n\n\"I am much pleased with you, and I hope we shall remain good friends.\"\n\nThe words struck me as charmingly naive, but I did not let this appear,\nfor I saw at once that the prudent course was to allow her to believe\nherself much deeper and cleverer than her daughter. So I only stared\nvacantly and she was delighted. I kissed her hands repeatedly, telling\nher how happy it made me to be so treated and to feel at my ease with\nher. I even confided to her my previous tremors. She smiled, put her\narm round my neck, and drawing me towards her, kissed me on the forehead\nmost affectionately.\n\n\"Dear child,\" she said, \"we have people coming to dinner to-day. Perhaps\nyou will agree with me that it is better for you not to make your first\nappearance in society till you have been in the dressmaker's hands; so,\nafter you have seen your father and brother, you can go upstairs again.\"\n\nI assented most heartily. My mother's exquisite dress was the first\nrevelation to me of the world which our dreams had pictured; but I did\nnot feel the slightest desire to rival her.\n\nMy father now entered, and the Duchess presented me to him.\n\nHe became all at once most affectionate, and played the father's part so\nwell, that I could not but believe his heart to be in it. Taking my two\nhands in his, and kissing them, with more of the lover than the father\nin his manner, he said:\n\n\"So this is my rebel daughter!\"\n\nAnd he drew me towards him, with his arm passed tenderly round my waist,\nwhile he kissed me on the cheeks and forehead.\n\n\"The pleasure with which we shall watch your success in society will\natone for the disappointment we felt at your change of vocation,\" he\nsaid. Then, turning to my mother, \"Do you know that she is going to turn\nout very pretty, and you will be proud of her some day?--Here is your\nbrother, Rhetore.--Alphonse,\" he said to a fine young man who came in,\n\"here is your convent-bred sister, who threatens to send her nun's frock\nto the deuce.\"\n\nMy brother came up in a leisurely way and took my hand, which he\npressed.\n\n\"Come, come, you may kiss her,\" said my father.\n\nAnd he kissed me on both cheeks.\n\n\"I am delighted to see you,\" he said, \"and I take your side against my\nfather.\"\n\nI thanked him, but could not help thinking he might have come to Blois\nwhen he was at Orleans visiting our Marquis brother in his quarters.\n\nFearing the arrival of strangers, I now withdrew. I tidied up my rooms,\nand laid out on the scarlet velvet of my lovely table all the materials\nnecessary for writing to you, meditating all the while on my new\nsituation.\n\nThis, my fair sweetheart, is a true and veracious account of the return\nof a girl of eighteen, after an absence of nine years, to the bosom of\none of the noblest families in the kingdom. I was tired by the journey\nas well as by all the emotions I had been through, so I went to bed in\nconvent fashion, at eight o'clock after supper. They have preserved even\na little Saxe service which the dear Princess used when she had a fancy\nfor taking her meals alone.\n\n\n\n\nII. THE SAME TO THE SAME November 25th.\n\nNext day I found my rooms done out and dusted, and even flowers put\nin the vases, by old Philippe. I began to feel at home. Only it didn't\noccur to anybody that a Carmelite schoolgirl has an early appetite, and\nRose had no end of trouble in getting breakfast for me.\n\n\"Mlle. goes to bed at dinner-time,\" she said to me, \"and gets up when\nthe Duke is just returning home.\"\n\nI began to write. About one o'clock my father knocked at the door of the\nsmall drawing-room and asked if he might come in. I opened the door; he\ncame in, and found me writing to you.\n\n\"My dear,\" he began, \"you will have to get yourself clothes, and to make\nthese rooms comfortable. In this purse you will find twelve thousand\nfrancs, which is the yearly income I purpose allowing you for your\nexpenses. You will make arrangements with your mother as to some\ngoverness whom you may like, in case Miss Griffith doesn't please\nyou, for Mme. de Chaulieu will not have time to go out with you in the\nmornings. A carriage and man-servant shall be at your disposal.\"\n\n\"Let me keep Philippe,\" I said.\n\n\"So be it,\" he replied. \"But don't be uneasy; you have money enough of\nyour own to be no burden either to your mother or me.\"\n\n\"May I ask how much I have?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my child,\" he said. \"Your grandmother left you five hundred\nthousand francs; this was the amount of her savings, for she would not\nalienate a foot of land from the family. This sum has been placed in\nGovernment stock, and, with the accumulated interest, now brings in\nabout forty thousand francs a year. With this I had purposed making an\nindependence for your second brother, and it is here that you have upset\nmy plans. Later, however, it is possible that you may fall in with them.\nIt shall rest with yourself, for I have confidence in your good sense\nfar more than I had expected.\n\n\"I do not need to tell you how a daughter of the Chaulieus ought\nto behave. The pride so plainly written in your features is my best\nguarantee. Safeguards, such as common folk surround their daughters\nwith, would be an insult in our family. A slander reflecting on your\nname might cost the life of the man bold enough to utter it, or the life\nof one of your brothers, if by chance the right should not prevail. No\nmore on this subject. Good-bye, little one.\"\n\nHe kissed me on the forehead and went out. I cannot understand the\nrelinquishment of this plan after nine years' persistence in it. My\nfather's frankness is what I like. There is no ambiguity about his\nwords. My money ought to belong to his Marquis son. Who, then, has had\nbowels of mercy? My mother? My father? Or could it be my brother?\n\nI remained sitting on my grandmother's sofa, staring at the purse which\nmy father had left on the mantelpiece, at once pleased and vexed that\nI could not withdraw my mind from the money. It is true, further\nspeculation was useless. My doubts had been cleared up and there was\nsomething fine in the way my pride was spared.\n\nPhilippe has spent the morning rushing about among the various shops and\nworkpeople who are to undertake the task of my metamorphosis. A\nfamous dressmaker, by name Victorine, has come, as well as a woman for\nunderclothing, and a shoemaker. I am as impatient as a child to know\nwhat I shall be like when I emerge from the sack which constituted the\nconventual uniform; but all these tradespeople take a long time; the\ncorset-maker requires a whole week if my figure is not to be spoilt. You\nsee, I have a figure, dear; this becomes serious. Janssen, the Operatic\nshoemaker, solemnly assures me that I have my mother's foot. The whole\nmorning has gone in these weighty occupations. Even a glovemaker has\ncome to take the measure of my hand. The underclothing woman has got my\norders.\n\nAt the meal which I call dinner, and the others lunch, my mother told me\nthat we were going together to the milliner's to see some hats, so that\nmy taste should be formed, and I might be in a position to order my own.\n\nThis burst of independence dazzles me. I am like a blind man who has\njust recovered his sight. Now I begin to understand the vast interval\nwhich separates a Carmelite sister from a girl in society. Of ourselves\nwe could never have conceived it.\n\nDuring this lunch my father seemed absent-minded, and we left him to his\nthoughts; he is deep in the King's confidence. I was entirely forgotten;\nbut, from what I have seen, I have no doubt he will remember me when he\nhas need of me. He is a very attractive man in spite of his fifty years.\nHis figure is youthful; he is well made, fair, and extremely graceful\nin his movements. He has a diplomatic face, at once dumb and expressive;\nhis nose is long and slender, and he has brown eyes.\n\nWhat a handsome pair! Strange thoughts assail me as it becomes plain\nto me that these two, so perfectly matched in birth, wealth, and mental\nsuperiority, live entirely apart, and have nothing in common but their\nname. The show of unity is only for the world.\n\nThe cream of the Court and diplomatic circles were here last night. Very\nsoon I am going to a ball given by the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse, and\nI shall be presented to the society I am so eager to know. A\ndancing-master is coming every morning to give me lessons, for I must be\nable to dance in a month, or I can't go to the ball.\n\nBefore dinner, my mother came to talk about the governess with me. I\nhave decided to keep Miss Griffith, who was recommended by the English\nambassador. Miss Griffith is the daughter of a clergyman; her mother was\nof good family, and she is perfectly well bred. She is thirty-six, and\nwill teach me English. The good soul is quite handsome enough to have\nambitions; she is Scotch--poor and proud--and will act as my chaperon.\nShe is to sleep in Rose's room. Rose will be under her orders. I saw at\na glance that my governess would be governed by me. In the six days we\nhave been together, she has made very sure that I am the only\nperson likely to take an interest in her; while, for my part, I have\nascertained that, for all her statuesque features, she will prove\naccommodating. She seems to me a kindly soul, but cautious. I have not\nbeen able to extract a word of what passed between her and my mother.\n\nAnother trifling piece of news! My father has this morning refused the\nappointment as Minister of State which was offered him. This accounts\nfor his preoccupied manner last night. He says he would prefer an\nembassy to the worries of public debate. Spain in especial attracts him.\n\nThis news was told me at lunch, the one moment of the day when my\nfather, mother, and brother see each other in an easy way. The servants\nthen only come when they are rung for. The rest of the day my brother,\nas well as my father, spends out of the house. My mother has her toilet\nto make; between two and four she is never visible; at four o'clock she\ngoes out for an hour's drive; when she is not dining out, she receives\nfrom six to seven, and the evening is given to entertainments of various\nkinds--theatres, balls, concerts, at homes. In short, her life is so\nfull, that I don't believe she ever has a quarter of an hour to herself.\nShe must spend a considerable time dressing in the morning; for at\nlunch, which takes place between eleven and twelve, she is exquisite.\nThe meaning of the things that are said about her is dawning on me. She\nbegins the day with a bath barely warmed, and a cup of cold coffee with\ncream; then she dresses. She is never, except on some great emergency,\ncalled before nine o'clock. In summer there are morning rides, and at\ntwo o'clock she receives a young man whom I have never yet contrived to\nsee.\n\nBehold our family life! We meet at lunch and dinner, though often I\nam alone with my mother at this latter meal, and I foresee that still\noftener I shall take it in my own rooms (following the example of\nmy grandmother) with only Miss Griffith for company, for my mother\nfrequently dines out. I have ceased to wonder at the indifference my\nfamily have shown to me. In Paris, my dear, it is a miracle of virtue to\nlove the people who live with you, for you see little enough of them; as\nfor the absent--they do not exist!\n\nKnowing as this may sound, I have not yet set foot in the streets, and\nam deplorably ignorant. I must wait till I am less of the country cousin\nand have brought my dress and deportment into keeping with the society\nI am about to enter, the whirl of which amazes me even here, where only\ndistant murmurs reach my ear. So far I have not gone beyond the garden;\nbut the Italian opera opens in a few days, and my mother has a box\nthere. I am crazy with delight at the thought of hearing Italian music\nand seeing French acting.\n\nAlready I begin to drop convent habits for those of society. I spend the\nevening writing to you till the moment for going to bed arrives. This\nhas been postponed to ten o'clock, the hour at which my mother goes out,\nif she is not at the theatre. There are twelve theatres in Paris.\n\nI am grossly ignorant and I read a lot, but quite indiscriminately, one\nbook leading to another. I find the names of fresh books on the cover of\nthe one I am reading; but as I have no one to direct me, I light on some\nwhich are fearfully dull. What modern literature I have read all turns\nupon love, the subject which used to bulk so largely in our thoughts,\nbecause it seemed that our fate was determined by man and for man. But\nhow inferior are these authors to two little girls, known as Sweetheart\nand Darling--otherwise Renee and Louise. Ah! my love, what wretched\nplots, what ridiculous situations, and what poverty of sentiment!\nTwo books, however, have given me wonderful pleasure--_Corinne_ and\n_Adolphe_. Apropos of this, I asked my father one day whether it would\nbe possible for me to see Mme. de Stael. My father, mother, and Alphonse\nall burst out laughing, and Alphonse said:\n\n\"Where in the world has she sprung from?\"\n\nTo which my father replied:\n\n\"What fools we are! She springs from the Carmelites.\"\n\n\"My child, Mme. de Stael is dead,\" said my mother gently.\n\nWhen I finished _Adolphe_, I asked Miss Griffith how a woman could be\nbetrayed.\n\n\"Why, of course, when she loves,\" was her reply.\n\nRenee, tell me, do you think we could be betrayed by a man?\n\nMiss Griffith has at last discerned that I am not an utter ignoramus,\nthat I have somewhere a hidden vein of knowledge, the knowledge we\nlearned from each other in our random arguments. She sees that it is\nonly superficial facts of which I am ignorant. The poor thing has opened\nher heart to me. Her curt reply to my question, when I compare it with\nall the sorrows I can imagine, makes me feel quite creepy. Once more she\nurged me not to be dazzled by the glitter of society, to be always on my\nguard, especially against what most attracted me. This is the sum-total\nof her wisdom, and I can get nothing more out of her. Her lectures,\ntherefore, become a trifle monotonous, and she might be compared in this\nrespect to the bird which has only one cry.\n\n\n\n\nIII. THE SAME TO THE SAME December.\n\nMy Darling,--Here I am ready to make my bow to the world. By way of\npreparation I have been trying to commit all the follies I could think\nof before sobering down for my entry. This morning, I have seen myself,\nafter many rehearsals, well and duly equipped--stays, shoes, curls,\ndress, ornaments,--all in order. Following the example of duelists\nbefore a meeting, I tried my arms in the privacy of my chamber. I wanted\nto see how I would look, and had no difficulty in discovering a certain\nair of victory and triumph, bound to carry all before it. I mustered all\nmy forces, in accordance with that splendid maxim of antiquity,\n\"Know thyself!\" and boundless was my delight in thus making my own\nacquaintance. Griffith was the sole spectator of this doll's play,\nin which I was at once doll and child. You think you know me? You are\nhugely mistaken.\n\nHere is a portrait, then, Renee, of your sister, formerly disguised as a\nCarmelite, now brought to life again as a frivolous society girl. She is\none of the greatest beauties in France--Provence, of course, excepted.\nI don't see that I can give a more accurate summary of this interesting\ntopic.\n\nTrue, I have my weak points; but were I a man, I should adore them. They\narise from what is most promising in me. When you have spent a fortnight\nadmiring the exquisite curves of your mother's arms, and that mother the\nDuchesse de Chaulieu, it is impossible, my dear, not to deplore your own\nangular elbows. Yet there is consolation in observing the fineness of\nthe wrist, and a certain grace of line in those hollows, which will yet\nfill out and show plump, round, and well modeled, under the satiny skin.\nThe somewhat crude outline of the arms is seen again in the shoulders.\nStrictly speaking, indeed, I have no shoulders, but only two bony\nblades, standing out in harsh relief. My figure also lacks pliancy;\nthere is a stiffness about the side lines.\n\nPoof! There's the worst out. But then the contours are bold and\ndelicate, the bright, pure flame of health bites into the vigorous\nlines, a flood of life and of blue blood pulses under the transparent\nskin, and the fairest daughter of Eve would seem a Negress beside me! I\nhave the foot of a gazelle! My joints are finely turned, my features\nof a Greek correctness. It is true, madame, that the flesh tints do not\nmelt into each other; but, at least, they stand out clear and bright. In\nshort, I am a very pretty green fruit, with all the charm of unripeness.\nI see a great likeness to the face in my aunt's old missal, which rises\nout of a violet lily.\n\nThere is no silly weakness in the blue of my insolent eyes; the white\nis pure mother-of-pearl, prettily marked with tiny veins, and the thick,\nlong lashes fall like a silken fringe. My forehead sparkles, and the\nhair grows deliciously; it ripples into waves of pale gold, growing\nbrowner towards the centre, whence escape little rebel locks, which\nalone would tell that my fairness is not of the insipid and hysterical\ntype. I am a tropical blonde, with plenty of blood in my veins, a\nblonde more apt to strike than to turn the cheek. What do you think the\nhairdresser proposed? He wanted, if you please, to smooth my hair into\ntwo bands, and place over my forehead a pearl, kept in place by a gold\nchain! He said it would recall the Middle Ages.\n\nI told him I was not aged enough to have reached the middle, or to need\nan ornament to freshen me up!\n\nThe nose is slender, and the well-cut nostrils are separated by a\nsweet little pink partition--an imperious, mocking nose, with a tip\ntoo sensitive ever to grow fat or red. Sweetheart, if this won't find\na husband for a dowerless maiden, I'm a donkey. The ears are daintily\ncurled, a pearl hanging from either lobe would show yellow. The neck\nis long, and has an undulating motion full of dignity. In the shade the\nwhite ripens to a golden tinge. Perhaps the mouth is a little large. But\nhow expressive! what a color on the lips! how prettily the teeth laugh!\n\nThen, dear, there is a harmony running through all. What a gait! what\na voice! We have not forgotten how our grandmother's skirts fell into\nplace without a touch. In a word, I am lovely and charming. When the\nmood comes, I can laugh one of our good old laughs, and no one will\nthink the less of me; the dimples, impressed by Comedy's light fingers\non my fair cheeks, will command respect. Or I can let my eyes fall\nand my heart freeze under my snowy brows. I can pose as a Madonna with\nmelancholy, swan-like neck, and the painters' virgins will be nowhere;\nmy place in heaven would be far above them. A man would be forced to\nchant when he spoke to me.\n\nSo, you see, my panoply is complete, and I can run the whole gamut of\ncoquetry from deepest bass to shrillest treble. It is a huge advantage\nnot to be all of one piece. Now, my mother is neither playful nor\nvirginal. Her only attitude is an imposing one; when she ceases to be\nmajestic, she is ferocious. It is difficult for her to heal the wounds\nshe makes, whereas I can wound and heal together. We are absolutely\nunlike, and therefore there could not possibly be rivalry between us,\nunless indeed we quarreled over the greater or less perfection of our\nextremities, which are similar. I take after my father, who is shrewd\nand subtle. I have the manner of my grandmother and her charming voice,\nwhich becomes falsetto when forced, but is a sweet-toned chest voice at\nthe ordinary pitch of a quiet talk.\n\nI feel as if I had left the convent to-day for the first time. For\nsociety I do not yet exist; I am unknown to it. What a ravishing moment!\nI still belong only to myself, like a flower just blown, unseen yet of\nmortal eye.\n\nIn spite of this, my sweet, as I paced the drawing-room during my\nself-inspection, and saw the poor cast-off school-clothes, a queer\nfeeling came over me. Regret for the past, anxiety about the future,\nfear of society, a long farewell to the pale daisies which we used to\npick and strip of their petals in light-hearted innocence, there was\nsomething of all that; but strange, fantastic visions also rose, which I\ncrushed back into the inner depths, whence they had sprung, and whither\nI dared not follow them.\n\nMy Renee, I have a regular trousseau! It is all beautifully laid away\nand perfumed in the cedar-wood drawers with lacquered front of my\ncharming dressing-table. There are ribbons, shoes, gloves, all in lavish\nabundance. My father has kindly presented me with the pretty gewgaws a\ngirl loves--a dressing-case, toilet service, scent-box, fan, sunshade,\nprayer-book, gold chain, cashmere shawl. He has also promised to give\nme riding lessons. And I can dance! To-morrow, yes, to-morrow evening, I\ncome out!\n\nMy dress is white muslin, and on my head I wear a garland of white\nroses in Greek style. I shall put on my Madonna face; I mean to play the\nsimpleton, and have all the women on my side. My mother is miles away\nfrom any idea of what I write to you. She believes me quite destitute of\nmind, and would be dumfounded if she read my letter. My brother honors\nme with a profound contempt, and is uniformly and politely indifferent.\n\nHe is a handsome young fellow, but melancholy, and given to moods. I\nhave divined his secret, though neither the Duke nor Duchess has an\ninkling of it. In spite of his youth and his title, he is jealous of his\nfather. He has no position in the State, no post at Court, he never has\nto say, \"I am going to the Chamber.\" I alone in the house have sixteen\nhours for meditation. My father is absorbed in public business and his\nown amusements; my mother, too, is never at leisure; no member of the\nhousehold practises self-examination, they are constantly in company,\nand have hardly time to live.\n\nI should immensely like to know what is the potent charm wielded by\nsociety to keep people prisoner from nine every evening till two or\nthree in the morning, and force them to be so lavish alike of strength\nand money. When I longed for it, I had no idea of the separations it\nbrought about, or its overmastering spell. But, then, I forget, it is\nParis which does it all.\n\nIt is possible, it seems, for members of one family to live side by side\nand know absolutely nothing of each other. A half-fledged nun arrives,\nand in a couple of weeks has grasped domestic details, of which the\nmaster diplomatist at the head of the house is quite ignorant. Or\nperhaps he _does_ see, and shuts his eyes deliberately, as part of the\nfather's _role_. There is a mystery here which I must plumb.\n\n\n\n\nIV. THE SAME TO THE SAME December 15th.\n\nYesterday, at two o'clock, I went to drive in the Champs-Elysees and the\nBois de Boulogne. It was one of those autumn days which we used to find\nso beautiful on the banks of the Loire. So I have seen Paris at last!\nThe Place Louis XV. is certainly very fine, but the beauty is that of\nman's handiwork.\n\nI was dressed to perfection, pensive, with set face (though inwardly\nmuch tempted to laugh), under a lovely hat, my arms crossed. Would you\nbelieve it? Not a single smile was thrown at me, not one poor youth was\nstruck motionless as I passed, not a soul turned to look again; and yet\nthe carriage proceeded with a deliberation worthy of my pose.\n\nNo, I am wrong, there was one--a duke, and a charming man--who suddenly\nreined in as we went by. The individual who thus saved appearances for\nme was my father, and he proclaimed himself highly gratified by what he\nsaw. I met my mother also, who sent me a butterfly kiss from the tips\nof her fingers. The worthy Griffith, who fears no man, cast her glances\nhither and thither without discrimination. In my judgment, a young woman\nshould always know exactly what her eye is resting on.\n\nI was mad with rage. One man actually inspected my carriage without\nnoticing me. This flattering homage probably came from a carriage-maker.\nI have been quite out in the reckoning of my forces. Plainly, beauty,\nthat rare gift which comes from heaven, is commoner in Paris than I\nthought. I saw hats doffed with deference to simpering fools; a purple\nface called forth murmurs of, \"It is she!\" My mother received an immense\namount of admiration. There is an answer to this problem, and I mean to\nfind it.\n\nThe men, my dear, seemed to me generally very ugly. The very few\nexceptions are bad copies of us. Heaven knows what evil genius has\ninspired their costume; it is amazingly inelegant compared with those\nof former generations. It has no distinction, no beauty of color or\nromance; it appeals neither to the senses, nor the mind, nor the eye,\nand it must be very uncomfortable. It is meagre and stunted. The hat,\nabove all, struck me; it is a sort of truncated column, and does not\nadapt itself in the least to the shape of the head; but I am told it\nis easier to bring about a revolution than to invent a graceful hat.\nCourage in Paris recoils before the thought of appearing in a round\nfelt; and for lack of one day's daring, men stick all their lives to\nthis ridiculous headpiece. And yet Frenchmen are said to be fickle!\n\nThe men are hideous anyway, whatever they put on their heads. I have\nseen nothing but worn, hard faces, with no calm nor peace in the\nexpression; the harsh lines and furrows speak of foiled ambition and\nsmarting vanity. A fine forehead is rarely seen.\n\n\"And these are the product of Paris!\" I said to Miss Griffith.\n\n\"Most cultivated and pleasant men,\" she replied.\n\nI was silent. The heart of a spinster of thirty-six is a well of\ntolerance.\n\nIn the evening I went to the ball, where I kept close to my mother's\nside. She gave me her arm with a devotion which did not miss its\nreward. All the honors were for her; I was made the pretext for charming\ncompliments. She was clever enough to find me fools for my partners, who\none and all expatiated on the heat and the beauty of the ball, till you\nmight suppose I was freezing and blind. Not one failed to enlarge on the\nstrange, unheard-of, extraordinary, odd, remarkable fact--that he saw me\nfor the first time.\n\nMy dress, which dazzled me as I paraded alone in my white-and-gold\ndrawing-room, was barely noticeable amidst the gorgeous finery of most\nof the married women. Each had her band of faithful followers, and they\nall watched each other askance. A few were radiant in triumphant\nbeauty, and amongst these was my mother. A girl at a ball is a mere\ndancing-machine--a thing of no consequence whatever.\n\nThe men, with rare exceptions, did not impress me more favorably here\nthan at the Champs-Elysees. They have a used-up look; their features\nare meaningless, or rather they have all the same meaning. The proud,\nstalwart bearing which we find in the portraits of our ancestors--men\nwho joined moral to physical vigor--has disappeared. Yet in this\ngathering there was one man of remarkable ability, who stood out from\nthe rest by the beauty of his face. But even he did not rouse in me the\nfeeling which I should have expected. I do not know his works, and he is\na man of no family. Whatever the genius and the merits of a plebeian\nor a commoner, he could never stir my blood. Besides, this man was\nobviously so much more taken up with himself than with anybody else,\nthat I could not but think these great brain-workers must look on us as\nthings rather than persons. When men of intellectual power love, they\nought to give up writing, otherwise their love is not the real thing.\nThe lady of their heart does not come first in all their thoughts. I\nseemed to read all this in the bearing of the man I speak of. I am told\nhe is a professor, orator, and author, whose ambition makes him the\nslave of every bigwig.\n\nMy mind was made up on the spot. It was unworthy of me, I determined,\nto quarrel with society for not being impressed by my merits, and I gave\nmyself up to the simple pleasure of dancing, which I thoroughly enjoyed.\nI heard a great deal of inept gossip about people of whom I know\nnothing; but perhaps it is my ignorance on many subjects which prevents\nme from appreciating it, as I saw that most men and women took a lively\npleasure in certain remarks, whether falling from their own lips or\nthose of others. Society bristles with enigmas which look hard to solve.\nIt is a perfect maze of intrigue. Yet I am fairly quick of sight and\nhearing, and as to my wits, Mlle. de Maucombe does not need to be told!\n\nI returned home tired with a pleasant sort of tiredness, and in all\ninnocence began describing my sensations to my mother, who was with me.\nShe checked me with the warning that I must never say such things to any\none but her.\n\n\"My dear child,\" she added, \"it needs as much tact to know when to be\nsilent as when to speak.\"\n\nThis advice brought home to me the nature of the sensations which ought\nto be concealed from every one, not excepting perhaps even a mother. At\na glance I measured the vast field of feminine duplicity. I can assure\nyou, sweetheart, that we, in our unabashed simplicity, would pass for\ntwo very wide-awake little scandal-mongers. What lessons may be conveyed\nin a finger on the lips, in a word, a look! All in a moment I was seized\nwith excessive shyness. What! may I never again speak of the natural\npleasure I feel in the exercise of dancing? \"How then,\" I said to\nmyself, \"about the deeper feelings?\"\n\nI went to bed sorrowful, and I still suffer from the shock produced by\nthis first collision of my frank, joyous nature with the harsh laws\nof society. Already the highway hedges are flecked with my white wool!\nFarewell, beloved.\n\n\n\n\nV. RENEE DE MAUCOMBE TO LOUISE DE CHAULIEU October.\n\nHow deeply your letter moved me; above all, when I compare our widely\ndifferent destinies! How brilliant is the world you are entering, how\npeaceful the retreat where I shall end my modest career!\n\nIn the Castle of Maucombe, which is so well known to you by description\nthat I shall say no more of it, I found my room almost exactly as I\nleft it; only now I can enjoy the splendid view it gives of the Gemenos\nvalley, which my childish eyes used to see without comprehending. A\nfortnight after my arrival, my father and mother took me, along with my\ntwo brothers, to dine with one of our neighbors, M. de l'Estorade,\nan old gentleman of good family, who has made himself rich, after the\nprovincial fashion, by scraping and paring.\n\nM. de l'Estorade was unable to save his only son from the clutches of\nBonaparte; after successfully eluding the conscription, he was forced\nto send him to the army in 1813, to join the Emperor's bodyguard. After\nLeipsic no more was heard of him. M. de Montriveau, whom the father\ninterviewed in 1814, declared that he had seen him taken by the\nRussians. Mme. de l'Estorade died of grief whilst a vain search was\nbeing made in Russia. The Baron, a very pious old man, practised that\nfine theological virtue which we used to cultivate at Blois--Hope!\nHope made him see his son in dreams. He hoarded his income for him, and\nguarded carefully the portion of inheritance which fell to him from the\nfamily of the late Mme. de l'Estorade, no one venturing to ridicule the\nold man.\n\nAt last it dawned upon me that the unexpected return of this son was the\ncause of my own. Who could have imagined, whilst fancy was leading us\na giddy dance, that my destined husband was slowly traveling on foot\nthrough Russia, Poland, and Germany? His bad luck only forsook him\nat Berlin, where the French Minister helped his return to his native\ncountry. M. de l'Estorade, the father, who is a small landed proprietor\nin Provence, with an income of about ten thousand livres, has not\nsufficient European fame to interest the world in the wandering Knight\nde l'Estorade, whose name smacks of his adventures.\n\nThe accumulated income of twelve thousand livres from the property of\nMme. de l'Estorade, with the addition of the father's savings, provides\nthe poor guard of honor with something like two hundred and fifty\nthousand livres, not counting house and lands--quite a considerable\nfortune in Provence. His worthy father had bought, on the very eve\nof the Chevalier's return, a fine but badly-managed estate, where he\ndesigns to plant ten thousand mulberry-trees, raised in his nursery\nwith a special view to this acquisition. The Baron, having found his\nlong-lost son, has now but one thought, to marry him, and marry him to a\ngirl of good family.\n\nMy father and mother entered into their neighbor's idea with an eye to\nmy interests so soon as they discovered that Renee de Maucombe would be\nacceptable without a dowry, and that the money the said Renee ought\nto inherit from her parents would be duly acknowledged as hers in the\ncontract. In a similar way, my younger brother, Jean de Maucombe, as\nsoon as he came of age, signed a document stating that he had received\nfrom his parents an advance upon the estate equal in amount to one-third\nof whole. This is the device by which the nobles of Provence elude the\ninfamous Civil Code of M. de Bonaparte, a code which will drive as many\ngirls of good family into convents as it will find husbands for. The\nFrench nobility, from the little I have been able to gather, seem to be\ndivided on these matters.\n\nThe dinner, darling, was a first meeting between your sweetheart and the\nexile. The Comte de Maucombe's servants donned their old laced\nliveries and hats, the coachman his great top-boots; we sat five in the\nantiquated carriage, and arrived in state about two o'clock--the dinner\nwas for three--at the grange, which is the dwelling of the Baron de\nl'Estorade.\n\nMy father-in-law to be has, you see, no castle, only a simple country\nhouse, standing beneath one of our hills, at the entrance of that noble\nvalley, the pride of which is undoubtedly the Castle of Maucombe.\nThe building is quite unpretentious: four pebble walls covered with a\nyellowish wash, and roofed with hollow tiles of a good red, constitute\nthe grange. The rafters bend under the weight of this brick-kiln.\nThe windows, inserted casually, without any attempt at symmetry, have\nenormous shutters, painted yellow. The garden in which it stands is a\nProvencal garden, enclosed by low walls, built of big round pebbles set\nin layers, alternately sloping or upright, according to the artistic\ntaste of the mason, which finds here its only outlet. The mud in which\nthey are set is falling away in places.\n\nThanks to an iron railing at the entrance facing the road, this simple\nfarm has a certain air of being a country-seat. The railing, long sought\nwith tears, is so emaciated that it recalled Sister Angelique to me.\nA flight of stone steps leads to the door, which is protected by a\npent-house roof, such as no peasant on the Loire would tolerate for his\ncoquettish white stone house, with its blue roof, glittering in the sun.\nThe garden and surrounding walks are horribly dusty, and the trees seem\nburnt up. It is easy to see that for years the Baron's life has been a\nmere rising up and going to bed again, day after day, without a thought\nbeyond that of piling up coppers. He eats the same food as his two\nservants, a Provencal lad and the old woman who used to wait on his\nwife. The rooms are scantily furnished.\n\nNevertheless, the house of l'Estorade had done its best; the cupboards\nhad been ransacked, and its last man beaten up for the dinner, which was\nserved to us on old silver dishes, blackened and battered. The exile, my\ndarling pet, is like the railing, emaciated! He is pale and silent, and\nbears traces of suffering. At thirty-seven he might be fifty. The once\nbeautiful ebon locks of youth are streaked with white like a lark's\nwing. His fine blue eyes are cavernous; he is a little deaf, which\nsuggests the Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance.\n\nSpite of all this, I have graciously consented to become Mme. de\nl'Estorade and to receive a dowry of two hundred and fifty thousand\nlivres, but only on the express condition of being allowed to work my\nwill upon the grange and make a park there. I have demanded from my\nfather, in set terms, a grant of water, which can be brought thither\nfrom Maucombe. In a month I shall be Mme. de l'Estorade; for, dear, I\nhave made a good impression. After the snows of Siberia a man is ready\nenough to see merit in those black eyes, which according to you, used to\nripen fruit with a look. Louis de l'Estorade seems well content to marry\nthe _fair Renee de Maucombe_--such is your friend's splendid title.\n\nWhilst you are preparing to reap the joys of that many-sided existence\nwhich awaits a young lady of the Chaulieu family, and to queen it in\nParis, your poor little sweetheart, Renee, that child of the desert,\nhas fallen from the empyrean, whither together we had soared, into\nthe vulgar realities of a life as homely as a daisy's. I have vowed to\nmyself to comfort this young man, who has never known youth, but passed\nstraight from his mother's arms to the embrace of war, and from the joys\nof his country home to the frosts and forced labor of Siberia.\n\nHumble country pleasures will enliven the monotony of my future. It\nshall be my ambition to enlarge the oasis round my house, and to give\nit the lordly shade of fine trees. My turf, though Provencal, shall be\nalways green. I shall carry my park up the hillside and plant on the\nhighest point some pretty kiosque, whence, perhaps, my eyes may catch\nthe shimmer of the Mediterranean. Orange and lemon trees, and all\nchoicest things that grow, shall embellish my retreat; and there will I\nbe a mother among my children. The poetry of Nature, which nothing can\ndestroy, shall hedge us round; and standing loyally at the post of\nduty, we need fear no danger. My religious feelings are shared by my\nfather-in-law and by the Chevalier.\n\nAh! darling, my life unrolls itself before my eyes like one of the great\nhighways of France, level and easy, shaded with evergreen trees. This\ncentury will not see another Bonaparte; and my children, if I have\nany, will not be rent from me. They will be mine to train and make men\nof--the joy of my life. If you also are true to your destiny, you\nwho ought to find your mate amongst the great ones of the earth, the\nchildren of your Renee will not lack a zealous protectress.\n\nFarewell, then, for me at least, to the romances and thrilling\nadventures in which we used ourselves to play the part of heroine. The\nwhole story of my life lies before me now; its great crises will be\nthe teething and nutrition of the young Masters de l'Estorade, and the\nmischief they do to my shrubs and me. To embroider their caps, to\nbe loved and admired by a sickly man at the mouth of the Gemenos\nvalley--there are my pleasures. Perhaps some day the country dame may go\nand spend a winter in Marseilles; but danger does not haunt the purlieus\nof a narrow provincial stage. There will be nothing to fear, not even an\nadmiration such as could only make a woman proud. We shall take a great\ndeal of interest in the silkworms for whose benefit our mulberry-leaves\nwill be sold! We shall know the strange vicissitudes of life in\nProvence, and the storms that may attack even a peaceful household.\nQuarrels will be impossible, for M. de l'Estorade has formally announced\nthat he will leave the reins in his wife's hands; and as I shall\ndo nothing to remind him of this wise resolve, it is likely he may\npersevere in it.\n\nYou, my dear Louise, will supply the romance of my life. So you must\nnarrate to me in full all your adventures, describe your balls and\nparties, tell me what you wear, what flowers crown your lovely golden\nlocks, and what are the words and manners of the men you meet. Your\nother self will be always there--listening, dancing, feeling her\nfinger-tips pressed--with you. If only I could have some fun in Paris\nnow and then, while you played the house-mother at La Crampade! such\nis the name of our grange. Poor M. de l'Estorade, who fancies he is\nmarrying one woman! Will he find out there are two?\n\nI am writing nonsense now, and as henceforth I can only be foolish by\nproxy, I had better stop. One kiss, then, on each cheek--my lips are\nstill virginal, he has only dared to take my hand. Oh! our deference and\npropriety are quite disquieting, I assure you. There, I am off again....\nGood-bye, dear.\n\n_P. S._--I have just opened your third letter. My dear, I have about one\nthousand livres to dispose of; spend them for me on pretty things, such\nas we can't find here, nor even at Marseilles. While speeding on your\nown business, give a thought to the recluse of La Crampade. Remember\nthat on neither side have the heads of the family any people of taste in\nParis to make their purchases. I shall reply to your letter later.\n\n\n\n\nVI. DON FELIPE HENAREZ TO DON FERNAND PARIS, September.\n\nThe address of this letter, my brother, will show you that the head of\nyour house is out of reach of danger. If the massacre of our ancestors\nin the Court of Lions made Spaniards and Christians of us against our\nwill, it left us a legacy of Arab cunning; and it may be that I owe my\nsafety to the blood of the Abencerrages still flowing in my veins.\n\nFear made Ferdinand's acting so good, that Valdez actually believed in\nhis protestations. But for me the poor Admiral would have been done\nfor. Nothing, it seems, will teach the Liberals what a king is. This\nparticular Bourbon has been long known to me; and the more His Majesty\nassured me of his protection, the stronger grew my suspicions. A true\nSpaniard has no need to repeat a promise. A flow of words is a sure sign\nof duplicity.\n\nValdez took ship on an English vessel. For myself, no sooner did I see\nthe cause of my beloved Spain wrecked in Andalusia, than I wrote to the\nsteward of my Sardinian estate to make arrangements for my escape. Some\nhardy coral fishers were despatched to wait for me at a point on the\ncoast; and when Ferdinand urged the French to secure my person, I was\nalready in my barony of Macumer, amidst brigands who defy all law and\nall avengers.\n\nThe last Hispano-Moorish family of Granada has found once more the\nshelter of an African desert, and even a Saracen horse, in an estate\nwhich comes to it from Saracens. How the eyes of these brigands--who but\nyesterday had dreaded my authority--sparkled with savage joy and\npride when they found they were protecting against the King of Spain's\nvendetta the Duc de Soria, their master and a Henarez--the first who had\ncome to visit them since the time when the island belonged to the Moors.\nMore than a score of rifles were ready to point at Ferdinand of Bourbon,\nson of a race which was still unknown when the Abencerrages arrived as\nconquerors on the banks of the Loire.\n\nMy idea had been to live on the income of these huge estates, which,\nunfortunately, we have so greatly neglected; but my stay there convinced\nme that this was impossible, and that Queverdo's reports were only too\ncorrect. The poor man had twenty-two lives at my disposal, and not\na single _real_; prairies of twenty thousand acres, and not a house;\nvirgin forests, and not a stick of furniture! A million piastres and\na resident master for half a century would be necessary to make these\nmagnificent lands pay. I must see to this.\n\nThe conquered have time during their flight to ponder their own case and\nthat of their vanquished party. At the spectacle of my noble country, a\ncorpse for monks to prey on, my eyes filled with tears; I read in it the\npresage of Spain's gloomy future.\n\nAt Marseilles I heard of Riego's end. Painfully did it come home to\nme that my life also would henceforth be a martyrdom, but a martyrdom\nprotracted and unnoticed. Is existence worthy the name, when a man can\nno longer die for his country or live for a woman? To love, to conquer,\nthis twofold form of the same thought, is the law graven on our sabres,\nemblazoned on the vaulted roofs of our palaces, ceaselessly whispered\nby the water, which rises and falls in our marble fountains. But in vain\ndoes it nerve my heart; the sabre is broken, the palace in ashes, the\nliving spring sucked up by the barren sand.\n\nHere, then, is my last will and testament.\n\nDon Fernand, you will understand now why I put a check upon your ardor\nand ordered you to remain faithful to the _rey netto_. As your brother\nand friend, I implore you to obey me; as your master, I command. You\nwill go to the King and will ask from him the grant of my dignities and\nproperty, my office and titles. He will perhaps hesitate, and may treat\nyou to some regal scowls; but you must tell him that you are loved by\nMarie Heredia, and that Marie can marry none but a Duc de Soria. This\nwill make the King radiant. It is the immense fortune of the Heredia\nfamily which alone has stood between him and the accomplishment of my\nruin. Your proposal will seem to him, therefore, to deprive me of a last\nresource, and he will gladly hand over to you my spoils.\n\nYou will then marry Marie. The secret of the mutual love against which\nyou fought was no secret to me, and I have prepared the old Count to see\nyou take my place. Marie and I were merely doing what was expected of us\nin our position and carrying out the wishes of our fathers; everything\nelse is in your favor. You are beautiful as a child of love, and are\npossessed of Marie's heart. I am an ill-favored Spanish grandee, for\nwhom she feels an aversion to which she will not confess. Some slight\nreluctance there may be on the part of the noble Spanish girl on account\nof my misfortunes, but this you will soon overcome.\n\nDuc de Soria, your predecessor would neither cost you a regret nor rob\nyou of a maravedi. My mother's diamonds, which will suffice to make me\nindependent, I will keep, because the gap caused by them in the family\nestate can be filled by Marie's jewels. You can send them, therefore, by\nmy nurse, old Urraca, the only one of my servants whom I wish to retain.\nNo one can prepare my chocolate as she does.\n\nDuring our brief revolution, my life of unremitting toil was reduced to\nthe barest necessaries, and these my salary was sufficient to provide.\nYou will therefore find the income of the last two years in the hands of\nyour steward. This sum is mine; but a Duc de Soria cannot marry without\na large expenditure of money, therefore we will divide it. You will not\nrefuse this wedding-present from your brigand brother. Besides, I mean\nto have it so.\n\nThe barony of Macumer, not being Spanish territory, remains to me. Thus\nI have still a country and a name, should I wish to take up a position\nin the world again.\n\nThank Heaven, this finishes our business, and the house of Soria is\nsaved!\n\nAt the very moment when I drop into simple Baron de Macumer, the French\ncannon announce the arrival of the Duc d'Angouleme. You will understand\nwhy I break off....\n\nOctober.\n\nWhen I arrived here I had not ten doubloons in my pocket. He would\nindeed be a poor sort of leader who, in the midst of calamities he has\nnot been able to avert, has found means to feather his own nest. For the\nvanquished Moor there remains a horse and the desert; for the Christian\nfoiled of his hopes, the cloister and a few gold pieces.\n\nBut my present resignation is mere weariness. I am not yet so near the\nmonastery as to have abandoned all thoughts of life. Ozalga had given me\nseveral letters of introduction to meet all emergencies, amongst these\none to a bookseller, who takes with our fellow-countrymen the place\nwhich Galignani holds with the English in Paris. This man has found\neight pupils for me at three francs a lesson. I go to my pupils every\nalternate day, so that I have four lessons a day and earn twelve francs,\nwhich is more than I require. When Urraca comes I shall make some\nSpanish exile happy by passing on to him my connection.\n\nI lodge in the Rue Hillerin-Bertin with a poor widow, who takes\nboarders. My room faces south and looks out on a little garden. It is\nperfectly quiet; I have green trees to look upon, and spend the sum\nof one piastre a day. I am amazed at the amount of calm, pure pleasure\nwhich I enjoy in this life, after the fashion of Dionysius at Corinth.\nFrom sunrise until ten o'clock I smoke and take my chocolate, sitting at\nmy window and contemplating two Spanish plants, a broom which rises out\nof a clump of jessamine--gold on a white ground, colors which must send\na thrill through any scion of the Moors. At ten o'clock I start for my\nlessons, which last till four, when I return for dinner. Afterwards I\nread and smoke till I go to bed.\n\nI can put up for a long time with a life like this, compounded of work\nand meditation, of solitude and society. Be happy, therefore, Fernand;\nmy abdication has brought no afterthoughts; I have no regrets like\nCharles V., no longing to try the game again like Napoleon. Five days\nand nights have passed since I wrote my will; to my mind they might have\nbeen five centuries. Honor, titles, wealth, are for me as though they\nhad never existed.\n\nNow that the conventional barrier of respect which hedged me round has\nfallen, I can open my heart to you, dear boy. Though cased in the armor\nof gravity, this heart is full of tenderness and devotion, which have\nfound no object, and which no woman has divined, not even she who, from\nher cradle, has been my destined bride. In this lies the secret of\nmy political enthusiasm. Spain has taken the place of a mistress and\nreceived the homage of my heart. And now Spain, too, is gone! Beggared\nof all, I can gaze upon the ruin of what once was me and speculate over\nthe mysteries of my being.\n\nWhy did life animate this carcass, and when will it depart? Why has that\nrace, pre-eminent in chivalry, breathed all its primitive virtues--its\ntropical love, its fiery poetry--into this its last offshoot, if the\nseed was never to burst its rugged shell, if no stem was to spring\nforth, no radiant flower scatter aloft its Eastern perfumes? Of what\ncrime have I been guilty before my birth that I can inspire no love? Did\nfate from my very infancy decree that I should be stranded, a useless\nhulk, on some barren shore! I find in my soul the image of the deserts\nwhere my fathers ranged, illumined by a scorching sun which shrivels up\nall life. Proud remnant of a fallen race, vain force, love run to waste,\nan old man in the prime of youth, here better than elsewhere shall I\nawait the last grace of death. Alas! under this murky sky no spark will\nkindle these ashes again to flame. Thus my last words may be those of\nChrist, _My God, Thou hast forsaken me!_ Cry of agony and terror, to the\ncore of which no mortal has ventured yet to penetrate!\n\nYou can realize now, Fernand, what a joy it is to me to live afresh in\nyou and Marie. I shall watch you henceforth with the pride of a creator\nsatisfied in his work. Love each other well and go on loving if you\nwould not give me pain; any discord between you would hurt me more than\nit would yourselves.\n\nOur mother had a presentiment that events would one day serve her\nwishes. It may be that the longing of a mother constitutes a pact\nbetween herself and God. Was she not, moreover, one of those mysterious\nbeings who can hold converse with Heaven and bring back thence a vision\nof the future? How often have I not read in the lines of her forehead\nthat she was coveting for Fernand the honors and the wealth of Felipe!\nWhen I said so to her, she would reply with tears, laying bare the\nwounds of a heart, which of right was the undivided property of both her\nsons, but which an irresistible passion gave to you alone.\n\nHer spirit, therefore, will hover joyfully above your heads as you bow\nthem at the altar. My mother, have you not a caress for your Felipe now\nthat he has yielded to your favorite even the girl whom you regretfully\nthrust into his arms? What I have done is pleasing to our womankind,\nto the dead, and to the King; it is the will of God. Make no difficulty\nthen, Fernand; obey, and be silent.\n\n_P. S._ Tell Urraca to be sure and call me nothing but M. Henarez. Don't\nsay a word about me to Marie. You must be the one living soul to know\nthe secrets of the last Christianized Moor, in whose veins runs the\nblood of a great family, which took its rise in the desert and is now\nabout to die out in the person of a solitary exile.\n\nFarewell.\n\n\n\n\nVII. LOUISE DE CHAULIEU TO RENEE DE MAUCOMBE\n\nWHAT! To be married so soon. But this is unheard of. At the end of a\nmonth you become engaged to a man who is a stranger to you, and about\nwhom you know nothing. The man may be deaf--there are so many kinds of\ndeafness!--he may be sickly, tiresome, insufferable!\n\nDon't you see, Renee, what they want with you? You are needful for\ncarrying on the glorious stock of the l'Estorades, that is all. You will\nbe buried in the provinces. Are these the promises we made each other?\nWere I you, I would sooner set off to the Hyeres islands in a caique,\non the chance of being captured by an Algerian corsair and sold to the\nGrand Turk. Then I should be a Sultana some day, and wouldn't I make a\nstir in the harem while I was young--yes, and afterwards too!\n\nYou are leaving one convent to enter another. I know you; you are a\ncoward, and you will submit to the yoke of family life with a lamblike\ndocility. But I am here to direct you; you must come to Paris. There\nwe shall drive the men wild and hold a court like queens. Your husband,\nsweetheart, in three years from now may become a member of the Chamber.\nI know all about members now, and I will explain it to you. You will\nwork that machine very well; you can live in Paris, and become there\nwhat my mother calls a woman of fashion. Oh! you needn't suppose I will\nleave you in your grange!\n\nMonday.\n\nFor a whole fortnight now, my dear, I have been living the life of\nsociety; one evening at the Italiens, another at the Grand Opera, and\nalways a ball afterwards. Ah! society is a witching world. The music of\nthe Opera enchants me; and whilst my soul is plunged in divine pleasure,\nI am the centre of admiration and the focus of all the opera-glasses.\nBut a single glance will make the boldest youth drop his eyes.\n\nI have seen some charming young men there; all the same, I don't care\nfor any of them; not one has roused in me the emotion which I feel when\nI listen to Garcia in his splendid duet with Pellegrini in _Otello_.\nHeavens! how jealous Rossini must have been to express jealousy so well!\nWhat a cry in \"Il mio cor si divide!\" I'm speaking Greek to you, for you\nnever heard Garcia, but then you know how jealous I am!\n\nWhat a wretched dramatist Shakespeare is! Othello is in love with glory;\nhe wins battles, he gives orders, he struts about and is all over the\nplace while Desdemona sits at home; and Desdemona, who sees herself\nneglected for the silly fuss of public life, is quite meek all the time.\nSuch a sheep deserves to be slaughtered. Let the man whom I deign to\nlove beware how he thinks of anything but loving me!\n\nFor my part, I like those long trials of the old-fashioned chivalry.\nThat lout of a young lord, who took offence because his sovereign-lady\nsent him down among the lions to fetch her glove, was, in my opinion,\nvery impertinent, and a fool too. Doubtless the lady had in reserve\nfor him some exquisite flower of love, which he lost, as he well\ndeserved--the puppy!\n\nBut here am I running on as though I had not a great piece of news to\ntell you. My father is certainly going to represent our master the King\nat Madrid. I say _our_ master, for I shall make part of the embassy. My\nmother wishes to remain here, and my father will take me so as to have\nsome woman with him.\n\nMy dear, this seems to you, no doubt, very simple, but there are horrors\nbehind it, all the same: in a fortnight I have probed the secrets of the\nhouse. My mother would accompany my father to Madrid if he would take\nM. de Canalis as a secretary to the embassy. But the King appoints\nthe secretaries; the Duke dare neither annoy the King, who hates to be\nopposed, nor vex my mother; and the wily diplomat believes he has cut\nthe knot by leaving the Duchess here. M. de Canalis, who is the great\npoet of the day, is the young man who cultivates my mother's society,\nand who no doubt studies diplomacy with her from three o'clock to five.\nDiplomacy must be a fine subject, for he is as regular as a gambler on\nthe Stock Exchange.\n\nThe Duc de Rhetore, our elder brother, solemn, cold, and whimsical,\nwould be extinguished by his father at Madrid, therefore he remains in\nParis. Miss Griffith has found out also that Alphonse is in love with a\nballet-girl at the Opera. How is it possible to fall in love with legs\nand pirouettes? We have noticed that my brother comes to the theatre\nonly when Tullia dances there; he applauds the steps of this creature,\nand then goes out. Two ballet-girls in a family are, I fancy, more\ndestructive than the plague. My second brother is with his regiment, and\nI have not yet seen him. Thus it comes about that I have to act as\nthe Antigone of His Majesty's ambassador. Perhaps I may get married in\nSpain, and perhaps my father's idea is a marriage there without dowry,\nafter the pattern of yours with this broken-down guard of honor. My\nfather asked if I would go with him, and offered me the use of his\nSpanish master.\n\n\"Spain, the country for castles in the air!\" I cried. \"Perhaps you hope\nthat it may mean marriages for me!\"\n\nFor sole reply he honored me with a meaning look. For some days he has\namused himself with teasing me at lunch; he watches me, and I dissemble.\nIn this way I have played with him cruelly as father and ambassador _in\npetto_. Hadn't he taken me for a fool? He asked me what I thought of\nthis and that young man, and of some girls whom I had met in several\nhouses. I replied with quite inane remarks on the color of their hair,\ntheir faces, and the difference in their figures. My father seemed\ndisappointed at my crassness, and inwardly blamed himself for having\nasked me.\n\n\"Still, father,\" I added, \"don't suppose I am saying what I really\nthink: mother made me afraid the other day that I had spoken more\nfrankly than I ought of my impressions.\"\n\n\"With your family you can speak quite freely,\" my mother replied.\n\n\"Very well, then,\" I went on. \"The young men I have met so far strike\nme as too self-centered to excite interest in others; they are much more\ntaken up with themselves than with their company. They can't be accused\nof lack of candor at any rate. They put on a certain expression to talk\nto us, and drop it again in a moment, apparently satisfied that we don't\nuse our eyes. The man as he converses is the lover; silent, he is the\nhusband. The girls, again, are so artificial that it is impossible to\nknow what they really are, except from the way they dance; their figures\nand movements alone are not a sham. But what has alarmed me most in this\nfashionable society is its brutality. The little incidents which take\nplace when supper is announced give one some idea--to compare small\nthings with great--of what a popular rising might be. Courtesy is only\na thin veneer on the general selfishness. I imagined society very\ndifferent. Women count for little in it; that may perhaps be a survival\nof Bonapartist ideas.\"\n\n\"Armande is coming on extraordinarily,\" said my mother.\n\n\"Mother, did you think I should never get beyond asking to see Mme. de\nStael?\"\n\nMy father smiled, and rose from the table.\n\nSaturday.\n\nMy dear, I have left one thing out. Here is the tidbit I have reserved\nfor you. The love which we pictured must be extremely well hidden; I\nhave seen not a trace of it. True, I have caught in drawing-rooms now\nand again a quick exchange of glances, but how colorless it all is!\nLove, as we imagined it, a world of wonders, of glorious dreams, of\ncharming realities, of sorrows that waken sympathy, and smiles that make\nsunshine, does not exist. The bewitching words, the constant interchange\nof happiness, the misery of absence, the flood of joy at the presence\nof the beloved one--where are they? What soil produces these radiant\nflowers of the soul? Which is wrong? We or the world?\n\nI have already seen hundreds of men, young and middle-aged; not one has\nstirred the least feeling in me. No proof of admiration and devotion on\ntheir part, not even a sword drawn in my behalf, would have moved me.\nLove, dear, is the product of such rare conditions that it is quite\npossible to live a lifetime without coming across the being on whom\nnature has bestowed the power of making one's happiness. The thought is\nenough to make one shudder; for if this being is found too late, what\nthen?\n\nFor some days I have begun to tremble when I think of the destiny of\nwomen, and to understand why so many wear a sad face beneath the flush\nbrought by the unnatural excitement of social dissipation. Marriage is\na mere matter of chance. Look at yours. A storm of wild thoughts\nhas passed over my mind. To be loved every day the same, yet with a\ndifference, to be loved as much after ten years of happiness as on the\nfirst day!--such a love demands years. The lover must be allowed to\nlanguish, curiosity must be piqued and satisfied, feeling roused and\nresponded to.\n\nIs there, then, a law for the inner fruits of the heart, as there is\nfor the visible fruits of nature? Can joy be made lasting? In what\nproportion should love mingle tears with pleasures? The cold policy of\nthe funereal, monotonous, persistent routine of the convent seemed to me\nat these moments the only real life; while the wealth, the splendor, the\ntears, the delights, the triumph, the joy, the satisfaction, of a love\nequal, shared, and sanctioned, appeared a mere idle vision.\n\nI see no room in this city for the gentle ways of love, for precious\nwalks in shady alleys, the full moon sparkling on the water, while the\nsuppliant pleads in vain. Rich, young, and beautiful, I have only to\nlove, and love would become my sole occupation, my life; yet in the\nthree months during which I have come and gone, eager and curious,\nnothing has appealed to me in the bright, covetous, keen eyes around me.\nNo voice has thrilled me, no glance has made the world seem brighter.\n\nMusic alone has filled my soul, music alone has at all taken the place\nof our friendship. Sometimes, at night, I will linger for an hour by\nmy window, gazing into the garden, summoning the future, with all it\nbrings, out of the mystery which shrouds it. There are days too when,\nhaving started for a drive, I get out and walk in the Champs-Elysees,\nand picture to myself that the man who is to waken my slumbering soul\nis at hand, that he will follow and look at me. Then I meet only\nmountebanks, vendors of gingerbread, jugglers, passers-by hurrying to\ntheir business, or lovers who try to escape notice. These I am tempted\nto stop, asking them, \"You who are happy, tell me what is love.\"\n\nBut the impulse is repressed, and I return to my carriage, swearing\nto die an old maid. Love is undoubtedly an incarnation, and how many\nconditions are needful before it can take place! We are not certain of\nnever quarreling with ourselves, how much less so when there are two?\nThis is a problem which God alone can solve.\n\nI begin to think that I shall return to the convent. If I remain in\nsociety, I shall do things which will look like follies, for I cannot\npossibly reconcile myself to what I see. I am perpetually wounded either\nin my sense of delicacy, my inner principles, or my secret thoughts.\n\nAh! my mother is the happiest of women, adored as she is by Canalis,\nher great little man. My love, do you know I am seized sometimes with a\nhorrible craving to know what goes on between my mother and that young\nman? Griffith tells me she has gone through all these moods; she has\nlonged to fly at women, whose happiness was written in their face; she\nhas blackened their character, torn them to pieces. According to her,\nvirtue consists in burying all these savage instincts in one's innermost\nheart. But what then of the heart? It becomes the sink of all that is\nworst in us.\n\nIt is very humiliating that no adorer has yet turned up for me. I am\na marriageable girl, but I have brothers, a family, relations, who are\nsensitive on the point of honor. Ah! if that is what keeps men back,\nthey are poltroons.\n\nThe part of Chimene in the _Cid_ and that of the Cid delight me. What a\nmarvelous play! Well, good-bye.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. THE SAME TO THE SAME January.\n\nOur master is a poor refugee, forced to keep in hiding on account of\nthe part he played in the revolution which the Duc d'Angouleme has\njust quelled--a triumph to which we owe some splendid fetes. Though a\nLiberal, and doubtless a man of the people, he has awakened my interest:\nI fancy that he must have been condemned to death. I make him talk for\nthe purpose of getting at his secret; but he is of a truly Castilian\ntaciturnity, proud as though he were Gonsalvo di Cordova, and\nnevertheless angelic in his patience and gentleness. His pride is not\nirritable like Miss Griffith's, it belongs to his inner nature; he\nforces us to civility because his own manners are so perfect, and holds\nus at a distance by the respect he shows us. My father declares that\nthere is a great deal of the nobleman in Senor Henarez, whom, among\nourselves, he calls in fun Don Henarez.\n\nA few days ago I took the liberty of addressing him thus. He raised his\neyes, which are generally bent on the ground, and flashed a look from\nthem that quite abashed me; my dear, he certainly has the most beautiful\neyes imaginable. I asked him if I had offended him in any way, and he\nsaid to me in his grand, rolling Spanish:\n\n\"I am here only to teach you Spanish.\"\n\nI blushed and felt quite snubbed. I was on the point of making some pert\nanswer, when I remembered what our dear mother in God used to say to us,\nand I replied instead:\n\n\"It would be a kindness to tell me if you have anything to complain of.\"\n\nA tremor passed through him, the blood rose in his olive cheeks; he\nreplied in a voice of some emotion:\n\n\"Religion must have taught you, better than I can, to respect the\nunhappy. Had I been a _don_ in Spain, and lost everything in the triumph\nof Ferdinand VII., your witticism would be unkind; but if I am only\na poor teacher of languages, is it not a heartless satire? Neither is\nworthy of a young lady of rank.\"\n\nI took his hand, saying:\n\n\"In the name of religion also, I beg you to pardon me.\"\n\nHe bowed, opened my _Don Quixote_, and sat down.\n\nThis little incident disturbed me more than the harvest of compliments,\ngazing and pretty speeches on my most successful evening. During the\nlesson I watched him attentively, which I could do the more safely, as\nhe never looks at me.\n\nAs the result of my observations, I made out that the tutor, whom we\ntook to be forty, is a young man, some years under thirty. My governess,\nto whom I had handed him over, remarked on the beauty of his black hair\nand of his pearly teeth. As to his eyes, they are velvet and fire; but\nhe is plain and insignificant. Though the Spaniards have been described\nas not a cleanly people, this man is most carefully got up, and his\nhands are whiter than his face. He stoops a little, and has an extremely\nlarge, oddly-shaped head. His ugliness, which, however, has a dash of\npiquancy, is aggravated by smallpox marks, which seam his face. His\nforehead is very prominent, and the shaggy eyebrows meet, giving a\nrepellent air of harshness. There is a frowning, plaintive look on his\nface, reminding one of a sickly child, which owes its life to superhuman\ncare, as Sister Marthe did. As my father observed, his features are a\nshrunken reproduction of those of Cardinal Ximenes. The natural dignity\nof our tutor's manners seems to disconcert the dear Duke, who doesn't\nlike him, and is never at ease with him; he can't bear to come in\ncontact with superiority of any kind.\n\nAs soon as my father knows enough Spanish, we start for Madrid. When\nHenarez returned, two days after the reproof he had given me, I remarked\nby way of showing my gratitude:\n\n\"I have no doubt that you left Spain in consequence of political events.\nIf my father is sent there, as seems to be expected, we shall be in a\nposition to help you, and might be able to obtain your pardon, in case\nyou are under sentence.\"\n\n\"It is impossible for any one to help me,\" he replied.\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"is that because you refuse to accept any help, or\nbecause the thing itself is impossible?\"\n\n\"Both,\" he said, with a bow, and in a tone which forbade continuing the\nsubject.\n\nMy father's blood chafed in my veins. I was offended by this haughty\ndemeanor, and promptly dropped Senor Henarez.\n\nAll the same, my dear, there is something fine in this rejection of\nany aid. \"He would not accept even our friendship,\" I reflected, whilst\nconjugating a verb. Suddenly I stopped short and told him what was in\nmy mind, but in Spanish. Henarez replied very politely that equality\nof sentiment was necessary between friends, which did not exist in this\ncase, and therefore it was useless to consider the question.\n\n\"Do you mean equality in the amount of feeling on either side, or\nequality in rank?\" I persisted, determined to shake him out of this\nprovoking gravity.\n\nHe raised once more those awe-inspiring eyes, and mine fell before them.\nDear, this man is a hopeless enigma. He seemed to ask whether my words\nmeant love; and the mixture of joy, pride, and agonized doubt in his\nglance went to my heart. It was plain that advances, which would be\ntaken for what they were worth in France, might land me in difficulties\nwith a Spaniard, and I drew back into my shell, feeling not a little\nfoolish.\n\nThe lesson over, he bowed, and his eyes were eloquent of the humble\nprayer: \"Don't trifle with a poor wretch.\"\n\nThis sudden contrast to his usual grave and dignified manner made a\ngreat impression on me. It seems horrible to think and to say, but I\ncan't help believing that there are treasures of affection in that man.\n\n\n\n\nIX. MME. DE L'ESTORADE TO MLLE. DE CHAULIEU. December.\n\nAll is over, my dear child, and it is Mme. de l'Estorade who writes to\nyou. But between us there is no change; it is only a girl the less.\n\nDon't be troubled; I did not give my consent recklessly or without much\nthought. My life is henceforth mapped out for me, and the freedom\nfrom all uncertainty as to the road for me to follow suits my mind and\ndisposition. A great moral power has stepped in, and once for all swept\nwhat we call chance out of my life. We have the property to develop, our\nhome to beautify and adorn; for me there is also a household to direct\nand sweeten and a husband to reconcile to life. In all probability I\nshall have a family to look after, children to educate.\n\nWhat would you have? Everyday life cannot be cast in heroic mould. No\ndoubt there seems, at any rate at first sight, no room left in this\nscheme of life for that longing after the infinite which expands the\nmind and soul. But what is there to prevent me from launching on that\nboundless sea our familiar craft? Nor must you suppose that the humble\nduties to which I dedicate my life give no scope for passion. To restore\nfaith in happiness to an unfortunate, who has been the sport of adverse\ncircumstances, is a noble work, and one which alone may suffice to\nrelieve the monotony of my existence. I can see no opening left for\nsuffering, and I see a great deal of good to be done. I need not hide\nfrom you that the love I have for Louis de l'Estorade is not of the kind\nwhich makes the heart throb at the sound of a step, and thrills us at\nthe lightest tones of a voice, or the caress of a burning glance; but,\non the other hand, there is nothing in him which offends me.\n\nWhat am I to do, you will ask, with that instinct for all which is great\nand noble, with those mental energies, which have made the link between\nus, and which we still possess? I admit that this thought has troubled\nme. But are these faculties less ours because we keep them concealed,\nusing them only in secret for the welfare of the family, as instruments\nto produce the happiness of those confided to our care, to whom we are\nbound to give ourselves without reserve? The time during which a woman\ncan look for admiration is short, it will soon be past; and if my life\nhas not been a great one, it will at least have been calm, tranquil,\nfree from shocks.\n\nNature has favored our sex in giving us a choice between love and\nmotherhood. I have made mine. My children shall be my gods, and this\nspot of earth my Eldorado.\n\nI can say no more to-day. Thank you much for all the things you have\nsent me. Give a glance at my needs on the enclosed list. I am determined\nto live in an atmosphere of refinement and luxury, and to take from\nprovincial life only what makes its charm. In solitude a woman can never\nbe vulgarized--she remains herself. I count greatly on your kindness for\nkeeping me up to the fashion. My father-in-law is so delighted that he\ncan refuse me nothing, and turns his house upside down. We are getting\nworkpeople from Paris and renovating everything.\n\n\n\n\nX. MLLE. DE CHAULIEU TO MME. DE L'ESTORADE January.\n\nOh! Renee, you have made me miserable for days! So that bewitching body,\nthose beautiful proud features, that natural grace of manner, that soul\nfull of priceless gifts, those eyes, where the soul can slake its thirst\nas at a fountain of love, that heart, with its exquisite delicacy,\nthat breadth of mind, those rare powers--fruit of nature and of\nour interchange of thought--treasures whence should issue a unique\nsatisfaction for passion and desire, hours of poetry to outweigh years,\njoys to make a man serve a lifetime for one gracious gesture,--all this\nis to be buried in the tedium of a tame, commonplace marriage, to vanish\nin the emptiness of an existence which you will come to loath! I hate\nyour children before they are born. They will be monsters!\n\nSo you know all that lies before you; you have nothing left to hope,\nor fear, or suffer? And supposing the glorious morning rises which will\nbring you face to face with the man destined to rouse you from the sleep\ninto which you are plunging!... Ah! a cold shiver goes through me at the\nthought!\n\nWell, at least you have a friend. You, it is understood, are to be the\nguardian angel of your valley. You will grow familiar with its beauties,\nwill live with it in all its aspects, till the grandeur of nature,\nthe slow growth of vegetation, compared with the lightning rapidity of\nthought, become like a part of yourself; and as your eye rests on\nthe laughing flowers, you will question your own heart. When you walk\nbetween your husband, silent and contented, in front, and your children\nscreaming and romping behind, I can tell you beforehand what you\nwill write to me. Your misty valley, your hills, bare or clothed with\nmagnificent trees, your meadow, the wonder of Provence, with its\nfresh water dispersed in little runlets, the different effects of the\natmosphere, this whole world of infinity which laps you round, and which\nGod has made so various, will recall to you the infinite sameness of\nyour soul's life. But at least I shall be there, my Renee, and in me you\nwill find a heart which no social pettiness shall ever corrupt, a heart\nall your own.\n\nMonday.\n\nMy dear, my Spaniard is quite adorably melancholy; there is something\ncalm, severe, manly, and mysterious about him which interests me\nprofoundly. His unvarying solemnity and the silence which envelops him\nact like an irritant on the mind. His mute dignity is worthy of a fallen\nking. Griffith and I spend our time over him as though he were a riddle.\n\nHow odd it is! A language-master captures my fancy as no other man has\ndone. Yet by this time I have passed in review all the young men of\nfamily, the attaches to embassies, and the ambassadors, generals, and\ninferior officers, the peers of France, their sons and nephews, the\ncourt, and the town.\n\nThe coldness of the man provokes me. The sandy waste which he tries to\nplace, and does place, between us is covered by his deeprooted pride; he\nwraps himself in mystery. The hanging back is on his side, the boldness\non mine. This odd situation affords me the more amusement because the\nwhole thing is mere trifling. What is a man, a Spaniard, and a teacher\nof languages to me? I make no account of any man whatever, were he a\nking. We are worth far more, I am sure, than the greatest of them. What\na slave I would have made of Napoleon! If he had loved me, shouldn't he\nhave felt the whip!\n\nYesterday I aimed a shaft at M. Henarez which must have touched him to\nthe quick. He made no reply; the lesson was over, and he bowed with a\nglance at me, in which I read that he would never return. This suits\nme capitally; there would be something ominous in starting an imitation\n_Nouvelle Heloise_. I have just been reading Rousseau's, and it has left\nme with a strong distaste for love. Passion which can argue and moralize\nseems to me detestable.\n\nClarissa also is much too pleased with herself and her long, little\nletter; but Richardson's work is an admirable picture, my father tells\nme, of English women. Rousseau's seems to me a sort of philosophical\nsermon, cast in the form of letters.\n\nLove, as I conceive it, is a purely subjective poem. In all that books\ntell us about it, there is nothing which is not at once false and true.\nAnd so, my pretty one, as you will henceforth be an authority only on\nconjugal love, it seems to me my duty--in the interest, of course, of\nour common life--to remain unmarried, and have a grand passion, so that\nwe may enlarge our experience.\n\nTell me every detail of what happens to you, especially in the first\nfew days, with that strange animal called a husband. I promise to do the\nsame for you if ever I am loved.\n\nFarewell, poor martyred darling.\n\n\n\n\nXI. MME. DE L'ESTORADE TO MLLE. DE CHAULIEU La Crampade.\n\nYour Spaniard and you make me shudder, my darling. I write this line to\nbeg of you to dismiss him. All that you say of him corresponds with the\ncharacter of those dangerous adventurers who, having nothing to lose,\nwill take any risk. This man cannot be your husband, and must not be\nyour lover. I will write to you more fully about the inner history of my\nmarried life when my heart is free from the anxiety your last letter has\nroused in it.\n\n\n\n\nXII. MLLE. DE CHAULIEU TO MME. DE L'ESTORADE February.\n\nAt nine o'clock this morning, sweetheart, my father was announced in my\nrooms. I was up and dressed. I found him solemnly seated beside the fire\nin the drawing-room, looking more thoughtful than usual. He pointed to\nthe armchair opposite to him. Divining his meaning, I sank into it\nwith a gravity, which so well aped his, that he could not refrain from\nsmiling, though the smile was dashed with melancholy.\n\n\"You are quite a match for your grandmother in quick-wittedness,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Come, father, don't play the courtier here,\" I replied; \"you want\nsomething from me.\"\n\nHe rose, visibly agitated, and talked to me for half an hour. This\nconversation, dear, really ought to be preserved. As soon as he had\ngone, I sat down to my table and tried to recall his words. This is the\nfirst time that I have seen my father revealing his inner thoughts.\n\nHe began by flattering me, and he did not do it badly. I was bound to be\ngrateful to him for having understood and appreciated me.\n\n\"Armande,\" he said, \"I was quite mistaken in you, and you have agreeably\nsurprised me. When you arrived from the convent, I took you for an\naverage young girl, ignorant and not particularly intelligent, easily\nto be bought off with gewgaws and ornaments, and with little turn for\nreflection.\"\n\n\"You are complimentary to young girls, father.\"\n\n\"Oh! there is no such thing as youth nowadays,\" he said, with the air\nof a diplomat. \"Your mind is amazingly open. You take everything at\nits proper worth; your clear-sightedness is extraordinary, there is no\nhoodwinking you. You pass for being blind, and all the time you have\nlaid your hand on causes, while other people are still puzzling over\neffects. In short, you are a minister in petticoats, the only person\nhere capable of understanding me. It follows, then, that if I have any\nsacrifice to ask from you, it is only to yourself I can turn for help in\npersuading you.\n\n\"I am therefore going to explain to you, quite frankly, my former plans,\nto which I still adhere. In order to recommend them to you, I must show\nthat they are connected with feelings of a very high order, and I\nshall thus be obliged to enter into political questions of the greatest\nimportance to the kingdom, which might be wearisome to any one less\nintelligent than you are. When you have heard me, I hope you will take\ntime for consideration, six months if necessary. You are entirely your\nown mistress; and if you decline to make the sacrifice I ask, I shall\nbow to your decision and trouble you no further.\"\n\nThis preface, my sweetheart, made me really serious, and I said:\n\n\"Speak, father.\"\n\nHere, then, is the deliverance of the statesman:\n\n\"My child, France is in a very critical position, which is understood\nonly by the King and a few superior minds. But the King is a head\nwithout arms; the great nobles, who are in the secret of the danger,\nhave no authority over the men whose co-operation is needful in order\nto bring about a happy result. These men, cast up by popular election,\nrefuse to lend themselves as instruments. Even the able men among them\ncarry on the work of pulling down society, instead of helping us to\nstrengthen the edifice.\n\n\"In a word, there are only two parties--the party of Marius and the\nparty of Sulla. I am for Sulla against Marius. This, roughly speaking,\nis our position. To go more into details: the Revolution is still\nactive; it is embedded in the law and written on the soil; it fills\npeople's minds. The danger is all the greater because the greater number\nof the King's counselors, seeing it destitute of armed forces and of\nmoney, believe it completely vanquished. The King is an able man, and\nnot easily blinded; but from day to day he is won over by his brother's\npartisans, who want to hurry things on. He has not two years to live,\nand thinks more of a peaceful deathbed than of anything else.\n\n\"Shall I tell you, my child, which is the most destructive of all the\nconsequences entailed by the Revolution? You would never guess. In Louis\nXVI. the Revolution has decapitated every head of a family. The family\nhas ceased to exist; we have only individuals. In their desire to become\na nation, Frenchmen have abandoned the idea of empire; in proclaiming\nthe equal rights of all children to their father's inheritance, they\nhave killed the family spirit and created the State treasury. But all\nthis has paved the way for weakened authority, for the blind force\nof the masses, for the decay of art and the supremacy of individual\ninterests, and has left the road open to the foreign invader.\n\n\"We stand between two policies--either to found the State on the basis\nof the family, or to rest it on individual interest--in other words,\nbetween democracy and aristocracy, between free discussion and\nobedience, between Catholicism and religious indifference. I am among\nthe few who are resolved to oppose what is called the people, and\nthat in the people's true interest. It is not now a question of feudal\nrights, as fools are told, nor of rank; it is a question of the State\nand of the existence of France. The country which does not rest on the\nfoundation of paternal authority cannot be stable. That is the foot of\nthe ladder of responsibility and subordination, which has for its summit\nthe King.\n\n\"The King stands for us all. To die for the King is to die for oneself,\nfor one's family, which, like the kingdom, cannot die. All animals have\ncertain instincts; the instinct of man is for family life. A country\nis strong which consists of wealthy families, every member of whom is\ninterested in defending a common treasure; it is weak when composed of\nscattered individuals, to whom it matters little whether they obey seven\nor one, a Russian or a Corsican, so long as each keeps his own plot\nof land, blind, in their wretched egotism, to the fact that the day is\ncoming when this too will be torn from them.\n\n\"Terrible calamities are in store for us, in case our party fails.\nNothing will be left but penal or fiscal laws--your money or your life.\nThe most generous nation on the earth will have ceased to obey the\ncall of noble instincts. Wounds past curing will have been fostered and\naggravated, an all pervading jealousy being the first. Then the upper\nclasses will be submerged; equality of desire will be taken for equality\nof strength; true distinction, even when proved and recognized, will\nbe threatened by the advancing tide of middle-class prejudice. It\nwas possible to choose one man out of a thousand, but, amongst three\nmillions, discrimination becomes impossible, when all are moved by\nthe same ambitions and attired in the same livery of mediocrity. No\nforesight will warn this victorious horde of that other terrible horde,\nsoon to be arrayed against them in the peasant proprietors; in other\nwords, twenty million acres of land, alive, stirring, arguing, deaf to\nreason, insatiable of appetite, obstructing progress, masters in their\nbrute force----\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, interrupting my father, \"what can I do to help the State.\nI feel no vocation for playing Joan of Arc in the interests of the\nfamily, or for finding a martyr's block in the convent.\"\n\n\"You are a little hussy,\" cried my father. \"If I speak sensibly to you,\nyou are full of jokes; when I jest, you talk like an ambassadress.\"\n\n\"Love lives on contrasts,\" was my reply.\n\nAnd he laughed till the tears stood in his eyes.\n\n\"You will reflect on what I have told you; you will do justice to the\nlarge and confiding spirit in which I have broached the matter, and\npossibly events may assist my plans. I know that, so far as you are\nconcerned, they are injurious and unfair, and this is the reason why I\nappeal for your sanction of them less to your heart and your imagination\nthan to your reason. I have found more judgment and commonsense in you\nthan in any one I know----\"\n\n\"You flatter yourself,\" I said, with a smile, \"for I am every inch your\nchild!\"\n\n\"In short,\" he went on, \"one must be logical. You can't have the end\nwithout the means, and it is our duty to set an example to others. From\nall this I deduce that you ought not to have money of your own till your\nyounger brother is provided for, and I want to employ the whole of your\ninheritance in purchasing an estate for him to go with the title.\"\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"you won't interfere with my living in my own fashion and\nenjoying life if I leave you my fortune?\"\n\n\"Provided,\" he replied, \"that your view of life does not conflict with\nthe family honor, reputation, and, I may add, glory.\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" I cried, \"what has become of my excellent judgment?\"\n\n\"There is not in all France,\" he said with bitterness, \"a man who would\ntake for wife a daughter of one of our noblest families without a dowry\nand bestow one on her. If such a husband could be found, it would\nbe among the class of rich _parvenus_; on this point I belong to the\neleventh century.\"\n\n\"And I also,\" I said. \"But why despair? Are there no aged peers?\"\n\n\"You are an apt scholar, Louise!\" he exclaimed.\n\nThen he left me, smiling and kissing my hand.\n\nI received your letter this very morning, and it led me to contemplate\nthat abyss into which you say that I may fall. A voice within seemed\nto utter the same warning. So I took my precautions. Henarez, my dear,\ndares to look at me, and his eyes are disquieting. They inspire me with\nwhat I can only call an unreasoning dread. Such a man ought no more to\nbe looked at than a frog; he is ugly and fascinating.\n\nFor two days I have been hesitating whether to tell my father\npoint-blank that I want no more Spanish lessons and have Henarez sent\nabout his business. But in spite of all my brave resolutions, I feel\nthat the horrible sensation which comes over me when I see that man has\nbecome necessary to me. I say to myself, \"Once more, and then I will\nspeak.\"\n\nHis voice, my dear, is sweetly thrilling; his speaking is just like la\nFodor's singing. His manners are simple, entirely free from affectation.\nAnd what teeth!\n\nJust now, as he was leaving, he seemed to divine the interest I take\nin him, and made a gesture--oh! most respectfully--as though to take my\nhand and kiss it; then checked himself, apparently terrified at his own\nboldness and the chasm he had been on the point of bridging. There was\nthe merest suggestion of all this, but I understood it and smiled, for\nnothing is more pathetic than to see the frank impulse of an inferior\nchecking itself abashed. The love of a plebeian for a girl of noble\nbirth implies such courage!\n\nMy smile emboldened him. The poor fellow looked blindly about for his\nhat; he seemed determined not to find it, and I handed it to him with\nperfect gravity. His eyes were wet with unshed tears. It was a mere\npassing moment, yet a world of facts and ideas were contained in it. We\nunderstood each other so well that, on a sudden, I held out my hand for\nhim to kiss.\n\nPossibly this was equivalent to telling him that love might bridge\nthe interval between us. Well, I cannot tell what moved me to do it.\nGriffith had her back turned as I proudly extended my little white paw.\nI felt the fire of his lips, tempered by two big tears. Oh! my love, I\nlay in my armchair, nerveless, dreamy. I was happy, and I cannot\nexplain to you how or why. What I felt only a poet could express.\nMy condescension, which fills me with shame now, seemed to me then\nsomething to be proud of; he had fascinated me, that is my one excuse.\n\nFriday.\n\nThis man is really very handsome. He talks admirably, and has remarkable\nintellectual power. My dear, he is a very Bossuet in force and\npersuasiveness when he explains the mechanism, not only of the Spanish\ntongue, but also of human thought and of all language. His mother tongue\nseems to be French. When I expressed surprise at this, he replied that\nhe came to France when quite a boy, following the King of Spain to\nValencay.\n\nWhat has passed within this enigmatic being? He is no longer the same\nman. He came, dressed quite simply, but just as any gentleman would for\na morning walk. He put forth all his eloquence, and flashed wit, like\nrays from a beacon, all through the lesson. Like a man roused from\nlethargy, he revealed to me a new world of thoughts. He told me the\nstory of some poor devil of a valet who gave up his life for a single\nglance from a queen of Spain.\n\n\"What could he do but die?\" I exclaimed.\n\nThis delighted him, and he looked at me in a way which was truly\nalarming.\n\nIn the evening I went to a ball at the Duchesse de Lenoncourt's. The\nPrince de Talleyrand happened to be there; and I got M. de Vandenesse,\na charming young man, to ask him whether, among the guests at his\ncountry-place in 1809, he remembered any one of the name of Henarez.\nVandenesse reported the Prince's reply, word for word, as follows:\n\n\"Henarez is the Moorish name of the Soria family, who are, they say,\ndescendants of the Abencerrages, converted to Christianity. The old Duke\nand his two sons were with the King. The eldest, the present Duke de\nSoria, has just had all his property, titles, and dignities confiscated\nby King Ferdinand, who in this way avenges a long-standing feud. The\nDuke made a huge mistake in consenting to form a constitutional ministry\nwith Valdez. Happily, he escaped from Cadiz before the arrival of the\nDuc d'Angouleme, who, with the best will in the world, could not have\nsaved him from the King's wrath.\"\n\nThis information gave me much food for reflection. I cannot describe to\nyou the suspense in which I passed the time till my next lesson, which\ntook place this morning.\n\nDuring the first quarter of an hour I examined him closely, debating\ninwardly whether he were duke or commoner, without being able to come to\nany conclusion. He seemed to read my fancies as they arose and to take\npleasure in thwarting them. At last I could endure it no longer. Putting\ndown my book suddenly, I broke off the translation I was making of it\naloud, and said to him in Spanish:\n\n\"You are deceiving us. You are no poor middle-class Liberal. You are the\nDuke de Soria!\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" he replied, with a gesture of sorrow, \"unhappily, I am\nnot the Duc de Soria.\"\n\nI felt all the despair with which he uttered the word \"unhappily.\" Ah!\nmy dear, never should I have conceived it possible to throw so much\nmeaning and passion into a single word. His eyes had dropped, and he\ndared no longer look at me.\n\n\"M. de Talleyrand,\" I said, \"in whose house you spent your years of\nexile, declares that any one bearing the name of Henarez must either be\nthe late Duc de Soria or a lacquey.\"\n\nHe looked at me with eyes like two black burning coals, at once blazing\nand ashamed. The man might have been in the torture-chamber. All he said\nwas:\n\n\"My father was in truth the servant of the King of Spain.\"\n\nGriffith could make nothing of this sort of lesson. An awkward silence\nfollowed each question and answer.\n\n\"In one word,\" I said, \"are you a nobleman or not?\"\n\n\"You know that in Spain even beggars are noble.\"\n\nThis reticence provoked me. Since the last lesson I had given play to my\nimagination in a little practical joke. I had drawn an ideal portrait\nof the man whom I should wish for my lover in a letter which I designed\ngiving to him to translate. So far, I had only put Spanish into French,\nnot French into Spanish; I pointed this out to him, and begged Griffith\nto bring me the last letter I had received from a friend of mine.\n\n\"I shall find out,\" I thought, from the effect my sketch has on him,\n\"what sort of blood runs in his veins.\"\n\nI took the paper from Griffith's hands, saying:\n\n\"Let me see if I have copied it rightly.\"\n\nFor it was all in my writing. I handed him the paper, or, if you will,\nthe snare, and I watched him while he read as follows:\n\n\"He who is to win my heart, my dear, must be harsh and unbending with\nmen, but gentle with women. His eagle eye must have power to quell with\na single glance the least approach to ridicule. He will have a pitying\nsmile for those who would jeer at sacred things, above all, at\nthat poetry of the heart, without which life would be but a dreary\ncommonplace. I have the greatest scorn for those who would rob us of\nthe living fountain of religious beliefs, so rich in solace. His faith,\ntherefore, should have the simplicity of a child, though united to the\nfirm conviction of an intelligent man, who has examined the foundations\nof his creed. His fresh and original way of looking at things must be\nentirely free from affectation or desire to show off. His words will\nbe few and fit, and his mind so richly stored, that he cannot possibly\nbecome a bore to himself any more than to others.\n\n\"All his thoughts must have a high and chivalrous character, without\nalloy of self-seeking; while his actions should be marked by a total\nabsence of interested or sordid motives. Any weak points he may have\nwill arise from the very elevation of his views above those of the\ncommon herd, for in every respect I would have him superior to his age.\nEver mindful of the delicate attentions due to the weak, he will be\ngentle to all women, but not prone lightly to fall in love with any; for\nlove will seem to him too serious to turn into a game.\n\n\"Thus it might happen that he would spend his life in ignorance of\ntrue love, while all the time possessing those qualities most fitted\nto inspire it. But if ever he find the ideal woman who has haunted his\nwaking dreams, if he meet with a nature capable of understanding his\nown, one who could fill his soul and pour sunlight over his life, could\nshine as a star through the mists of this chill and gloomy world, lend\nfresh charm to existence, and draw music from the hitherto silent chords\nof his being--needless to say, he would recognize and welcome his good\nfortune.\n\n\"And she, too, would be happy. Never, by word or look, would he wound\nthe tender heart which abandoned itself to him, with the blind trust of\na child reposing in its mother's arms. For were the vision shattered, it\nwould be the wreck of her inner life. To the mighty waters of love she\nwould confide her all!\n\n\"The man I picture must belong, in expression, in attitude, in gait, in\nhis way of performing alike the smallest and the greatest actions, to\nthat race of the truly great who are always simple and natural. He need\nnot be good-looking, but his hands must be beautiful. His upper lip will\ncurl with a careless, ironic smile for the general public, whilst he\nreserves for those he loves the heavenly, radiant glance in which he\nputs his soul.\"\n\n\"Will mademoiselle allow me,\" he said in Spanish, in a voice full of\nagitation, \"to keep this writing in memory of her? This is the last\nlesson I shall have the honor of giving her, and that which I have just\nreceived in these words may serve me for an abiding rule of life. I\nleft Spain, a fugitive and penniless, but I have to-day received from\nmy family a sum sufficient for my needs. You will allow me to send some\npoor Spaniard in my place.\"\n\nIn other words, he seemed to me to say, \"This little game must stop.\" He\nrose with an air of marvelous dignity, and left me quite upset by such\nunheard-of delicacy in a man of his class. He went downstairs and asked\nto speak with my father.\n\nAt dinner my father said to me with a smile:\n\n\"Louise, you have been learning Spanish from an ex-minister and a man\ncondemned to death.\"\n\n\"The Duc de Soria,\" I said.\n\n\"Duke!\" replied my father. \"No, he is not that any longer; he takes the\ntitle now of Baron de Macumer from a property which still remains to him\nin Sardinia. He is something of an original, I think.\"\n\n\"Don't brand with that word, which with you always implies some mockery\nand scorn, a man who is your equal, and who, I believe, has a noble\nnature.\"\n\n\"Baronne de Macumer?\" exclaimed my father, with a laughing glance at me.\n\nPride kept my eyes fixed on the table.\n\n\"But,\" said my mother, \"Henarez must have met the Spanish ambassador on\nthe steps?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied my father, \"the ambassador asked me if I was conspiring\nagainst the King, his master; but he greeted the ex-grandee of Spain\nwith much deference, and placed his services at his disposal.\"\n\nAll this, dear, Mme. de l'Estorade, happened a fortnight ago, and it\nis a fortnight now since I have seen the man who loves me, for that he\nloves me there is not a doubt. What is he about? If only I were a fly,\nor a mouse, or a sparrow! I want to see him alone, myself unseen, at his\nhouse. Only think, a man exists, to whom I can say, \"Go and die for me!\"\nAnd he is so made that he would go, at least I think so. Anyhow, there\nis in Paris a man who occupies my thoughts, and whose glance pours\nsunshine into my soul. Is not such a man an enemy, whom I ought to\ntrample under foot? What? There is a man who has become necessary to\nme--a man without whom I don't know how to live! You married, and I--in\nlove! Four little months, and those two doves, whose wings erst bore\nthem so high, have fluttered down upon the flat stretches of real life!\n\nSunday.\n\nYesterday, at the Italian Opera, I could feel some one was looking at\nme; my eyes were drawn, as by a magnet, to two wells of fire, gleaming\nlike carbuncles in a dim corner of the orchestra. Henarez never moved\nhis eyes from me. The wretch had discovered the one spot from which\nhe could see me--and there he was. I don't know what he may be as a\npolitician, but for love he has a genius.\n\n  Behold, my fair Renee, where our business now stands,\n\nas the great Corneille has said.\n\n\n\n\nXIII. MME. DE L'ESTORADE TO MLLE. DE CHAULIEU LA CRAMPADE, February.\n\nMy dear Louise,--I was bound to wait some time before writing to you;\nbut now I know, or rather I have learned, many things which, for the\nsake of your future happiness, I must tell you. The difference between\na girl and a married woman is so vast, that the girl can no more\ncomprehend it than the married woman can go back to girlhood again.\n\nI chose to marry Louis de l'Estorade rather than return to the convent;\nthat at least is plain. So soon as I realized that the convent was the\nonly alternative to marrying Louis, I had, as girls say, to \"submit,\"\nand my submission once made, the next thing was to examine the situation\nand try to make the best of it.\n\nThe serious nature of what I was undertaking filled me at first with\nterror. Marriage is a matter concerning the whole of life, whilst love\naims only at pleasure. On the other hand, marriage will remain when\npleasures have vanished, and it is the source of interests far more\nprecious than those of the man and woman entering on the alliance. Might\nit not therefore be that the only requisite for a happy marriage was\nfriendship--a friendship which, for the sake of these advantages, would\nshut its eyes to many of the imperfections of humanity? Now there was\nno obstacle to the existence of friendship between myself and Louis\nde l'Estorade. Having renounced all idea of finding in marriage those\ntransports of love on which our minds used so often, and with such\nperilous rapture, to dwell, I found a gentle calm settling over me.\n\"If debarred from love, why not seek for happiness?\" I said to myself.\n\"Moreover, I am loved, and the love offered me I shall accept. My\nmarried life will be no slavery, but rather a perpetual reign. What is\nthere to say against such a situation for a woman who wishes to remain\nabsolute mistress of herself?\"\n\nThe important point of separating marriage from marital rights was\nsettled in a conversation between Louis and me, in the course of which\nhe gave proof of an excellent temper and a tender heart. Darling, my\ndesire was to prolong that fair season of hope which, never culminating\nin satisfaction, leaves to the soul its virginity. To grant nothing\nto duty or the law, to be guided entirely by one's own will, retaining\nperfect independence--what could be more attractive, more honorable?\n\nA contract of this kind, directly opposed to the legal contract, and\neven to the sacrament itself, could be concluded only between Louis and\nme. This difficulty, the first which has arisen, is the only one which\nhas delayed the completion of our marriage. Although, at first, I\nmay have made up my mind to accept anything rather than return to the\nconvent, it is only in human nature, having got an inch, to ask for an\nell, and you and I, sweet love, are of those who would have it all.\n\nI watched Louis out of the corner of my eye, and put it to myself, \"Has\nsuffering had a softening or a hardening effect on him?\" By dint of\nclose study, I arrived at the conclusion that his love amounted to a\npassion. Once transformed into an idol, whose slightest frown would turn\nhim white and trembling, I realized that I might venture anything. I\ndrew him aside in the most natural manner on solitary walks, during\nwhich I discreetly sounded his feelings. I made him talk, and got him to\nexpound to me his ideas and plans for our future. My questions betrayed\nso many preconceived notions, and went so straight for the weak points\nin this terrible dual existence, that Louis has since confessed to me\nthe alarm it caused him to find in me so little of the ignorant maiden.\n\nThen I listened to what he had to say in reply. He got mixed up in his\narguments, as people do when handicapped by fear; and before long it\nbecame clear that chance had given me for adversary one who was the\nless fitted for the contest because he was conscious of what you\nmagniloquently call my \"greatness of soul.\" Broken by sufferings and\nmisfortune, he looked on himself as a sort of wreck, and three fears in\nespecial haunted him.\n\nFirst, we are aged respectively thirty-seven and seventeen; and he could\nnot contemplate without quaking the twenty years that divide us. In the\nnext place, he shares our views on the subject of my beauty, and it is\ncruel for him to see how the hardships of his life have robbed him\nof youth. Finally, he felt the superiority of my womanhood over his\nmanhood. The consciousness of these three obvious drawbacks made him\ndistrustful of himself; he doubted his power to make me happy, and\nguessed that he had been chosen as the lesser of two evils.\n\nOne evening he tentatively suggested that I only married him to escape\nthe convent.\n\n\"I cannot deny it,\" was my grave reply.\n\nMy dear, it touched me to the heart to see the two great tears which\nstood in his eyes. Never before had I experienced the shock of emotion\nwhich a man can impart to us.\n\n\"Louis,\" I went on, as kindly as I could, \"it rests entirely with you\nwhether this marriage of convenience becomes one to which I can give\nmy whole heart. The favor I am about to ask from you will demand\nunselfishness on your part, far nobler than the servitude to which a\nman's love, when sincere, is supposed to reduce him. The question is,\nCan you rise to the height of friendship such as I understand it?\n\n\"Life gives us but one friend, and I wish to be yours. Friendship is the\nbond between a pair of kindred souls, united in their strength, and yet\nindependent. Let us be friends and comrades to bear jointly the burden\nof life. Leave me absolutely free. I would put no hindrance in the\nway of your inspiring me with a love similar to your own; but I am\ndetermined to be yours only of my own free gift. Create in me the wish\nto give up my freedom, and at once I lay it at your feet.\n\n\"Infuse with passion, then, if you will, this friendship, and let the\nvoice of love disturb its calm. On my part I will do what I can to bring\nmy feelings into accord with yours. One thing, above all, I would beg\nof you. Spare me the annoyances to which the strangeness of our mutual\nposition might give rise to our relations with others. I am neither\nwhimsical nor prudish, and should be sorry to get that reputation; but\nI feel sure that I can trust to your honor when I ask you to keep up the\noutward appearance of wedded life.\"\n\nNever, dear, have I seen a man so happy as my proposal made Louis. The\nblaze of joy which kindled in his eyes dried up the tears.\n\n\"Do not fancy,\" I concluded, \"that I ask this from any wish to be\neccentric. It is the great desire I have for your respect which prompts\nmy request. If you owe the crown of your love merely to the legal and\nreligious ceremony, what gratitude could you feel to me later for a\ngift in which my goodwill counted for nothing? If during the time that I\nremained indifferent to you (yielding only a passive obedience, such as\nmy mother has just been urging on me) a child were born to us, do you\nsuppose that I could feel towards it as I would towards one born of our\ncommon love? A passionate love may not be necessary in marriage, but, at\nleast, you will admit that there should be no repugnance. Our position\nwill not be without its dangers; in a country life, such as ours will\nbe, ought we not to bear in mind the evanescent nature of passion? Is it\nnot simple prudence to make provision beforehand against the calamities\nincident to change of feeling?\"\n\nHe was greatly astonished to find me at once so reasonable and so apt at\nreasoning; but he made me a solemn promise, after which I took his hand\nand pressed it affectionately.\n\nWe were married at the end of the week. Secure of my freedom, I was able\nto throw myself gaily into the petty details which always accompany a\nceremony of the kind, and to be my natural self. Perhaps I may have been\ntaken for an old bird, as they say at Blois. A young girl, delighted\nwith the novel and hopeful situation she had contrived to make for\nherself, and may have passed for a strong-minded female.\n\nDear, the difficulties which would beset my life had appeared to\nme clearly as in a vision, and I was sincerely anxious to make the\nhappiness of the man I married. Now, in the solitude of a life like\nours, marriage soon becomes intolerable unless the woman is the\npresiding spirit. A woman in such a case needs the charm of a mistress,\ncombined with the solid qualities of a wife. To introduce an element\nof uncertainty into pleasure is to prolong illusion, and render lasting\nthose selfish satisfactions which all creatures hold, and should shroud\na woman in expectancy, crown her sovereign, and invest her with an\nexhaustless power, a redundancy of life, that makes everything blossom\naround her. The more she is mistress of herself, the more certainly will\nthe love and happiness she creates be fit to weather the storms of life.\n\nBut, above all, I have insisted on the greatest secrecy in regard to\nour domestic arrangements. A husband who submits to his wife's yoke\nis justly held an object of ridicule. A woman's influence ought to be\nentirely concealed. The charm of all we do lies in its unobtrusiveness.\nIf I have made it my task to raise a drooping courage and restore their\nnatural brightness to gifts which I have dimly descried, it must all\nseem to spring from Louis himself.\n\nSuch is the mission to which I dedicate myself, a mission surely not\nignoble, and which might well satisfy a woman's ambition. Why, I could\nglory in this secret which shall fill my life with interest, in this\ntask towards which my every energy shall be bent, while it remains\nconcealed from all but God and you.\n\nI am very nearly happy now, but should I be so without a friendly heart\nin which to pour the confession? For how make a confidant of him? My\nhappiness would wound him, and has to be concealed. He is sensitive as a\nwoman, like all men who have suffered much.\n\nFor three months we remained as we were before marriage. As you may\nimagine, during this time I made a close study of many small personal\nmatters, which have more to do with love than is generally supposed. In\nspite of my coldness, Louis grew bolder, and his nature expanded. I saw\non his face a new expression, a look of youth. The greater refinement\nwhich I introduced into the house was reflected in his person.\nInsensibly I became accustomed to his presence, and made another self\nof him. By dint of constant watching I discovered how his mind and\ncountenance harmonize. \"The animal that we call a husband,\" to quote\nyour words, disappeared, and one balmy evening I discovered in his stead\na lover, whose words thrilled me and on whose arm I leant with pleasure\nbeyond words. In short, to be open with you, as I would be with God,\nbefore whom concealment is impossible, the perfect loyalty with which\nhe had kept his oath may have piqued me, and I felt a fluttering of\ncuriosity in my heart. Bitterly ashamed, I struggled with myself. Alas!\nwhen pride is the only motive for resistance, excuses for capitulation\nare soon found.\n\nWe celebrated our union in secret, and secret it must remain between us.\nWhen you are married you will approve this reserve. Enough that nothing\nwas lacking either of satisfaction for the most fastidious sentiment, or\nof that unexpectedness which brings, in a sense, its own sanction. Every\nwitchery of imagination, of passion, of reluctance overcome, of the\nideal passing into reality, played its part.\n\nYet, in spite of all this enchantment, I once more stood out for my\ncomplete independence. I can't tell you all my reasons for this. To\nyou alone shall I confide even as much as this. I believe that women,\nwhether passionately loved or not, lose much in their relation with\ntheir husbands by not concealing their feelings about marriage and the\nway they look at it.\n\nMy one joy, and it is supreme, springs from the certainty of having\nbrought new life to my husband before I have borne him any children.\nLouis has regained his youth, strength, and spirits. He is not the same\nman. With magic touch I have effaced the very memory of his sufferings.\nIt is a complete metamorphosis. Louis is really very attractive now.\nFeeling sure of my affection, he throws off his reserve and displays\nunsuspected gifts.\n\nTo be the unceasing spring of happiness for a man who knows it and adds\ngratitude to love, ah! dear one, this is a conviction which fortifies\nthe soul, even more than the most passionate love can do. The force\nthus developed--at once impetuous and enduring, simple and\ndiversified--brings forth ultimately the family, that noble product of\nwomanhood, which I realize now in all its animating beauty.\n\nThe old father has ceased to be a miser. He gives blindly whatever I\nwish for. The servants are content; it seems as though the bliss of\nLouis had let a flood of sunshine into the household, where love has\nmade me queen. Even the old man would not be a blot upon my pretty home,\nand has brought himself into line with all my improvements; to please me\nhe has adopted the dress, and with the dress, the manners of the day.\n\nWe have English horses, a coupe, a barouche, and a tilbury. The livery\nof our servants is simple but in good taste. Of course we are looked\non as spendthrifts. I apply all my intellect (I am speaking quite\nseriously) to managing my household with economy, and obtaining for it\nthe maximum of pleasure with the minimum of cost.\n\nI have already convinced Louis of the necessity of getting roads made,\nin order that he may earn the reputation of a man interested in the\nwelfare of his district. I insist too on his studying a great deal.\nBefore long I hope to see him a member of the Council General of the\nDepartment, through the influence of my family and his mother's. I have\ntold him plainly that I am ambitious, and that I was very well pleased\nhis father should continue to look after the estate and practise\neconomies, because I wished him to devote himself exclusively to\npolitics. If we had children, I should like to see them all prosperous\nand with good State appointments. Under penalty, therefore, of\nforfeiting my esteem and affection, he must get himself chosen deputy\nfor the department at the coming elections; my family would support his\ncandidature, and we should then have the delight of spending all our\nwinters in Paris. Ah! my love, by the ardor with which he embraced my\nplans, I can gauge the depth of his affection.\n\nTo conclude here is a letter he wrote me yesterday from Marseilles,\nwhere he had gone to spend a few hours:\n\n  \"MY SWEET RENEE,--When you gave me permission to love you, I began\n  to believe in happiness; now, I see it unfolding endlessly before\n  me. The past is merely a dim memory, a shadowy background, without\n  which my present bliss would show less radiant. When I am with\n  you, love so transports me that I am powerless to express the\n  depth of my affection; I can but worship and admire. Only at a\n  distance does the power of speech return. You are supremely\n  beautiful, Renee, and your beauty is of the statuesque and regal\n  type, on which time leaves but little impression. No doubt the\n  love of husband and wife depends less on outward beauty than on\n  graces of character, which are yours also in perfection; still,\n  let me say that the certainty of having your unchanging beauty, on\n  which to feast my eyes, gives me a joy that grows with every\n  glance. There is a grace and dignity in the lines of your face,\n  expressive of the noble soul within, and breathing of purity\n  beneath the vivid coloring. The brilliance of your dark eyes, the\n  bold sweep of your forehead, declare a spirit of no common\n  elevation, sound and trustworthy in every relation, and well\n  braced to meet the storms of life, should such arise. The keynote\n  of your character is its freedom from all pettiness. You do not\n  need to be told all this; but I write it because I would have you\n  know that I appreciate the treasure I possess. Your favors to me,\n  however slight, will always make my happiness in the far-distant\n  future as now; for I am sensible how much dignity there is in our\n  promise to respect each other's liberty. Our own impulse shall\n  with us alone dictate the expression of feeling. We shall be free\n  even in our fetters. I shall have the more pride in wooing you\n  again now that I know the reward you place on victory. You cannot\n  speak, breathe, act, or think, without adding to the admiration I\n  feel for your charm both of body and mind. There is in you a rare\n  combination of the ideal, the practical, and the bewitching which\n  satisfies alike judgment, a husband's pride, desire, and hope, and\n  which extends the boundaries of love beyond those of life itself.\n  Oh! my loved one, may the genius of love remain faithful to me,\n  and the future be full of those delights by means of which you\n  have glorified all that surrounds me! I long for the day which\n  shall make you a mother, that I may see you content with the\n  fulness of your life, may hear you, in the sweet voice I love and\n  with the thoughts, bless the love which has refreshed my soul and\n  given new vigor to my powers, the love which is my pride, and\n  whence I have drawn, as from a magic fountain, fresh life. Yes, I\n  shall be all that you would have me. I shall take a leading part\n  in the public life of the district, and on you shall fall the rays\n  of a glory which will owe its existence to the desire of pleasing\n  you.\"\n\nSo much for my pupil, dear! Do you suppose he could have written like\nthis before? A year hence his style will have still further improved.\nLouis is now in his first transport; what I look forward to is the\nuniform and continuous sensation of content which ought to be the fruit\nof a happy marriage, when a man and woman, in perfect trust and mutual\nknowledge, have solved the problem of giving variety to the infinite.\nThis is the task set before every true wife; the answer begins to dawn\non me, and I shall not rest till I have made it mine.\n\nYou see that he fancies himself--vanity of men!--the chosen of my heart,\njust as though there were no legal bonds. Nevertheless, I have not yet\ngot beyond that external attraction which gives us strength to put up\nwith a good deal. Yet Louis is lovable; his temper is wonderfully even,\nand he performs, as a matter of course, acts on which most men would\nplume themselves. In short, if I do not love him, I shall find no\ndifficulty in being good to him.\n\nSo here are my black hair and my black eyes--whose lashes act, according\nto you, like Venetian blinds--my commanding air, and my whole person,\nraised to the rank of sovereign power! Ten years hence, dear, why should\nwe not both be laughing and gay in your Paris, whence I shall carry you\noff now and again to my beautiful oasis in Provence?\n\nOh! Louise, don't spoil the splendid future which awaits us both! Don't\ndo the mad things with which you threaten me. My husband is a young man,\nprematurely old; why don't you marry some young-hearted graybeard in the\nChamber of Peers? There lies your vocation.\n\n\n\n\nXIV. THE DUC DE SORIA TO THE BARON DE MACUMER MADRID.\n\nMY DEAR BROTHER,--You did not make me Duc de Soria in order that my\nactions should belie the name. How could I tolerate my happiness if\nI knew you to be a wanderer, deprived of the comforts which wealth\neverywhere commands? Neither Marie nor I will consent to marry till we\nhear that you have accepted the money which Urraca will hand over to\nyou. These two millions are the fruit of your own savings and Marie's.\n\nWe have both prayed, kneeling before the same altar--and with what\nearnestness, God knows!--for your happiness. My dear brother, it cannot\nbe that these prayers will remain unanswered. Heaven will send you the\nlove which you seek, to be the consolation of your exile. Marie read\nyour letter with tears, and is full of admiration for you. As for me,\nI consent, not for my own sake, but for that of the family. The King\njustified your expectations. Oh! that I might avenge you by letting him\nsee himself, dwarfed before the scorn with which you flung him his toy,\nas you might toss a tiger its food.\n\nThe only thing I have taken for myself, dear brother, is my happiness.\nI have taken Marie. For this I shall always be beholden to you, as the\ncreature to the Creator. There will be in my life and in Marie's one day\nnot less glorious than our wedding day--it will be the day when we hear\nthat your heart has found its mate, that a woman loves you as you ought\nto be, and would be, loved. Do not forget that if you live for us, we\nalso live for you.\n\nYou can write to us with perfect confidence under cover to the Nuncio,\nsending your letters _via_ Rome. The French ambassador at Rome will,\nno doubt, undertake to forward them to Monsignore Bemboni, at the State\nSecretary's office, whom our legate will have advised. No other way\nwould be safe. Farewell, dear exile, dear despoiled one. Be proud at\nleast of the happiness which you have brought to us, if you cannot be\nhappy in it. God will doubtless hear our prayers, which are full of your\nname.\n\n\n\n\nXV. LOUISE DE CHAULIEU TO MME. DE L'ESTORADE March.\n\nAh! my love, marriage is making a philosopher of you! Your darling face\nmust, indeed, have been jaundiced when you wrote me those terrible views\nof human life and the duty of women. Do you fancy you will convert me to\nmatrimony by your programme of subterranean labors?\n\nAlas! is this then the outcome for you of our too-instructed dreams! We\nleft Blois all innocent, armed with the pointed shafts of meditation,\nand, lo! the weapons of that purely ideal experience have turned against\nyour own breast! If I did not know you for the purest and most angelic\nof created beings, I declare I should say that your calculations smack\nof vice. What, my dear, in the interest of your country home, you submit\nyour pleasures to a periodic thinning, as you do your timber. Oh! rather\nlet me perish in all the violence of the heart's storms than live in the\narid atmosphere of your cautious arithmetic!\n\nAs girls, we were both unusually enlightened, because of the large\namount of study we gave to our chosen subjects; but, my child,\nphilosophy without love, or disguised under a sham love, is the most\nhideous of conjugal hypocrisies. I should imagine that even the biggest\nof fools might detect now and again the owl of wisdom squatting in your\nbower of roses--a ghastly phantom sufficient to put to flight the most\npromising of passions. You make your own fate, instead of waiting, a\nplaything in its hands.\n\nWe are each developing in strange ways. A large dose of philosophy to\na grain of love is your recipe; a large dose of love to a grain of\nphilosophy is mine. Why, Rousseau's Julie, whom I thought so learned, is\na mere beginner to you. Woman's virtue, quotha! How you have weighed up\nlife! Alas! I make fun of you, and, after all, perhaps you are right.\n\nIn one day you have made a holocaust of your youth and become a miser\nbefore your time. Your Louis will be happy, I daresay. If he loves you,\nof which I make no doubt, he will never find out, that, for the sake of\nyour family, you are acting as a courtesan does for money; and certainly\nmen seem to find happiness with them, judging by the fortunes they\nsquander thus. A keen-sighted husband might no doubt remain in love\nwith you, but what sort of gratitude could he feel in the long run for a\nwoman who had made of duplicity a sort of moral armor, as indispensable\nas her stays?\n\nLove, dear, is in my eyes the first principle of all the virtues,\nconformed to the divine likeness. Like all other first principles, it is\nnot a matter of arithmetic; it is the Infinite in us. I cannot but think\nyou have been trying to justify in your own eyes the frightful position\nof a girl, married to a man for whom she feels nothing more than esteem.\nYou prate of duty, and make it your rule and measure; but surely to take\nnecessity as the spring of action is the moral theory of atheism?\nTo follow the impulse of love and feeling is the secret law of every\nwoman's heart. You are acting a man's part, and your Louis will have to\nplay the woman!\n\nOh! my dear, your letter has plunged me into an endless train of\nthought. I see now that the convent can never take the place of mother\nto a girl. I beg of you, my grand angel with the black eyes, so pure\nand proud, so serious and so pretty, do not turn away from these cries,\nwhich the first reading of your letter has torn from me! I have taken\ncomfort in the thought that, while I was lamenting, love was doubtless\nbusy knocking down the scaffolding of reason.\n\nIt may be that I shall do worse than you without any reasoning or\ncalculations. Passion is an element in life bound to have a logic not\nless pitiless than yours.\n\nMonday.\n\nYesterday night I placed myself at the window as I was going to bed, to\nlook at the sky, which was wonderfully clear. The stars were like silver\nnails, holding up a veil of blue. In the silence of the night I could\nhear some one breathing, and by the half-light of the stars I saw my\nSpaniard, perched like a squirrel on the branches of one of the trees\nlining the boulevard, and doubtless lost in admiration of my windows.\n\nThe first effect of this discovery was to make me withdraw into the\nroom, my feet and hands quite limp and nerveless; but, beneath the fear,\nI was conscious of a delicious undercurrent of joy. I was overpowered\nbut happy. Not one of those clever Frenchmen, who aspire to marry me,\nhas had the brilliant idea of spending the night in an elm-tree at the\nrisk of being carried off by the watch. My Spaniard has, no doubt, been\nthere for some time. Ah! he won't give me any more lessons, he wants to\nreceive them--well, he shall have one. If only he knew what I said to\nmyself about his superficial ugliness! Others can philosophize besides\nyou, Renee! It was horrid, I argued, to fall in love with a handsome\nman. Is it not practically avowing that the senses count for three parts\nout of four in a passion which ought to be super-sensual?\n\nHaving got over my first alarm, I craned my neck behind the window in\norder to see him again--and well was I rewarded! By means of a hollow\ncane he blew me in through the window a letter, cunningly rolled round a\nleaden pellet.\n\nGood Heavens! will he suppose I left the window open on purpose?\n\nBut what was to be done? To shut it suddenly would be to make oneself an\naccomplice.\n\nI did better. I returned to my window as though I had seen nothing and\nheard nothing of the letter, then I said aloud:\n\n\"Come and look at the stars, Griffith.\"\n\nGriffith was sleeping as only old maids can. But the Moor, hearing me,\nslid down, and vanished with ghostly rapidity.\n\nHe must have been dying of fright, and so was I, for I did not hear him\ngo away; apparently he remained at the foot of the elm. After a good\nquarter of an hour, during which I lost myself in contemplation of the\nheavens, and battled with the waves of curiosity, I closed my widow and\nsat down on the bed to unfold the delicate bit of paper, with the tender\ntouch of a worker amongst the ancient manuscripts at Naples. It felt\nredhot to my fingers. \"What a horrible power this man has over me!\" I\nsaid to myself.\n\nAll at once I held out the paper to the candle--I would burn it without\nreading a word. Then a thought stayed me, \"What can he have to say that\nhe writes so secretly?\" Well, dear, I _did_ burn it, reflecting that,\nthough any other girl in the world would have devoured the letter, it\nwas not fitting that I--Armande-Louise-Marie de Chaulieu--should read\nit.\n\nThe next day, at the Italian opera, he was at his post. But I feel sure\nthat, ex-prime minister of a constitutional government though he is, he\ncould not discover the slightest agitation of mind in any movement of\nmine. I might have seen nothing and received nothing the evening before.\nThis was most satisfactory to me, but he looked very sad. Poor man! in\nSpain it is so natural for love to come in at the window!\n\nDuring the interval, it seems, he came and walked in the passages. This\nI learned from the chief secretary of the Spanish embassy, who also told\nthe story of a noble action of his.\n\nAs Duc de Soria he was to marry one of the richest heiresses in Spain,\nthe young princess Marie Heredia, whose wealth would have mitigated the\nbitterness of exile. But it seems that Marie, disappointing the wishes\nof the fathers, who had betrothed them in their earliest childhood,\nloved the younger son of the house of Soria, to whom my Felipe, gave her\nup. Allowing himself to be despoiled by the King of Spain.\n\n\"He would perform this piece of heroism quite simply,\" I said to the\nyoung man.\n\n\"You know him then?\" was his ingenuous reply.\n\nMy mother smiled.\n\n\"What will become of him, for he is condemned to death?\" I asked.\n\n\"Though dead to Spain, he can live in Sardinia.\"\n\n\"Ah! then Spain is the country of tombs as well as castles?\" I said,\ntrying to carry it off as a joke.\n\n\"There is everything in Spain, even Spaniards of the old school,\" my\nmother replied.\n\n\"The Baron de Macumer obtained a passport, not without difficulty, from\nthe King of Sardinia,\" the young diplomatist went on. \"He has now become\na Sardinian subject, and he possesses a magnificent estate in the island\nwith full feudal rights. He has a palace at Sassari. If Ferdinand VII.\nwere to die, Macumer would probably go in for diplomacy, and the Court\nof Turin would make him ambassador. Though young, he is--\"\n\n\"Ah! he is young?\"\n\n\"Certainly, mademoiselle... though young, he is one of the most\ndistinguished men in Spain.\"\n\nI scanned the house meanwhile through my opera-glass, and seemed to\nlend an inattentive ear to the secretary; but, between ourselves, I was\nwretched at having burnt his letter. In what terms would a man like that\nexpress his love? For he does love me. To be loved, adored in secret;\nto know that in this house, where all the great men of Paris were\ncollected, there was one entirely devoted to me, unknown to everybody!\nAh! Renee, now I understand the life of Paris, its balls, and its\ngaieties. It all flashed on me in the true light. When we love, we\nmust have society, were it only to sacrifice it to our love. I felt\na different creature--and such a happy one! My vanity, pride,\nself-love,--all were flattered. Heaven knows what glances I cast upon\nthe audience!\n\n\"Little rogue!\" the Duchess whispered in my ear with a smile.\n\nYes, Renee, my wily mother had deciphered the hidden joy in my bearing,\nand I could only haul down my flag before such feminine strategy. Those\ntwo words taught me more of worldly wisdom than I have been able to pick\nup in a year--for we are in March now. Alas! no more Italian opera in\nanother month. How will life be possible without that heavenly music,\nwhen one's heart is full of love?\n\nWhen I got home, my dear, with determination worthy of a Chaulieu, I\nopened my window to watch a shower of rain. Oh! if men knew the magic\nspell that a heroic action throws over us, they would indeed rise to\ngreatness! a poltroon would turn hero! What I had learned about my\nSpaniard drove me into a very fever. I felt certain that he was there,\nready to aim another letter at me.\n\nI was right, and this time I burnt nothing. Here, then, is the first\nlove-letter I have received, madame logician: each to her kind:--\n\n  \"Louise, it is not for your peerless beauty I love you, nor for\n  your gifted mind, your noble feeling, the wondrous charm of all\n  you say and do, nor yet for your pride, your queenly scorn of\n  baser mortals--a pride blent in you with charity, for what angel\n  could be more tender?--Louise, I love you because, for the sake of\n  a poor exile, you have unbent this lofty majesty, because by a\n  gesture, a glance, you have brought consolation to a man so far\n  beneath you that the utmost he could hope for was your pity, the\n  pity of a generous heart. You are the one woman whose eyes have\n  shone with a tenderer light when bent on me.\n\n  \"And because you let fall this glance--a mere grain of dust, yet a\n  grace surpassing any bestowed on me when I stood at the summit of\n  a subject's ambition--I long to tell you, Louise, how dear you are\n  to me, and that my love is for yourself alone, without a thought\n  beyond, a love that far more than fulfils the conditions laid down\n  by you for an ideal passion.\n\n  \"Know, then, idol of my highest heaven, that there is in the world\n  an offshoot of the Saracen race, whose life is in your hands, who\n  will receive your orders as a slave, and deem it an honor to\n  execute them. I have given myself to you absolutely and for the\n  mere joy of giving, for a single glance of your eye, for a touch\n  of the hand which one day you offered to your Spanish master. I am\n  but your servitor, Louise; I claim no more.\n\n  \"No, I dare not think that I could ever be loved; but perchance my\n  devotion may win for me toleration. Since that morning when you\n  smiled upon me with generous girlish impulse, divining the misery\n  of my lonely and rejected heart, you reign there alone. You are\n  the absolute ruler of my life, the queen of my thoughts, the god\n  of my heart; I find you in the sunshine of my home, the fragrance\n  of my flowers, the balm of the air I breathe, the pulsing of my\n  blood, the light that visits me in sleep.\n\n  \"One thought alone troubled this happiness--your ignorance. All\n  unknown to you was this boundless devotion, the trusty arm, the\n  blind slave, the silent tool, the wealth--for henceforth all I\n  possess is mine only as a trust--which lay at your disposal;\n  unknown to you, the heart waiting to receive your confidence, and\n  yearning to replace all that your life (I know it well) has lacked\n  --the liberal ancestress, so ready to meet your needs, a father to\n  whom you could look for protection in every difficulty, a friend,\n  a brother. The secret of your isolation is no secret to me! If I\n  am bold, it is because I long that you should know how much is\n  yours.\n\n  \"Take all, Louise, and is so doing bestow on me the one life\n  possible for me in this world--the life of devotion. In placing\n  the yoke on my neck, you run no risk; I ask nothing but the joy of\n  knowing myself yours. Needless even to say you will never love me;\n  it cannot be otherwise. I must love you from afar, without hope,\n  without reward beyond my own love.\n\n  \"In my anxiety to know whether you will accept me as your servant,\n  I have racked my brain to find some way in which you may\n  communicate with me without any danger of compromising yourself.\n  Injury to your self-respect there can be none in sanctioning a\n  devotion which has been yours for many days without your\n  knowledge. Let this, then, be the token. At the opera this\n  evening, if you carry in your hand a bouquet consisting of one red\n  and one white camellia--emblem of a man's blood at the service of\n  the purity he worships--that will be my answer. I ask no more;\n  thenceforth, at any moment, ten years hence or to-morrow, whatever\n  you demand shall be done, so far as it is possible for man to do\n  it, by your happy servant,\n\n  \"FELIPE HENAREZ.\"\n\n_P. S._--You must admit, dear, that great lords know how to love! See\nthe spring of the African lion! What restrained fire! What loyalty! What\nsincerity! How high a soul in low estate! I felt quite small and dazed\nas I said to myself, \"What shall I do?\"\n\nIt is the mark of a great man that he puts to flight all ordinary\ncalculations. He is at once sublime and touching, childlike and of the\nrace of giants. In a single letter Henarez has outstripped volumes from\nLovelace or Saint-Preux. Here is true love, no beating about the bush.\nLove may be or it may not, but where it is, it ought to reveal itself in\nits immensity.\n\nHere am I, shorn of all my little arts! To refuse or accept! That is the\nalternative boldly presented me, without the ghost of an opening for a\nmiddle course. No fencing allowed! This is no longer Paris; we are in\nthe heart of Spain or the far East. It is the voice of Abencerrage,\nand it is the scimitar, the horse, and the head of Abencerrage which\nhe offers, prostrate before a Catholic Eve! Shall I accept this last\ndescendant of the Moors? Read again and again his Hispano-Saracenic\nletter, Renee dear, and you will see how love makes a clean sweep of all\nthe Judaic bargains of your philosophy.\n\nRenee, your letter lies heavy on my heart; you have vulgarized life for\nme. What need have I for finessing? Am I not mistress for all time of\nthis lion whose roar dies out in plaintive and adoring sighs? Ah! how he\nmust have raged in his lair of the Rue Hillerin-Bertin! I know where he\nlives, I have his card: _F., Baron de Macumer_.\n\nHe has made it impossible for me to reply. All I can do is to fling\ntwo camellias in his face. What fiendish arts does love possess--pure,\nhonest, simple-minded love! Here is the most tremendous crisis of a\nwoman's heart resolved into an easy, simple action. Oh, Asia! I have\nread the _Arabian Nights_, here is their very essence: two flowers,\nand the question is settled. We clear the fourteen volumes of _Clarissa\nHarlowe_ with a bouquet. I writhe before this letter, like a thread in\nthe fire. To take, or not to take, my two camellias. Yes or No, kill or\ngive life! At last a voice cries to me, \"Test him!\" And I will test him.\n\n\n\n\nXVI. THE SAME TO THE SAME March.\n\nI am dressed in white--white camellias in my hair, and another in my\nhand. My mother has red camellias; so it would not be impossible to\ntake one from her--if I wished! I have a strange longing to put off the\ndecision to the last moment, and make him pay for his red camellia by a\nlittle suspense.\n\nWhat a vision of beauty! Griffith begged me to stop for a little and\nbe admired. The solemn crisis of the evening and the drama of my secret\nreply have given me a color; on each cheek I sport a red camellia laid\nupon a white!\n\n1 A. M.\n\nEverybody admired me, but only one adored. He hung his head as I entered\nwith a white camellia, but turned pale as the flower when, later, I took\na red one from my mother's hand. To arrive with the two flowers might\npossibly have been accidental; but this deliberate action was a reply.\nMy confession, therefore, is fuller than it need have been.\n\nThe opera was _Romeo and Juliet_. As you don't know the duet of the two\nlovers, you can't understand the bliss of two neophytes in love, as they\nlisten to this divine outpouring of the heart.\n\nOn returning home I went to bed, but only to count the steps which\nresounded on the sidewalk. My heart and head, darling, are all on fire\nnow. What is he doing? What is he thinking of? Has he a thought, a\nsingle thought, that is not of me? Is he, in very truth, the devoted\nslave he painted himself? How to be sure? Or, again, has it ever entered\nhis head that, if I accept him, I lay myself open to the shadow of a\nreproach or am in any sense rewarding or thanking him? I am harrowed by\nthe hair-splitting casuistry of the heroines in _Cyrus_ and _Astraea_,\nby all the subtle arguments of the court of love.\n\nHas he any idea that, in affairs of love, a woman's most trifling\nactions are but the issue of long brooding and inner conflicts, of\nvictories won only to be lost! What are his thoughts at this moment? How\ncan I give him my orders to write every evening the particulars of the\nday just gone? He is my slave whom I ought to keep busy. I shall deluge\nhim with work!\n\nSunday Morning.\n\nOnly towards morning did I sleep a little. It is midday now. I have just\ngot Griffith to write the following letter:\n\n  \"_To the Baron de Macumer_.\n\n  \"Mademoiselle de Chaulieu begs me, Monsieur le Baron, to ask you\n  to return to her the copy of a letter written to her by a friend,\n  which is in her own handwriting, and which you carried away.--\n  Believe me, etc.,\n\n  \"GRIFFITH.\"\n\nMy dear, Griffith has gone out; she has gone to the Rue Hillerin-Bertin;\nshe had handed in this little love-letter for my slave, who returned to\nme in an envelope my sweet portrait, stained with tears. He has obeyed.\nOh! my sweet, it must have been dear to him! Another man would have\nrefused to send it in a letter full of flattery; but the Saracen has\nfulfilled his promises. He has obeyed. It moves me to tears.\n\n\n\n\nXVII. THE SAME TO THE SAME April 2nd.\n\nYesterday the weather was splendid. I dressed myself like a girl who\nwants to look her best in her sweetheart's eyes. My father, yielding\nto my entreaties, has given me the prettiest turnout in Paris--two\ndapple-gray horses and a barouche, which is a masterpiece of elegance.\nI was making a first trial of this, and peeped out like a flower from\nunder my sunshade lined with white silk.\n\nAs I drove up the avenue of the Champs-Elysees, I saw my Abencerrage\napproaching on an extraordinarily beautiful horse. Almost every man\nnowadays is a finished jockey, and they all stopped to admire and\ninspect it. He bowed to me, and on receiving a friendly sign of\nencouragement, slackened his horse's pace so that I was able to say to\nhim:\n\n\"You are not vexed with me for asking for my letter; it was no use to\nyou.\" Then in a lower voice, \"You have already transcended the ideal.\n... Your horse makes you an object of general interest,\" I went on\naloud.\n\n\"My steward in Sardinia sent it to me. He is very proud of it; for this\nhorse, which is of Arab blood, was born in my stables.\"\n\nThis morning, my dear, Henarez was on an English sorrel, also very fine,\nbut not such as to attract attention. My light, mocking words had done\ntheir work. He bowed to me and I replied with a slight inclination of\nthe head.\n\nThe Duc d'Angouleme has bought Macumer's horse. My slave understood that\nhe was deserting the role of simplicity by attracting the notice of the\ncrowd. A man ought to be remarked for what he is, not for his horse, or\nanything else belonging to him. To have too beautiful a horse seems to\nme a piece of bad taste, just as much as wearing a huge diamond pin. I\nwas delighted at being able to find fault with him. Perhaps there may\nhave been a touch of vanity in what he did, very excusable in a poor\nexile, and I like to see this childishness.\n\nOh! my dear old preacher, do my love affairs amuse you as much as\nyour dismal philosophy gives me the creeps? Dear Philip the Second in\npetticoats, are you comfortable in my barouche? Do you see those velvet\neyes, humble, yet so eloquent, and glorying in their servitude, which\nflash on me as some one goes by? He is a hero, Renee, and he wears my\nlivery, and always a red camellia in his buttonhole, while I have always\na white one in my hand.\n\nHow clear everything becomes in the light of love! How well I know my\nParis now! It is all transfused with meaning. And love here is lovelier,\ngrander, more bewitching than elsewhere.\n\nI am convinced now that I could never flirt with a fool or make any\nimpression on him. It is only men of real distinction who can enter into\nour feelings and feel our influence. Oh! my poor friend, forgive me. I\nforgot our l'Estorade. But didn't you tell me you were going to make a\ngenius of him? I know what that means. You will dry nurse him till some\nday he is able to understand you.\n\nGood-bye. I am a little off my head, and must stop.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII. MME. DE L'ESTORADE TO LOUISE DE CHAULIEU April.\n\nMy angel--or ought I not rather to say my imp of evil?--you have,\nwithout meaning it, grieved me sorely. I would say wounded were we not\none soul. And yet it is possible to wound oneself.\n\nHow plain it is that you have never realized the force of the word\n_indissoluble_ as applied to the contract binding man and woman! I\nhave no wish to controvert what has been laid down by philosophers or\nlegislators--they are quite capable of doing this for themselves--but,\ndear one, in making marriage irrevocable and imposing on it a relentless\nformula, which admits of no exceptions, they have rendered each union\na thing as distinct as one individual is from another. Each has its\nown inner laws which differ from those of others. The laws regulating\nmarried life in the country, for instance, cannot be the same as those\nregulating a household in town, where frequent distractions give variety\nto life. Or conversely, married life in Paris, where existence is one\nperpetual whirl, must demand different treatment from the more peaceful\nhome in the provinces.\n\nBut if place alters the conditions of marriage, much more does\ncharacter. The wife of a man born to be a leader need only resign\nherself to his guidance; whereas the wife of a fool, conscious of\nsuperior power, is bound to take the reins in her own hand if she would\navert calamity.\n\nYou speak of vice; and it is possible that, after all, reason and\nreflection produce a result not dissimilar from what we call by that\nname. For what does a woman mean by it but perversion of feeling through\ncalculation? Passion is vicious when it reasons, admirable only when it\nsprings from the heart and spends itself in sublime impulses that set\nat naught all selfish considerations. Sooner or later, dear one, you too\nwill say, \"Yes! dissimulation is the necessary armor of a woman, if by\ndissimulation be meant courage to bear in silence, prudence to foresee\nthe future.\"\n\nEvery married woman learns to her cost the existence of certain social\nlaws, which, in many respects, conflict with the laws of nature.\nMarrying at our age, it would be possible to have a dozen children. What\nis this but another name for a dozen crimes, a dozen misfortunes? It\nwould be handing over to poverty and despair twelve innocent darlings;\nwhereas two children would mean the happiness of both, a double\nblessing, two lives capable of developing in harmony with the customs\nand laws of our time. The natural law and the code are in hostility,\nand we are the battle ground. Would you give the name of vice to the\nprudence of the wife who guards her family from destruction through its\nown acts? One calculation or a thousand, what matter, if the decision no\nlonger rests with the heart?\n\nAnd of this terrible calculation you will be guilty some day, my noble\nBaronne de Macumer, when you are the proud and happy wife of the man who\nadores you; or rather, being a man of sense, he will spare you by making\nit himself. (You see, dear dreamer, that I have studied the code in its\nbearings on conjugal relations.) And when at last that day comes, you\nwill understand that we are answerable only to God and to ourselves for\nthe means we employ to keep happiness alight in the heart of our homes.\nFar better is the calculation which succeeds in this than the reckless\npassion which introduces trouble, heart-burnings, and dissension.\n\nI have reflected painfully on the duties of a wife and mother of a\nfamily. Yes, sweet one, it is only by a sublime hypocrisy that we can\nattain the noblest ideal of a perfect woman. You tax me with insincerity\nbecause I dole out to Louis, from day to day, the measure of his\nintimacy with me; but is it not too close an intimacy which provokes\nrupture? My aim is to give him, in the very interest of his happiness,\nmany occupations, which will all serve as distractions to his love; and\nthis is not the reasoning of passion. If affection be inexhaustible,\nit is not so with love: the task, therefore, of a woman--truly no light\none--is to spread it out thriftily over a lifetime.\n\nAt the risk of exciting your disgust, I must tell you that I persist in\nthe principles I have adopted, and hold myself both heroic and generous\nin so doing. Virtue, my pet, is an abstract idea, varying in\nits manifestations with the surroundings. Virtue in Provence, in\nConstantinople, in London, and in Paris bears very different fruit, but\nis none the less virtue. Each human life is a substance compacted of\nwidely dissimilar elements, though, viewed from a certain height, the\ngeneral effect is the same.\n\nIf I wished to make Louis unhappy and to bring about a separation, all\nI need do is to leave the helm in his hands. I have not had your good\nfortune in meeting with a man of the highest distinction, but I may\nperhaps have the satisfaction of helping him on the road to it. Five\nyears hence let us meet in Paris and see! I believe we shall succeed\nin mystifying you. You will tell me then that I was quite mistaken, and\nthat M. de l'Estorade is a man of great natural gifts.\n\nAs for this brave love, of which I know only what you tell me, these\ntremors and night watches by starlight on the balcony, this idolatrous\nworship, this deification of woman--I knew it was not for me. You can\nenlarge the borders of your brilliant life as you please; mine is hemmed\nin to the boundaries of La Crampade.\n\nAnd you reproach me for the jealous care which alone can nurse this\nmodest and fragile shoot into a wealth of lasting and mysterious\nhappiness! I believed myself to have found out how to adapt the charm of\na mistress to the position of a wife, and you have almost made me blush\nfor my device. Who shall say which of us is right, which is wrong?\nPerhaps we are both right and both wrong. Perhaps this is the heavy\nprice which society exacts for our furbelows, our titles, and our\nchildren.\n\nI too have my red camellias, but they bloom on my lips in smiles for my\ndouble charge--the father and the son--whose slave and mistress I am.\nBut, my dear, your last letters made me feel what I have lost! You have\ntaught me all a woman sacrifices in marrying. One single glance did\nI take at those beautiful wild plateaus where you range at your sweet\nwill, and I will not tell you the tears that fell as I read. But regret\nis not remorse, though it may be first cousin to it.\n\nYou say, \"Marriage has made you a philosopher!\" Alas! bitterly did I\nfeel how far this was from the truth, as I wept to think of you swept\naway on love's torrent. But my father has made me read one of the\nprofoundest thinkers of these parts, the man on whom the mantle of\nBoussuet has fallen, one of those hard-headed theorists whose words\nforce conviction. While you were reading _Corinne_, I conned Bonald; and\nhere is the whole secret of my philosophy. He revealed to me the Family\nin its strength and holiness. According to Bonald, your father was right\nin his homily.\n\nFarewell, my dear fancy, my friend, my wild other self.\n\n\n\n\nXIX. LOUISE DE CHAULIEU TO MME. DE L'ESTORADE\n\nWell, my Renee, you are a love of a woman, and I quite agree now that we\ncan only be virtuous by cheating. Will that satisfy you? Moreover, the\nman who loves us is our property; we can make a fool or a genius of him\nas we please; only, between ourselves, the former happens more commonly.\nYou will make yours a genius, and you won't tell the secret--there are\ntwo heroic actions, if you will!\n\nAh! if there were no future life, how nicely you would be sold, for this\nis martyrdom into which you are plunging of your own accord. You want to\nmake him ambitious and to keep him in love! Child that you are, surely\nthe last alone is sufficient.\n\nTell me, to what point is calculation a virtue, or virtue calculation?\nYou won't say? Well, we won't quarrel over that, since we have Bonald to\nrefer to. We are, and intend to remain, virtuous; nevertheless at this\nmoment I believe that you, with all your pretty little knavery, are a\nbetter woman than I am.\n\nYes, I am shockingly deceitful. I love Felipe, and I conceal it from him\nwith an odious hypocrisy. I long to see him leap from his tree to the\ntop of the wall, and from the wall to my balcony--and if he did, how I\nshould wither him with my scorn! You see, I am frank enough with you.\n\nWhat restrains me? Where is the mysterious power which prevents me from\ntelling Felipe, dear fellow, how supremely happy he has made me by\nthe outpouring of his love--so pure, so absolute, so boundless, so\nunobtrusive, and so overflowing?\n\nMme. de Mirbel is painting my portrait, and I intend to give it to him,\nmy dear. What surprises me more and more every day is the animation\nwhich love puts into life. How full of interest is every hour, every\naction, every trifle! and what amazing confusion between the past, the\nfuture, and the present! One lives in three tenses at once. Is it still\nso after the heights of happiness are reached? Oh! tell me, I implore\nyou, what is happiness? Does it soothe, or does it excite? I am horribly\nrestless; I seem to have lost all my bearings; a force in my heart drags\nme to him, spite of reason and spite of propriety. There is this gain,\nthat I am better able to enter into your feelings.\n\nFelipe's happiness consists in feeling himself mine; the aloofness of\nhis love, his strict obedience, irritate me, just as his attitude of\nprofound respect provoked me when he was only my Spanish master. I am\ntempted to cry out to him as he passes, \"Fool, if you love me so much as\na picture, what will it be when you know the real me?\"\n\nOh! Renee, you burn my letters, don't you? I will burn yours. If other\neyes than ours were to read these thoughts which pass from heart to\nheart, I should send Felipe to put them out, and perhaps to kill the\nowners, by way of additional security.\n\nMonday.\n\nOh! Renee, how is it possible to fathom the heart of man? My father\nought to introduce me to M. Bonald, since he is so learned; I would ask\nhim. I envy the privilege of God, who can read the undercurrents of the\nheart.\n\nDoes he still worship? That is the whole question.\n\nIf ever, in gesture, glance, or tone, I were to detect the slightest\nfalling off in the respect he used to show me in the days when he was\nmy instructor in Spanish, I feel that I should have strength to put the\nwhole thing from me. \"Why these fine words, these grand resolutions?\"\nyou will say. Dear, I will tell you.\n\nMy fascinating father, who treats me with the devotion of an Italian\n_cavaliere servente_ for his lady, had my portrait painted, as I told\nyou, by Mme. de Mirbel. I contrived to get a copy made, good enough\nto do for the Duke, and sent the original to Felipe. I despatched it\nyesterday, and these lines with it:\n\n  \"Don Felipe, your single-hearted devotion is met by a blind\n  confidence. Time will show whether this is not to treat a man as\n  more than human.\"\n\nIt was a big reward. It looked like a promise and--dreadful to say--a\nchallenge; but--which will seem to you still more dreadful--I quite\nintended that it should suggest both these things, without going so far\nas actually to commit me. If in his reply there is \"Dear Louise!\" or\neven \"Louise,\" he is done for!\n\nTuesday.\n\nNo, he is not done for. The constitutional minister is perfect as a\nlover. Here is his letter:--\n\n  \"Every moment passed away from your sight has been filled by me\n  with ideal pictures of you, my eyes closed to the outside world\n  and fixed in meditation on your image, which used to obey the\n  summons too slowly in that dim palace of dreams, glorified by your\n  presence. Henceforth my gaze will rest upon this wondrous ivory--\n  this talisman, might I not say?--since your blue eyes sparkle with\n  life as I look, and paint passes into flesh and blood. If I have\n  delayed writing, it is because I could not tear myself away from\n  your presence, which wrung from me all that I was bound to keep\n  most secret.\n\n  \"Yes, closeted with you all last night and to-day, I have, for the\n  first time in my life, given myself up to full, complete, and\n  boundless happiness. Could you but see yourself where I have\n  placed you, between the Virgin and God, you might have some idea\n  of the agony in which the night has passed. But I would not offend\n  you by speaking of it; for one glance from your eyes, robbed of\n  the tender sweetness which is my life, would be full of torture\n  for me, and I implore your clemency therefore in advance. Queen of\n  my life and of my soul, oh! that you could grant me but one-\n  thousandth part of the love I bear you!\n\n  \"This was the burden of my prayer; doubt worked havoc in my soul\n  as I oscillated between belief and despair, between life and\n  death, darkness and light. A criminal whose verdict hangs in the\n  balance is not more racked with suspense than I, as I own to my\n  temerity. The smile imaged on your lips, to which my eyes turned\n  ever and again, and alone able to calm the storm roused by the\n  dread of displeasing you. From my birth no one, not even my\n  mother, has smiled on me. The beautiful young girl who was\n  designed for me rejected my heart and gave hers to my brother.\n  Again, in politics all my efforts have been defeated. In the eyes\n  of my king I have read only thirst for vengeance; from childhood\n  he has been my enemy, and the vote of the Cortes which placed me\n  in power was regarded by him as a personal insult.\n\n  \"Less than this might breed despondency in the stoutest heart.\n  Besides, I have no illusion; I know the gracelessness of my\n  person, and am well aware how difficult it is to do justice to the\n  heart within so rugged a shell. To be loved had ceased to be more\n  than a dream to me when I met you. Thus when I bound myself to\n  your service I knew that devotion alone could excuse my passion.\n\n  \"But, as I look upon this portrait and listen to your smile that\n  whispers of rapture, the rays of a hope which I had sternly\n  banished pierced the gloom, like the light of dawn, again to be\n  obscured by rising mists of doubt and fear of your displeasure, if\n  the morning should break to day. No, it is impossible you should\n  love me yet--I feel it; but in time, as you make proof of the\n  strength, the constancy, and depth of my affection, you may yield\n  me some foothold in your heart. If my daring offends you, tell me\n  so without anger, and I will return to my former part. But if you\n  consent to try and love me, be merciful and break it gently to one\n  who has placed the happiness of his life in the single thought of\n  serving you.\"\n\nMy dear, as I read these last words, he seemed to rise before me,\npale as the night when the camellias told their story and he knew his\noffering was accepted. These words, in their humility, were clearly\nsomething quite different from the usual flowery rhetoric of lovers, and\na wave of feeling broke over me; it was the breath of happiness.\n\nThe weather has been atrocious; impossible to go to the Bois without\nexciting all sorts of suspicions. Even my mother, who often goes out,\nregardless of rain, remains at home, and alone.\n\nWednesday evening.\n\nI have just seen _him_ at the Opera, my dear; he is another man. He came\nto our box, introduced by the Sardinian ambassador.\n\nHaving read in my eyes that this audacity was taken in good part, he\nseemed awkwardly conscious of his limbs, and addressed the Marquise\nd'Espard as \"mademoiselle.\" A light far brighter than the glare of the\nchandeliers flashed from his eyes. At last he went out with the air of a\nman who didn't know what he might do next.\n\n\"The Baron de Macumer is in love!\" exclaimed Mme. de Maufrigneuse.\n\n\"Strange, isn't it, for a fallen minister?\" replied my mother.\n\nI had sufficient presence of mind myself to regard with curiosity Mmes.\nde Maufrigneuse and d'Espard and my mother, as though they were talking\na foreign language and I wanted to know what it was all about, but\ninwardly my soul sank in the waves of an intoxicating joy. There is\nonly one word to express what I felt, and that is: rapture. Such love\nas Felipe's surely makes him worthy of mine. I am the very breath of\nhis life, my hands hold the thread that guides his thoughts. To be quite\nfrank, I have a mad longing to see him clear every obstacle and stand\nbefore me, asking boldly for my hand. Then I should know whether this\nstorm of love would sink to placid calm at a glance from me.\n\nAh! my dear, I stopped here, and I am still all in a tremble. As I\nwrote, I heard a slight noise outside, and rose to see what it was. From\nmy window I could see him coming along the ridge of the wall at the risk\nof his life. I went to the bedroom window and made him a sign, it was\nenough; he leaped from the wall--ten feet--and then ran along the road,\nas far as I could see him, in order to show me that he was not hurt.\nThat he should think of my fear at the moment when he must have been\nstunned by his fall, moved me so much that I am still crying; I don't\nknow why. Poor ungainly man! what was he coming for? what had he to say\nto me?\n\nI dare not write my thoughts, and shall go to bed joyful, thinking of\nall that we would say if we were together. Farewell, fair silent one. I\nhave not time to scold you for not writing, but it is more than a month\nsince I have heard from you! Does this mean that you are at last happy?\nHave you lost the \"complete independence\" which you were so proud of,\nand which to-night has so nearly played me false?\n\n\n\n\nXX. RENEE DE L'ESTORADE TO LOUISE DE CHAULIEU May.\n\nIf love be the life of the world, why do austere philosophers count it\nfor nothing in marriage? Why should Society take for its first law that\nthe woman must be sacrificed to the family, introducing thus a note of\ndiscord into the very heart of marriage? And this discord was foreseen,\nsince it was to meet the dangers arising from it that men were armed\nwith new-found powers against us. But for these, we should have been\nable to bring their whole theory to nothing, whether by the force of\nlove or of a secret, persistent aversion.\n\nI see in marriage, as it at present exists, two opposing forces which\nit was the task of the lawgiver to reconcile. \"When will they be\nreconciled?\" I said to myself, as I read your letter. Oh! my dear, one\nsuch letter alone is enough to overthrow the whole fabric constructed by\nthe sage of Aveyron, under whose shelter I had so cheerfully ensconced\nmyself! The laws were made by old men--any woman can see that--and\nthey have been prudent enough to decree that conjugal love, apart from\npassion, is not degrading, and that a woman in yielding herself may\ndispense with the sanction of love, provided the man can legally call\nher his. In their exclusive concern for the family they have imitated\nNature, whose one care is to propagate the species.\n\nFormerly I was a person, now I am a chattel. Not a few tears have I\ngulped down, alone and far from every one. How gladly would I have\nexchanged them for a consoling smile! Why are our destinies so unequal?\nYour soul expands in the atmosphere of a lawful passion. For you, virtue\nwill coincide with pleasure. If you encounter pain, it will be of your\nown free choice. Your duty, if you marry Felipe, will be one with the\nsweetest, freest indulgence of feeling. Our future is big with the\nanswer to my question, and I look for it with restless eagerness.\n\nYou love and are adored. Oh! my dear, let this noble romance, the\nold subject of our dreams, take full possession of your soul. Womanly\nbeauty, refined and spiritualized in you, was created by God, for His\nown purposes, to charm and to delight. Yes, my sweet, guard well the\nsecret of your heart, and submit Felipe to those ingenious devices of\nours for testing a lover's metal. Above all, make trial of your own\nlove, for this is even more important. It is so easy to be misled by\nthe deceptive glamour of novelty and passion, and by the vision of\nhappiness.\n\nAlone of the two friends, you remain in your maiden independence; and\nI beseech you, dearest, do not risk the irrevocable step of marriage\nwithout some guarantee. It happens sometimes, when two are talking\ntogether, apart from the world, their souls stripped of social disguise,\nthat a gesture, a word, a look lights up, as by a flash, some dark\nabyss. You have courage and strength to tread boldly in paths where\nothers would be lost.\n\nYou have no conception in what anxiety I watch you. Across all this\nspace I see you; my heart beats with yours. Be sure, therefore, to write\nand tell me everything. Your letters create an inner life of passion\nwithin my homely, peaceful household, which reminds me of a level\nhighroad on a gray day. The only event here, my sweet, is that I am\nplaying cross-purposes with myself. But I don't want to tell you about\nit just now; it must wait for another day. With dogged obstinacy, I pass\nfrom despair to hope, now yielding, now holding back. It may be that\nI ask from life more than we have a right to claim. In youth we are so\nready to believe that the ideal and the real will harmonize!\n\nI have been pondering alone, seated beneath a rock in my park, and the\nfruit of my pondering is that love in marriage is a happy accident on\nwhich it is impossible to base a universal law. My Aveyron philosopher\nis right in looking on the family as the only possible unit in society,\nand in placing woman in subjection to the family, as she has been in all\nages. The solution of this great--for us almost awful--question lies in\nour first child. For this reason, I would gladly be a mother, were it\nonly to supply food for the consuming energy of my soul.\n\nLouis' temper remains as perfect as ever; his love is of the active, my\ntenderness of the passive, type. He is happy, plucking the flowers which\nbloom for him, without troubling about the labor of the earth which has\nproduced them. Blessed self-absorption! At whatever cost to myself, I\nfall in with his illusions, as a mother, in my idea of her, should be\nready to spend herself to satisfy a fancy of her child. The intensity of\nhis joy blinds him, and even throws its reflection upon me. The smile\nor look of satisfaction which the knowledge of his content brings to my\nface is enough to satisfy him. And so, \"my child\" is the pet name which\nI give him when we are alone.\n\nAnd I wait for the fruit of all these sacrifices which remain a secret\nbetween God, myself, and you. On motherhood I have staked enormously;\nmy credit account is now too large, I fear I shall never receive full\npayment. To it I look for employment of my energy, expansion of my\nheart, and the compensation of a world of joys. Pray Heaven I be not\ndeceived! It is a question of all my future and, horrible thought, of my\nvirtue.\n\n\n\n\nXXI. LOUISE DE CHAULIEU TO RENEE DE L'ESTORADE June.\n\nDear wedded sweetheart,--Your letter has arrived at the very moment to\nhearten me for a bold step which I have been meditating night and day.\nI feel within me a strange craving for the unknown, or, if you will, the\nforbidden, which makes me uneasy and reveals a conflict in progress in\nmy soul between the laws of society and of nature. I cannot tell whether\nnature in me is the stronger of the two, but I surprise myself in the\nact of meditating between the hostile powers.\n\nIn plain words, what I wanted was to speak with Felipe, alone, at night,\nunder the lime-trees at the bottom of our garden. There is no denying\nthat this desire beseems the girl who has earned the epithet of an\n\"up-to-date young lady,\" bestowed on me by the Duchess in jest, and\nwhich my father has approved.\n\nYet to me there seems a method in this madness. I should recompense\nFelipe for the long nights he has passed under my window, at the same\ntime that I should test him, by seeing what he thinks of my escapade and\nhow he comports himself at a critical moment. Let him cast a halo round\nmy folly--behold in him my husband; let him show one iota\nless of the tremulous respect with which he bows to me in the\nChamps-Elysees--farewell, Don Felipe.\n\nAs for society, I run less risk in meeting my lover thus than when I\nsmile to him in the drawing-rooms of Mme. de Maufrigneuse and the old\nMarquise de Beauseant, where spies now surround us on every side; and\nHeaven only knows how people stare at the girl, suspected of a weakness\nfor a grotesque, like Macumer.\n\nI cannot tell you to what a state of agitation I am reduced by dreaming\nof this idea, and the time I have given to planning its execution. I\nwanted you badly. What happy hours we should have chattered away, lost\nin the mazes of uncertainty, enjoying in anticipation all the delights\nand horrors of a first meeting in the silence of night, under the noble\nlime-trees of the Chaulieu mansion, with the moonlight dancing through\nthe leaves! As I sat alone, every nerve tingling, I cried, \"Oh! Renee,\nwhere are you?\" Then your letter came, like a match to gunpowder, and my\nlast scruples went by the board.\n\nThrough the window I tossed to my bewildered adorer an exact tracing of\nthe key of the little gate at the end of the garden, together with this\nnote:\n\n  \"Your madness must really be put a stop to. If you broke your\n  neck, you would ruin the reputation of the woman you profess to\n  love. Are you worthy of a new proof of regard, and do you deserve\n  that I should talk with you under the limes at the foot of the\n  garden at the hour when the moon throws them into shadow?\"\n\nYesterday at one o'clock, when Griffith was going to bed, I said to her:\n\n\"Take your shawl, dear, and come out with me. I want to go to the bottom\nof the garden without anyone knowing.\"\n\nWithout a word, she followed me. Oh! my Renee, what an awful moment\nwhen, after a little pause full of delicious thrills of agony, I saw him\ngliding along like a shadow. When he had reached the garden safely, I\nsaid to Griffith:\n\n\"Don't be astonished, but the Baron de Macumer is here, and, indeed, it\nis on that account I brought you with me.\"\n\nNo reply from Griffith.\n\n\"What would you have with me?\" said Felipe, in a tone of such agitation\nthat it was easy to see he was driven beside himself by the noise,\nslight as it was, of our dresses in the silence of the night and of our\nsteps upon the gravel.\n\n\"I want to say to you what I could not write,\" I replied.\n\nGriffith withdrew a few steps. It was one of those mild nights, when\nthe air is heavy with the scent of flowers. My head swam with the\nintoxicating delight of finding myself all but alone with him in the\nfriendly shade of the lime-trees, beyond which lay the garden, shining\nall the more brightly because the white facade of the house reflected\nthe moonlight. The contrast seemed, as it were, an emblem of our\nclandestine love leading up to the glaring publicity of a wedding.\nNeither of us could do more at first than drink in silently the ecstasy\nof a moment, as new and marvelous for him as for me. At last I found\ntongue to say, pointing to the elm-tree:\n\n\"Although I am not afraid of scandal, you shall not climb that tree\nagain. We have long enough played schoolboy and schoolgirl, let us rise\nnow to the height of our destiny. Had that fall killed you, I should\nhave died disgraced...\"\n\nI looked at him. Every scrap of color had left his face.\n\n\"And if you had been found there, suspicion would have attached either\nto my mother or to me...\"\n\n\"Forgive me,\" he murmured.\n\n\"If you walk along the boulevard, I shall hear your step; and when I\nwant to see you, I will open my window. But I would not run such a risk\nunless some emergency arose. Why have you forced me by your rash act to\ncommit another, and one which may lower me in your eyes?\"\n\nThe tears which I saw in his eyes were to me the most eloquent of\nanswers.\n\n\"What I have done to-night,\" I went on with a smile, \"must seem to you\nthe height of madness...\"\n\nAfter we had walked up and down in silence more than once, he recovered\ncomposure enough to say:\n\n\"You must think me a fool; and, indeed, the delirium of my joy has\nrobbed me of both nerve and wits. But of this at least be assured,\nwhatever you do is sacred in my eyes from the very fact that it seemed\nright to you. I honor you as I honor only God besides. And then, Miss\nGriffith is here.\"\n\n\"She is here for the sake of the others, not for us,\" I put in hastily.\n\nMy dear, he understood me at once.\n\n\"I know very well,\" he said, with the humblest glance at me, \"that\nwhether she is there or not makes no difference. Unseen of men, we are\nstill in the presence of God, and our own esteem is not less important\nto us than that of the world.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Felipe,\" I said, holding out my hand to him with a gesture\nwhich you ought to see. \"A woman, and I am nothing, if not a woman,\nis on the road to loving the man who understands her. Oh! only on the\nroad,\" I went on, with a finger on my lips. \"Don't let your hopes carry\nyou beyond what I say. My heart will belong only to the man who can\nread it and know its every turn. Our views, without being absolutely\nidentical, must be the same in their breadth and elevation. I have no\nwish to exaggerate my own merits; doubtless what seem virtues in my\neyes have their corresponding defects. All I can say is, I should be\nheartbroken without them.\"\n\n\"Having first accepted me as your servant, you now permit me to love\nyou,\" he said, trembling and looking in my face at each word. \"My first\nprayer has been more than answered.\"\n\n\"But,\" I hastened to reply, \"your position seems to me a better one than\nmine. I should not object to change places, and this change it lies with\nyou to bring about.\"\n\n\"In my turn, I thank you,\" he replied. \"I know the duties of a faithful\nlover. It is mine to prove that I am worthy of you; the trials shall\nbe as long as you choose to make them. If I belie your hopes, you have\nonly--God! that I should say it--to reject me.\"\n\n\"I know that you love me,\" I replied. \"_So far_,\" with a cruel emphasis\non the words, \"you stand first in my regard. Otherwise you would not be\nhere.\"\n\nThen we began to walk up and down as we talked, and I must say that\nso soon as my Spaniard had recovered himself he put forth the genuine\neloquence of the heart. It was not passion it breathed, but a marvelous\ntenderness of feeling which he beautifully compared to the divine\nlove. His thrilling voice, which lent an added charm to thoughts, in\nthemselves so exquisite, reminded me of the nightingale's note. He spoke\nlow, using only the middle tones of a fine instrument, and words flowed\nupon words with the rush of a torrent. It was the overflow of the heart.\n\n\"No more,\" I said, \"or I shall not be able to tear myself away.\"\n\nAnd with a gesture I dismissed him.\n\n\"You have committed yourself now, mademoiselle,\" said Griffith.\n\n\"In England that might be so, but not in France,\" I replied with\nnonchalance. \"I intend to make a love match, and am feeling my way--that\nis all.\"\n\nYou see, dear, as love did not come to me, I had to do as Mahomet did\nwith the mountain.\n\nFriday.\n\nOnce more I have seen my slave. He has become very timid, and puts on an\nair of pious devotion, which I like, for it seems to say that he feels\nmy power and fascination in every fibre. But nothing in his look or\nmanner can rouse in these society sibyls any suspicion of the boundless\nlove which I see. Don't suppose though, dear, that I am carried away,\nmastered, tamed; on the contrary, the taming, mastering, and carrying\naway are on my side...\n\nIn short, I am quite capable of reason. Oh! to feel again the terror of\nthat fascination in which I was held by the schoolmaster, the plebeian,\nthe man I kept at a distance!\n\nThe fact is that love is of two kinds--one which commands, and one which\nobeys. The two are quite distinct, and the passion to which the one\ngives rise is not the passion of the other. To get her full of life,\nperhaps a woman ought to have experience of both. Can the two passions\never co-exist? Can the man in whom we inspire love inspire it in us?\nWill the day ever come when Felipe is my master? Shall I tremble then,\nas he does now? These are questions which make me shudder.\n\nHe is very blind! In his place I should have thought Mlle. de Chaulieu,\nmeeting me under the limes, a cold, calculating coquette, with starched\nmanners. No, that is not love, it is playing with fire. I am still fond\nof Felipe, but I am calm and at my ease with him now. No more obstacles!\nWhat a terrible thought! It is all ebb-tide within, and I fear to\nquestion my heart. His mistake was in concealing the ardor of his love;\nhe ought to have forced my self-control.\n\nIn a word, I was naughty, and I have not got the reward such naughtiness\nbrings. No, dear, however sweet the memory of that half-hour beneath\nthe trees, it is nothing like the excitement of the old time with its:\n\"Shall I go? Shall I not go? Shall I write to him? Shall I not write?\"\n\nIs it thus with all our pleasures? Is suspense always better than\nenjoyment? Hope than fruition? Is it the rich who in very truth are\nthe poor? Have we not both perhaps exaggerated feeling by giving to\nimagination too free a rein? There are times when this thought freezes\nme. Shall I tell you why? Because I am meditating another visit to\nthe bottom of the garden--without Griffith. How far could I go in this\ndirection? Imagination knows no limit, but it is not so with pleasure.\nTell me, dear be-furbelowed professor, how can one reconcile the two\ngoals of a woman's existence?\n\n\n\n\nXXII. LOUISE TO FELIPE\n\nI am not pleased with you. If you did not cry over Racine's _Berenice_,\nand feel it to be the most terrible of tragedies, there is no kinship in\nour souls; we shall never get on together, and had better break off\nat once. Let us meet no more. Forget me; for if I do not have a\nsatisfactory reply, I shall forget you. You will become M. le Baron de\nMacumer for me, or rather you will cease to be at all.\n\nYesterday at Mme. d'Espard's you had a self-satisfied air which\ndisgusted me. No doubt, apparently, about your conquest! In sober\nearnest, your self-possession alarms me. Not a trace in you of\nthe humble slave of your first letter. Far from betraying the\nabsent-mindedness of a lover, you polished epigrams! This is not the\nattitude of a true believer, always prostrate before his divinity.\n\nIf you do not feel me to be the very breath of your life, a being nobler\nthan other women, and to be judged by other standards, then I must\nbe less than a woman in your sight. You have roused in me a spirit of\nmistrust, Felipe, and its angry mutterings have drowned the accents of\ntenderness. When I look back upon what has passed between us, I feel in\ntruth that I have a right to be suspicious. For know, Prime Minister of\nall the Spains, that I have reflected much on the defenceless condition\nof our sex. My innocence has held a torch, and my fingers are not burnt.\nLet me repeat to you, then, what my youthful experience taught me.\n\nIn all other matters, duplicity, faithlessness, and broken pledges are\nbrought to book and punished; but not so with love, which is at once the\nvictim, the accuser, the counsel, judge, and executioner. The cruelest\ntreachery, the most heartless crimes, are those which remain for ever\nconcealed, with two hearts alone for witness. How indeed should the\nvictim proclaim them without injury to herself? Love, therefore, has its\nown code, its own penal system, with which the world has no concern.\n\nNow, for my part, I have resolved never to pardon a serious misdemeanor,\nand in love, pray, what is not serious? Yesterday you had all the air of\na man successful in his suit. You would be wrong to doubt it; and yet,\nif this assurance robbed you of the charming simplicity which sprang\nfrom uncertainty, I should blame you severely. I would have you neither\nbashful nor self-complacent; I would not have you in terror of losing\nmy affection--that would be an insult--but neither would I have you wear\nyour love lightly as a thing of course. Never should your heart be freer\nthan mine. If you know nothing of the torture that a single stab of\ndoubt brings to the soul, tremble lest I give you a lesson!\n\nIn a single glance I confided my heart to you, and you read the meaning.\nThe purest feelings that ever took root in a young girl's breast are\nyours. The thought and meditation of which I have told you served only\nto enrich the mind; but if ever the wounded heart turns to the brain for\ncounsel, be sure the young girl would show some kinship with the demon\nof knowledge and of daring.\n\nI swear to you, Felipe, if you love me, as I believe you do and if I\nhave reason to suspect the least falling off in the fear, obedience, and\nrespect which you have hitherto professed, if the pure flame of passion\nwhich first kindled the fire of my heart should seem to me any day to\nburn less vividly, you need fear no reproaches. I would not weary you\nwith letters bearing any trace of weakness, pride, or anger, nor even\nwith one of warning like this. But if I spoke no words, Felipe, my face\nwould tell you that death was near. And yet I should not die till I\nhad branded you with infamy, and sown eternal sorrow in your heart; you\nwould see the girl you loved dishonored and lost in this world, and know\nher doomed to everlasting suffering in the next.\n\nDo not therefore, I implore you, give me cause to envy the old, happy\nLouise, the object of your pure worship, whose heart expanded in the\nsunshine of happiness, since, in the words of Dante, she possessed,\n\n  Senza brama, sicura ricchezza!\n\nI have searched the _Inferno_ through to find the most terrible\npunishment, some torture of the mind to which I might link the vengeance\nof God.\n\nYesterday, as I watched you, doubt went through me like a sharp, cold\ndagger's point. Do you know what that means? I mistrusted you, and the\npang was so terrible, I could not endure it longer. If my service be\ntoo hard, leave it, I would not keep you. Do I need any proof of your\ncleverness? Keep for me the flowers of your wit. Show to others no fine\nsurface to call forth flattery, compliments, or praise. Come to me,\nladen with hatred or scorn, the butt of calumny, come to me with the\nnews that women flout you and ignore you, and not one loves you; then,\nah! then you will know the treasures of Louise's heart and love.\n\nWe are only rich when our wealth is buried so deep that all the world\nmight trample it under foot, unknowing. If you were handsome, I don't\nsuppose I should have looked at you twice, or discovered one of the\nthousand reasons out of which my love sprang. True, we know no more of\nthese reasons than we know why it is the sun makes the flowers to bloom,\nand ripens the fruit. Yet I could tell you of one reason very dear to\nme.\n\nThe character, expression, and individuality that ennoble your face are\na sealed book to all but me. Mine is the power which transforms you into\nthe most lovable of men, and that is why I would keep your mental gifts\nalso for myself. To others they should be as meaningless as your eyes,\nthe charm of your mouth and features. Let it be mine alone to kindle the\nbeacon of your intelligence, as I bring the lovelight into your eyes.\nI would have you the Spanish grandee of old days, cold, ungracious,\nhaughty, a monument to be gazed at from afar, like the ruins of some\nbarbaric power, which no one ventures to explore. Now, you have nothing\nbetter to do than to open up pleasant promenades for the public, and\nshow yourself of a Parisian affability!\n\nIs my ideal portrait, then, forgotten? Your excessive cheerfulness was\nredolent of your love. Had it not been for a restraining glance from me,\nyou would have proclaimed to the most sharp-sighted, keen-witted,\nand unsparing of Paris salons, that your inspiration was drawn from\nArmande-Louise-Marie de Chaulieu.\n\nI believe in your greatness too much to think for a moment that your\nlove is ruled by policy; but if you did not show a childlike simplicity\nwhen with me, I could only pity you. Spite of this first fault, you are\nstill deeply admired by LOUISE DE CHAULIEU.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII. FELIPE TO LOUISE\n\nWhen God beholds our faults, He sees also our repentance. Yes, my\nbeloved mistress, you are right. I felt that I had displeased you, but\nknew not how. Now that you have explained the cause of your trouble, I\nfind in it fresh motive to adore you. Like the God of Israel, you are\na jealous deity, and I rejoice to see it. For what is holier and\nmore precious than jealousy? My fair guardian angel, jealousy is an\never-wakeful sentinel; it is to love what pain is to the body, the\nfaithful herald of evil. Be jealous of your servant, Louise, I beg of\nyou; the harder you strike, the more contrite will he be and kiss the\nrod, in all submission, which proves that he is not indifferent to you.\n\nBut, alas! dear, if the pains it cost me to vanquish my timidity and\nmaster feelings you thought so feeble were invisible to you, will\nHeaven, think you, reward them? I assure you, it needed no slight effort\nto show myself to you as I was in the days before I loved. At Madrid I\nwas considered a good talker, and I wanted you to see for yourself the\nfew gifts I may possess. If this were vanity, it has been well punished.\n\nYour last glance utterly unnerved me. Never had I so quailed, even when\nthe army of France was at the gates of Cadiz and I read peril for my\nlife in the dissembling words of my royal master. Vainly I tried to\ndiscover the cause of your displeasure, and the lack of sympathy between\nus which this fact disclosed was terrible to me. For in truth I have no\nwish but to act by your will, think your thoughts, see with your eyes,\nrespond to your joy and suffering, as my body responds to heat and cold.\nThe crime and the anguish lay for me in the breach of unison in that\ncommon life of feeling which you have made so fair.\n\n\"I have vexed her!\" I exclaimed over and over again, like one\ndistraught. My noble, my beautiful Louise, if anything could increase\nthe fervor of my devotion or confirm my belief in your delicate moral\nintuitions, it would be the new light which your words have thrown upon\nmy own feelings. Much in them, of which my mind was formerly but dimly\nconscious, you have now made clear. If this be designed as chastisement,\nwhat can be the sweetness of your rewards?\n\nLouise, for me it was happiness enough to be accepted as your servant.\nYou have given me the life of which I despaired. No longer do I draw a\nuseless breath, I have something to spend myself for; my force has an\noutlet, if only in suffering for you. Once more I say, as I have said\nbefore, that you will never find me other than I was when first I\noffered myself as your lowly bondman. Yes, were you dishonored and lost,\nto use your own words, my heart would only cling the more closely to you\nfor your self-sought misery. It would be my care to staunch your wounds,\nand my prayers should importune God with the story of your innocence and\nyour wrongs.\n\nDid I not tell you that the feelings of my heart for you are not a\nlover's only, that I will be to you father, mother, sister, brother--ay,\na whole family--anything or nothing, as you may decree? And is it not\nyour own wish which has confined within the compass of a lover's feeling\nso many varying forms of devotion? Pardon me, then, if at times the\nfather and brother disappear behind the lover, since you know they are\nnone the less there, though screened from view. Would that you could\nread the feelings of my heart when you appear before me, radiant in your\nbeauty, the centre of admiring eyes, reclining calmly in your carriage\nin the Champs-Elysees, or seated in your box at the Opera! Then would\nyou know how absolutely free from selfish taint is the pride with which\nI hear the praises of your loveliness and grace, praises which warm\nmy heart even to the strangers who utter them! When by chance you have\nraised me to elysium by a friendly greeting, my pride is mingled with\nhumility, and I depart as though God's blessing rested on me. Nor does\nthe joy vanish without leaving a long track of light behind. It breaks\non me through the clouds of my cigarette smoke. More than ever do I feel\nhow every drop of this surging blood throbs for you.\n\nCan you be ignorant how you are loved? After seeing you, I return to\nmy study, and the glitter of its Saracenic ornaments sinks to nothing\nbefore the brightness of your portrait, when I open the spring that\nkeeps it locked up from every eye and lose myself in endless musings or\nlink my happiness to verse. From the heights of heaven I look down\nupon the course of a life such as my hopes dare to picture it! Have you\nnever, in the silence of the night, or through the roar of the town,\nheard the whisper of a voice in your sweet, dainty ear? Does no one of\nthe thousand prayers that I speed to you reach home?\n\nBy dint of silent contemplation of your pictured face, I have succeeded\nin deciphering the expression of every feature and tracing its\nconnection with some grace of the spirit, and then I pen a sonnet to\nyou in Spanish on the harmony of the twofold beauty in which nature\nhas clothed you. These sonnets you will never see, for my poetry is too\nunworthy of its theme, I dare not send it to you. Not a moment passes\nwithout thoughts of you, for my whole being is bound up in you, and if\nyou ceased to be its animating principle, every part would ache.\n\nNow, Louise, can you realize the torture to me of knowing that I had\ndispleased you, while entirely ignorant of the cause? The ideal double\nlife which seemed so fair was cut short. My heart turned to ice within\nme as, hopeless of any other explanation, I concluded that you had\nceased to love me. With heavy heart, and yet not wholly without comfort,\nI was falling back upon my old post as servant; then your letter came\nand turned all to joy. Oh! might I but listen for ever to such chiding!\n\nOnce a child, picking himself up from a tumble, turned to his mother\nwith the words \"Forgive me.\" Hiding his own hurt, he sought pardon for\nthe pain he had caused her. Louise, I was that child, and such as I was\nthen, I am now. Here is the key to my character, which your slave in all\nhumility places in your hands.\n\nBut do not fear, there will be no more stumbling. Keep tight the chain\nwhich binds me to you, so that a touch may communicate your lightest\nwish to him who will ever remain your slave, FELIPE.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV. LOUISE DE CHAULIEU TO RENEE DE L'ESTORADE October.\n\nMy dear friend,--How is it possible that you, who brought yourself in\ntwo months to marry a broken-down invalid in order to mother him, should\nknow anything of that terrible shifting drama, enacted in the recesses\nof the heart, which we call love--a drama where death lies in a glance\nor a light reply?\n\nI had reserved for Felipe one last supreme test which was to be\ndecisive. I wanted to know whether his love was the love of a Royalist\nfor his King, who can do no wrong. Why should the loyalty of a Catholic\nbe less supreme?\n\nHe walked with me a whole night under the limes at the bottom of the\ngarden, and not a shadow of suspicion crossed his soul. Next day\nhe loved me better, but the feeling was as reverent, as humble, as\nregretful as ever; he had not presumed an iota. Oh! he is a very\nSpaniard, a very Abencerrage. He scaled my wall to come and kiss the\nhand which in the darkness I reached down to him from my balcony. He\nmight have broken his neck; how many of our young men would do the like?\n\nBut all this is nothing; Christians suffer the horrible pangs of\nmartyrdom in the hope of heaven. The day before yesterday I took aside\nthe royal ambassador-to-be at the court of Spain, my much respected\nfather, and said to him with a smile:\n\n\"Sir, some of your friends will have it that you are marrying your dear\nArmande to the nephew of an ambassador who has been very anxious\nfor this connection, and has long begged for it. Also, that the\nmarriage-contract arranges for his nephew to succeed on his death to his\nenormous fortune and his title, and bestows on the young couple in the\nmeantime an income of a hundred thousand livres, on the bride a dowry\nof eight hundred thousand francs. Your daughter weeps, but bows to the\nunquestioned authority of her honored parent. Some people are unkind\nenough to say that, behind her tears, she conceals a worldly and\nambitious soul.\n\n\"Now, we are going to the gentleman's box at the Opera to-night, and M.\nle Baron de Macumer will visit us there.\"\n\n\"Macumer needs a touch of the spur then,\" said my father, smiling at me,\nas though I were a female ambassador.\n\n\"You mistake Clarissa Harlowe for Figaro!\" I cried, with a glance of\nscorn and mockery. \"When you see me with my right hand ungloved,\nyou will give the lie to this impertinent gossip, and will mark your\ndispleasure at it.\"\n\n\"I may make my mind easy about your future. You have no more got a\ngirl's headpiece than Jeanne d'Arc had a woman's heart. You will be\nhappy, you will love nobody, and will allow yourself to be loved.\"\n\nThis was too much. I burst into laughter.\n\n\"What is it, little flirt?\" he said.\n\n\"I tremble for my country's interests...\"\n\nAnd seeing him look quite blank, I added:\n\n\"At Madrid!\"\n\n\"You have no idea how this little nun has learned, in a year's time, to\nmake fun of her father,\" he said to the Duchess.\n\n\"Armande makes light of everything,\" my mother replied, looking me in\nthe face.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why, you are not even afraid of rheumatism on these damp nights,\" she\nsaid, with another meaning glance at me.\n\n\"Oh!\" I answered, \"the mornings are so hot!\"\n\nThe Duchess looked down.\n\n\"It's high time she were married,\" said my father, \"and it had better be\nbefore I go.\"\n\n\"If you wish it,\" I replied demurely.\n\nTwo hours later, my mother and I, the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse and Mme.\nd'Espard, were all four blooming like roses in the front of the box. I\nhad seated myself sideways, giving only a shoulder to the house, so that\nI could see everything, myself unseen, in that spacious box which fills\none of the two angles at the back of the hall, between the columns.\n\nMacumer came, stood up, and put his opera-glasses before his eyes so\nthat he might be able to look at me comfortably.\n\nIn the first interval entered the young man whom I call \"king of the\nprofligates.\" The Comte Henri de Marsay, who has great beauty of an\neffeminate kind, entered the box with an epigram in his eyes, a smile\nupon his lips, and an air of satisfaction over his whole countenance.\nHe first greeted my mother, Mme. d'Espard, and the Duchesse de\nMaufrigneuse, the Comte d'Esgrignon, and M. de Canalis; then turning to\nme, he said:\n\n\"I do not know whether I shall be the first to congratulate you on an\nevent which will make you the object of envy to many.\"\n\n\"Ah! a marriage!\" I cried. \"Is it left for me, a girl fresh from the\nconvent, to tell you that predicted marriages never come off.\"\n\nM. de Marsay bent down, whispering to Macumer, and I was convinced, from\nthe movement of his lips, that what he said was this:\n\n\"Baron, you are perhaps in love with that little coquette, who has used\nyou for her own ends; but as the question is one not of love, but of\nmarriage, it is as well for you to know what is going on.\"\n\nMacumer treated this officious scandal-monger to one of those glances\nof his which seem to me so eloquent of noble scorn, and replied to the\neffect that he was \"not in love with any little coquette.\" His whole\nbearing so delighted me, that directly I caught sight of my father, the\nglove was off.\n\nFelipe had not a shadow of fear or doubt. How well did he bear out my\nexpectations! His faith is only in me, society cannot hurt him with its\nlies. Not a muscle of the Arab's face stirred, not a drop of the blue\nblood flushed his olive cheek.\n\nThe two young counts went out, and I said, laughing, to Macumer:\n\n\"M. de Marsay has been treating you to an epigram on me.\"\n\n\"He did more,\" he replied. \"It was an epithalamium.\"\n\n\"You speak Greek to me,\" I said, rewarding him with a smile and a\ncertain look which always embarrasses him.\n\nMy father meantime was talking to Mme. de Maufrigneuse.\n\n\"I should think so!\" he exclaimed. \"The gossip which gets about is\nscandalous. No sooner has a girl come out than everyone is keen to marry\nher, and the ridiculous stories that are invented! I shall never force\nArmande to marry against her will. I am going to take a turn in the\npromenade, otherwise people will be saying that I allowed the rumor to\nspread in order to suggest the marriage to the ambassador; and Caesar's\ndaughter ought to be above suspicion, even more than his wife--if that\nwere possible.\"\n\nThe Duchesse de Maufrigneuse and Mme. d'Espard shot glances first at\nmy mother, then at the Baron, brimming over with sly intelligence and\nrepressed curiosity. With their serpent's cunning they had at last got\nan inkling of something going on. Of all mysteries in life, love is the\nleast mysterious! It exhales from women, I believe, like a perfume, and\nshe who can conceal it is a very monster! Our eyes prattle even more\nthan our tongues.\n\nHaving enjoyed the delightful sensation of finding Felipe rise to the\noccasion, as I had wished, it was only in nature I should hunger for\nmore. So I made the signal agreed on for telling him that he might come\nto my window by the dangerous road you know of. A few hours later I\nfound him, upright as a statue, glued to the wall, his hand resting on\nthe balcony of my window, studying the reflections of the light in my\nroom.\n\n\"My dear Felipe,\" I said, \"You have acquitted yourself well to-night;\nyou behaved exactly as I should have done had I been told that you were\non the point of marrying.\"\n\n\"I thought,\" he replied, \"that you would hardly have told others before\nme.\"\n\n\"And what right have you to this privilege?\"\n\n\"The right of one who is your devoted slave.\"\n\n\"In very truth?\"\n\n\"I am, and shall ever remain so.\"\n\n\"But suppose this marriage was inevitable; suppose that I had agreed...\"\n\nTwo flashing glances lit up the moonlight--one directed to me, the other\nto the precipice which the wall made for us. He seemed to calculate\nwhether a fall together would mean death; but the thought merely passed\nlike lightning over his face and sparkled in his eyes. A power, stronger\nthan passion, checked the impulse.\n\n\"An Arab cannot take back his word,\" he said in a husky voice. \"I am\nyour slave to do with as you will; my life is not mine to destroy.\"\n\nThe hand on the balcony seemed as though its hold were relaxing. I\nplaced mine on it as I said:\n\n\"Felipe, my beloved, from this moment I am your wife in thought and\nwill. Go in the morning to ask my father for my hand. He wishes to\nretain my fortune; but if you promise to acknowledge receipt of it in\nthe contract, his consent will no doubt be given. I am no longer Armande\nde Chaulieu. Leave me at once; no breath of scandal must touch Louise de\nMacumer.\"\n\nHe listened with blanched face and trembling limbs, then, like a flash,\nhad cleared the ten feet to the ground in safety. It was a moment of\nagony, but he waved his hand to me and disappeared.\n\n\"I am loved then,\" I said to myself, \"as never woman was before.\" And I\nfell asleep in the calm content of a child, my destiny for ever fixed.\n\nAbout two o'clock next day my father summoned me to his private room,\nwhere I found the Duchess and Macumer. There was an interchange of\ncivilities. I replied quite simply that if my father and M. Henarez were\nof one mind, I had no reason to oppose their wishes. Thereupon my mother\ninvited the Baron to dinner; and after dinner, we all four went for\na drive in the Bois de Boulogne, where I had the pleasure of smiling\nironically to M. de Marsay as he passed on horseback and caught sight of\nMacumer sitting opposite to us beside my father.\n\nMy bewitching Felipe has had his cards reprinted as follows:\n\nHENAREZ\n\n(Baron de Macumer, formerly Duc de Soria.)\n\nEvery morning he brings me with his own hands a splendid bouquet, hidden\nin which I never fail to find a letter, containing a Spanish sonnet in\nmy honor, which he has composed during the night.\n\nNot to make this letter inordinately large, I send you as specimens only\nthe first and last of these sonnets, which I have translated for your\nbenefit, word for word, and line for line:--\n\nFIRST SONNET\n\n  Many a time I've stood, clad in thin silken vest,\n  Drawn sword in hand, with steady pulse,\n  Waiting the charge of a raging bull,\n  And the thrust of his horn, sharper-pointed than Phoebe's crescent.\n\n  I've scaled, on my lips the lilt of an Andalusian dance,\n  The steep redoubt under a rain of fire;\n  I've staked my life upon a hazard of the dice\n  Careless, as though it were a gold doubloon.\n\n  My hand would seek the ball out of the cannon's mouth,\n  But now meseems I grow more timid than a crouching hair,\n  Or a child spying some ghost in the curtain's folds.\n\n  For when your sweet eye rests on me,\n  Any icy sweat covers my brow, my knees give way,\n  I tremble, shrink, my courage gone.\n\nSECOND SONNET\n\n  Last night I fain would sleep to dream of thee,\n  But jealous sleep fled my eyelids,\n  I sought the balcony and looked towards heaven,\n  Always my glance flies upward when I think of thee.\n\n  Strange sight! whose meaning love alone can tell,\n  The sky had lost its sapphire hue,\n  The stars, dulled diamonds in their golden mount,\n  Twinkled no more nor shed their warmth.\n\n  The moon, washed of her silver radiance lily-white,\n  Hung mourning over the gloomy plain, for thou hast robbed\n  The heavens of all that made them bright.\n\n  The snowy sparkle of the moon is on thy lovely brow,\n  Heaven's azure centres in thine eyes,\n  Thy lashes fall like starry rays.\n\nWhat more gracious way of saying to a young girl that she fills your\nlife? Tell me what you think of this love, which expends itself in\nlavishing the treasures alike of the earth and of the soul. Only within\nthe last ten days have I grasped the meaning of that Spanish gallantry,\nso famous in old days.\n\nAh me! dear, what is going on now at La Crampade? How often do I take\na stroll there, inspecting the growth of our crops! Have you no news\nto give of our mulberry trees, our last winter's plantations? Does\neverything prosper as you wish? And while the buds are opening on our\nshrubs--I will not venture to speak of the bedding-out plants--have they\nalso blossomed in the bosom of the wife? Does Louis continue his policy\nof madrigals? Do you enter into each other's thoughts? I wonder whether\nyour little runlet of wedding peace is better than the raging torrent of\nmy love! Has my sweet lady professor taken offence? I cannot believe\nit; and if it were so, I should send Felipe off at once, post-haste, to\nfling himself at her knees and bring back to me my pardon or her head.\nSweet love, my life here is a splendid success, and I want to know how\nit fares with life in Provence. We have just increased our family by the\naddition of a Spaniard with the complexion of a Havana cigar, and your\ncongratulations still tarry.\n\nSeriously, my sweet Renee, I am anxious. I am afraid lest you should be\neating your heart out in silence, for fear of casting a gloom over my\nsunshine. Write to me at once, naughty child! and tell me your life in\nits every minutest detail; tell me whether you still hold back, whether\nyour \"independence\" still stands erect, or has fallen on its knees,\nor is sitting down comfortably, which would indeed be serious. Can you\nsuppose that the incidents of your married life are without interest for\nme? I muse at times over all that you have said to me. Often when, at\nthe Opera, I seem absorbed in watching the pirouetting dancers, I am\nsaying to myself, \"It is half-past nine, perhaps she is in bed. What is\nshe about? Is she happy? Is she alone with her independence? or has her\nindependence gone the way of other dead and castoff independences?\"\n\nA thousand loves.\n\n\n\n\nXXV. RENEE DE L'ESTORADE TO LOUISE DE CHAULIEU\n\nSaucy girl! Why should I write? What could I say? Whilst your life is\nvaried by social festivities, as well as by the anguish, the tempers,\nand the flowers of love--all of which you describe so graphically, that\nI might be watching some first-rate acting at the theatre--mine is as\nmonotonous and regular as though it were passed in a convent.\n\nWe always go to bed at nine and get up with daybreak. Our meals are\nserved with a maddening punctuality. Nothing ever happens. I have\naccustomed myself without much difficulty to this mapping out of the\nday, which perhaps is, after all, in the nature of things. Where would\nthe life of the universe be but for that subjection to fixed laws which,\naccording to the astronomers, so Louis tells me, rule the spheres! It is\nnot order of which we weary.\n\nThen I have laid upon myself certain rules of dress, and these occupy\nmy time in the mornings. I hold it part of my duty as a wife to look as\ncharming as possible. I feel a certain satisfaction in it, and it causes\nlively pleasure to the good old man and to Louis. After lunch, we walk.\nWhen the newspapers arrive, I disappear to look after my household\naffairs or to read--for I read a great deal--or to write to you. I\ncome back to the others an hour before dinner; and after dinner we\nplay cards, or receive visits, or pay them. Thus my days pass between a\ncontented old man, who has done with passions, and the man who owes\nhis happiness to me. Louis' happiness is so radiant that it has at last\nwarmed my heart.\n\nFor women, happiness no doubt cannot consist in the mere satisfaction of\ndesire. Sometimes, in the evening, when I am not required to take a hand\nin the game, and can sink back in my armchair, imagination bears me on\nits strong wings into the very heart of your life. Then, its riches, its\nchangeful tints, its surging passions become my own, and I ask myself to\nwhat end such a stormy preface can lead. May I not swallow up the book\nitself? For you, my darling, the illusions of love are possible; for\nme, only the facts of homely life remain. Yes, your love seems to me a\ndream!\n\nTherefore I find it hard to understand why you are determined to throw\nso much romance over it. Your ideal man must have more soul than fire,\nmore nobility and self-command than passion. You persist in trying to\nclothe in living form the dream ideal of a girl on the threshold of\nlife; you demand sacrifices for the pleasure of rewarding them; you\nsubmit your Felipe to tests in order to ascertain whether desire, hope,\nand curiosity are enduring in their nature. But, child, behind all your\nfantastic stage scenery rises the altar, where everlasting bonds are\nforged. The very morrow of your marriage the graceful structure raised\nby your subtle strategy may fall before that terrible reality which\nmakes of a girl a woman, of a gallant a husband. Remember that there is\nnot exemption for lovers. For them, as for ordinary folk like Louis and\nme, there lurks beneath the wedding rejoicings the great \"Perhaps\" of\nRabelais.\n\nI do not blame you, though, of course, it was rash, for talking with\nFelipe in the garden, or for spending a night with him, you on your\nbalcony, he on his wall; but you make a plaything of life, and I am\nafraid that life may some day turn the tables. I dare not give you the\ncounsel which my own experience would suggest; but let me repeat once\nmore from the seclusion of my valley that the viaticum of married life\nlies in these words--resignation and self-sacrifice. For, spite of all\nyour tests, your coyness, and your vigilance, I can see that marriage\nwill mean to you what it has been to me. The greater the passion,\nthe steeper the precipice we have hewn for our fall--that is the only\ndifference.\n\nOh! what I would give to see the Baron de Macumer and talk with him for\nan hour or two! Your happiness lies so near my heart.\n\n\n\n\nXXVI. LOUISE DE MACUMER TO RENEE DE L'ESTORADE March.\n\nAs Felipe has carried out, with a truly Saracenic generosity, the wishes\nof my father and mother in acknowledging the fortune he has not received\nfrom me, the Duchess has become even more friendly to me than before.\nShe calls me little sly-boots, little woman of the world, and says I\nknow how to use my tongue.\n\n\"But, dear mamma,\" I said to her the evening before the contract was\nsigned, \"you attribute to cunning and smartness on my part what is\nreally the outcome of the truest, simplest, most unselfish, most devoted\nlove that ever was! I assure you that I am not at all the 'woman of the\nworld' you do me the honor of believing me to be.\"\n\n\"Come, come, Armande,\" she said, putting her arm on my neck and drawing\nme to her, in order to kiss my forehead, \"you did not want to go back\nto the convent, you did not want to die an old maid, and, like a fine,\nnoble-hearted Chaulieu, as you are, you recognized the necessity of\nbuilding up your father's family. (The Duke was listening. If you knew,\nRenee, what flattery lies for him in these words.) I have watched you\nduring the whole winter, poking your little nose into all that goes\non, forming very sensible opinions about men and the present state of\nsociety in France. And you have picked out the one Spaniard capable of\ngiving you the splendid position of a woman who reigns supreme in her\nown house. My little girl, you treated him exactly as Tullia treats your\nbrother.\"\n\n\"What lessons they give in my sister's convent!\" exclaimed my father.\n\nA glance at my father cut him short at once; then, turning to the\nDuchess, I said:\n\n\"Madame, I love my future husband, Felipe de Soria, with all the\nstrength of my soul. Although this love sprang up without my knowledge,\nand though I fought it stoutly when it first made itself felt, I swear\nto you that I never gave way to it till I had recognized in the Baron de\nMacumer a character worthy of mine, a heart of which the delicacy, the\ngenerosity, the devotion, and the temper are suited to my own.\"\n\n\"But, my dear,\" she began, interrupting me, \"he is as ugly as...\"\n\n\"As anything you like,\" I retorted quickly, \"but I love his ugliness.\"\n\n\"If you love him, Armande,\" said my father, \"and have the strength to\nmaster your love, you must not risk your happiness. Now, happiness in\nmarriage depends largely on the first days--\"\n\n\"Days only?\" interrupted my mother. Then, with a glance at my father,\nshe continued, \"You had better leave us, my dear, to have our talk\ntogether.\"\n\n\"You are to be married, dear child,\" the Duchess then began in a low\nvoice, \"in three days. It becomes my duty, therefore, without silly\nwhimpering, which would be unfitting our rank in life, to give you the\nserious advice which every mother owes to her daughter. You are marrying\na man whom you love, and there is no reason why I should pity you or\nmyself. I have only known you for a year; and if this period has been\nlong enough for me to learn to love you, it is hardly sufficient to\njustify floods of tears at the idea of losing you. Your mental gifts\nare even more remarkable than those of your person; you have gratified\nmaternal pride, and have shown yourself a sweet and loving daughter. I,\nin my turn, can promise you that you will always find a staunch friend\nin your mother. You smile? Alas! it too often happens that a mother who\nhas lived on excellent terms with her daughter, as long as the daughter\nis a mere girl, comes to cross purposes with her when they are both\nwomen together.\n\n\"It is your happiness which I want, so listen to my words. The love\nwhich you now feel is that of a young girl, and is natural to us all,\nfor it is woman's destiny to cling to a man. Unhappily, pretty one,\nthere is but one man in the world for a woman! And sometimes this man,\nwhom fate has marked out for us, is not the one whom we, mistaking a\npassing fancy for love, choose as husband. Strange as what I say may\nappear to you, it is worth noting. If we cannot love the man we have\nchosen, the fault is not exclusively ours, it lies with both, or\nsometimes with circumstances over which we have no control. Yet there is\nno reason why the man chosen for us by our family, the man to whom our\nfancy has gone out, should not be the man whom we can love. The barriers\nwhich arise later between husband and wife are often due to lack of\nperseverance on both sides. The task of transforming a husband into a\nlover is not less delicate than that other task of making a husband\nof the lover, in which you have just proved yourself marvelously\nsuccessful.\n\n\"I repeat it, your happiness is my object. Never allow yourself, then,\nto forget that the first three months of your married life may work\nyour misery if you do not submit to the yoke with the same forbearance,\ntenderness, and intelligence that you have shown during the days of\ncourtship. For, my little rogue, you know very well that you have\nindulged in all the innocent pleasures of a clandestine love affair. If\nthe culmination of your love begins with disappointment, dislike, nay,\neven with pain, well, come and tell me about it. Don't hope for too much\nfrom marriage at first; it will perhaps give you more discomfort than\njoy. The happiness of your life requires at least as patient cherishing\nas the early shoots of love.\n\n\"To conclude, if by chance you should lose the lover, you will find in\nhis place the father of your children. In this, my dear child, lies the\nwhole secret of social life. Sacrifice everything to the man whose name\nyou bear, the man whose honor and reputation cannot suffer in the least\ndegree without involving you in frightful consequences. Such sacrifice\nis thus not only an absolute duty for women of our rank, it is also\ntheir wisest policy. This, indeed, is the distinctive mark of great\nmoral principles, that they hold good and are expedient from whatever\naspect they are viewed. But I need say no more to you on this point.\n\n\"I fancy you are of a jealous disposition, and, my dear, if you knew\nhow jealous I am! But you must not be stupid over it. To publish your\njealousy to the world is like playing at politics with your cards upon\nthe table, and those who let their own game be seen learn nothing\nof their opponents'. Whatever happens, we must know how to suffer in\nsilence.\"\n\nShe added that she intended having some plain talk about me with Macumer\nthe evening before the wedding.\n\nRaising my mother's beautiful arm, I kissed her hand and dropped on it\na tear, which the tone of real feeling in her voice had brought to my\neyes. In the advice she had given me, I read high principle worthy of\nherself and of me, true wisdom, and a tenderness of heart unspoilt by\nthe narrow code of society. Above all, I saw that she understood my\ncharacter. These few simple words summed up the lessons which life and\nexperience had brought her, perhaps at a heavy price. She was moved, and\nsaid, as she looked at me:\n\n\"Dear little girl, you've got a nasty crossing before you. And most\nwomen, in their ignorance or their disenchantment, are as wise as the\nEarl of Westmoreland!\"\n\nWe both laughed; but I must explain the joke. The evening before, a\nRussian princess had told us an anecdote of this gentleman. He had\nsuffered frightfully from sea-sickness in crossing the Channel, and\nturned tail when he got near Italy, because he had heard some one speak\nof \"crossing\" the Alps. \"Thank you; I've had quite enough crossings\nalready,\" he said.\n\nYou will understand, Renee, that your gloomy philosophy and my mother's\nlecture were calculated to revive the fears which used to disturb us at\nBlois. The nearer marriage approached, the more did I need to summon\nall my strength, my resolution, and my affection to face this terrible\npassage from maidenhood to womanhood. All our conversations came back to\nmy mind, I re-read your letters and discerned in them a vague undertone\nof sadness.\n\nThis anxiety had one advantage at least; it helped me to the regulation\nexpression for a bride as commonly depicted. The consequence was that\non the day of signing the contract everybody said I looked charming and\nquite the right thing. This morning, at the Mairie, it was an informal\nbusiness, and only the witnesses were present.\n\nI am writing this tail to my letter while they are putting out my\ndress for dinner. We shall be married at midnight at the Church of\nSainte-Valere, after a very gay evening. I confess that my fears give me\na martyr-like and modest air to which I have no right, but which will be\nadmired--why, I cannot conceive. I am delighted to see that poor Felipe\nis every whit as timorous as I am; society grates on him, he is like a\nbat in a glass shop.\n\n\"Thank Heaven, the day won't last for ever!\" he whispered to me in all\ninnocence.\n\nIn his bashfulness and timidity he would have liked to have no one\nthere.\n\nThe Sardinian ambassador, when he came to sign the contract, took me\naside in order to present me with a pearl necklace, linked together\nby six splendid diamonds--a gift from my sister-in-law, the Duchess de\nSoria. Along with the necklace was a sapphire bracelet, on the under\nside of which were engraved the words, \"_Though unknown, beloved_.\" Two\ncharming letters came with these presents, which, however, I could not\naccept without consulting Felipe.\n\n\"For,\" I said, \"I should not like to see you wearing ornaments that came\nfrom any one but me.\"\n\nHe kissed my hand, quite moved, and replied:\n\n\"Wear them for the sake of the inscription, and also for the kind\nfeeling, which is sincere.\"\n\nSaturday evening.\n\nHere, then, my poor Renee, are the last words of your girl friend. After\nthe midnight Mass, we set off for an estate which Felipe, with kind\nthought for me, has bought in Nivernais, on the way to Provence. Already\nmy name is Louise de Macumer, but I leave Paris in a few hours as Louise\nde Chaulieu. However I am called, there will never be for you but one\nLouise.\n\n\n\n\nXXVII. THE SAME TO THE SAME October.\n\nI have not written to you, dear, since our marriage, nearly eight months\nago. And not a line from you! Madame, you are inexcusable.\n\nTo begin with, we set off in a post-chaise for the Castle of\nChantepleurs, the property which Macumer has bought in Nivernais.\nIt stands on the banks of the Loire, sixty leagues from Paris. Our\nservants, with the exception of my maid, were there before us, and we\narrived, after a very rapid journey, the next evening. I slept all the\nway from Paris to beyond Montargis. My lord and master put his arm\nround me and pillowed my head on his shoulder, upon an arrangement of\nhandkerchiefs. This was the one liberty he took; and the almost motherly\ntenderness which got the better of his drowsiness, touched me strangely.\nI fell asleep then under the fire of his eyes, and awoke to find them\nstill blazing; the passionate gaze remained unchanged, but what thoughts\nhad come and gone meanwhile! Twice he had kissed me on the forehead.\n\nAt Briare we had breakfast in the carriage. Then followed a talk like\nour old talks at Blois, while the same Loire we used to admire called\nforth our praises, and at half-past seven we entered the noble long\navenue of lime-trees, acacias, sycamores, and larches which leads\nto Chantepleurs. At eight we dined; at ten we were in our bedroom, a\ncharming Gothic room, made comfortable with every modern luxury. Felipe,\nwho is thought so ugly, seemed to me quite beautiful in his graceful\nkindness and the exquisite delicacy of his affection. Of passion, not\na trace. All through the journey he might have been an old friend of\nfifteen years' standing. Later, he has described to me, with all the\nvivid touches of his first letter, the furious storms that raged within\nand were not allowed to ruffle the outer surface.\n\n\"So far, I have found nothing very terrible in marriage,\" I said, as I\nwalked to the window and looked out on the glorious moon which lit up a\ncharming park, breathing of heavy scents.\n\nHe drew near, put his arm again round me, and said:\n\n\"Why fear it? Have I ever yet proved false to my promise in gesture or\nlook? Why should I be false in the future?\"\n\nYet never were words or glances more full of mastery; his voice thrilled\nevery fibre of my heart and roused a sleeping force; his eyes were like\nthe sun in power.\n\n\"Oh!\" I exclaimed, \"what a world of Moorish perfidy in this attitude of\nperpetual prostration!\"\n\nHe understood, my dear.\n\nSo, my fair sweetheart, if I have let months slip by without writing,\nyou can now divine the cause. I have to recall the girl's strange past\nin order to explain the woman to myself. Renee, I understand you now.\nNot to her dearest friend, not to her mother, not, perhaps, even to\nherself, can a happy bride speak of her happiness. This memory ought to\nremain absolutely her own, an added rapture--a thing beyond words, too\nsacred for disclosure!\n\nIs it possible that the name of duty has been given to the delicious\nfrenzy of the heart, to the overwhelming rush of passion? And for what\npurpose? What malevolent power conceived the idea of crushing a woman's\nsensitive delicacy and all the thousand wiles of her modesty under\nthe fetters of constraint? What sense of duty can force from her these\nflowers of the heart, the roses of life, the passionate poetry of her\nnature, apart from love? To claim feeling as a right! Why, it blooms of\nitself under the sun of love, and shrivels to death under the cold blast\nof distaste and aversion! Let love guard his own rights!\n\nOh! my noble Renee! I understand you now. I bow to your greatness,\namazed at the depth and clearness of your insight. Yes, the woman who\nhas not used the marriage ceremony, as I have done, merely to legalize\nand publish the secret election of her heart, has nothing left but to\nfly to motherhood. When earth fails, the soul makes for heaven!\n\nOne hard truth emerges from all that you have said. Only men who are\nreally great know how to love, and now I understand the reason of this.\nMan obeys two forces--one sensual, one spiritual. Weak or inferior men\nmistake the first for the last, whilst great souls know how to clothe\nthe merely natural instinct in all the graces of the spirit. The very\nstrength of this spiritual passion imposes severe self-restraint and\ninspires them with reverence for women. Clearly, feeling is sensitive\nin proportion to the calibre of the mental powers generally, and this\nis why the man of genius alone has something of a woman's delicacy.\nHe understands and divines woman, and the wings of passion on which he\nraises her are restrained by the timidity of the sensitive spirit. But\nwhen the mind, the heart, and the senses all have their share in the\nrapture which transports us--ah! then there is no falling to earth,\nrather it is to heaven we soar, alas! for only too brief a visit.\n\nSuch, dear soul, is the philosophy of the first three months of my\nmarried life. Felipe is angelic. Without figure of speech, he is another\nself, and I can think aloud with him. His greatness of soul passes my\ncomprehension. Possession only attaches him more closely to me, and he\ndiscovers in his happiness new motives for loving me. For him, I am the\nnobler part of himself. I can foresee that years of wedded life, far\nfrom impairing his affection, will only make it more assured, develop\nfresh possibilities of enjoyment, and bind us in more perfect sympathy.\nWhat a delirium of joy!\n\nIt is part of my nature that pleasure has an exhilarating effect on me;\nit leaves sunshine behind, and becomes a part of my inner being. The\ninterval which parts one ecstasy from another is like the short night\nwhich marks off our long summer days. The sun which flushed the mountain\ntops with warmth in setting finds them hardly cold when it rises. What\nhappy chance has given me such a destiny? My mother had roused a host of\nfears in me; her forecast, which, though free from the alloy of vulgar\npettiness, seemed to me redolent of jealousy, has been falsified by the\nevent. Your fears and hers, my own--all have vanished in thin air!\n\nWe remained at Chantepleurs seven months and a half, for all the world\nlike a couple of runaway lovers fleeing the parental warmth, while the\nroses of pleasure crowned our love and embellished our dual solitude.\nOne morning, when I was even happier than usual, I began to muse over my\nlot, and suddenly Renee and her prosaic marriage flashed into my mind.\nIt seemed to me that now I could grasp the inner meaning in your life.\nOh! my sweet, why do we speak a different tongue? Your marriage of\nconvenience and my love match are two worlds, as widely separated as\nthe finite from infinity. You still walk the earth, whilst I range the\nheavens! Your sphere is human, mine divine! Love crowned me queen, you\nreign by reason and duty. So lofty are the regions where I soar, that a\nfall would shiver me to atoms.\n\nBut no more of this. I shrink from painting to you the rainbow\nbrightness, the profusion, the exuberant joy of love's springtime, as we\nknow it.\n\nFor ten days we have been in Paris, staying in a charming house in the\nRue du Bac, prepared for us by the architect to whom Felipe intrusted\nthe decoration of Chantepleurs. I have been listening, in all the full\ncontent of an assured and sanctioned love, to that divine music of\nRossini's, which used to soothe me when, as a restless girl, I hungered\nvaguely after experience. They say I am more beautiful, and I have a\nchildish pleasure in hearing myself called \"Madame.\"\n\nFriday morning.\n\nRenee, my fair saint, the happiness of my own life pulls me for ever\nback to you. I feel that I can be more to you than ever before, you are\nso dear to me! I have studied your wedded life closely in the light of\nmy own opening chapters; and you seem to me to come out of the scrutiny\nso great, so noble, so splendid in your goodness, that I here declare\nmyself your inferior and humble admirer, as well as your friend. When\nI think what marriage has been to me, it seems to me that I should have\ndied, had it turned out otherwise. And you live! Tell me what your heart\nfeeds on! Never again shall I make fun of you. Mockery, my sweet, is the\nchild of ignorance; we jest at what we know nothing of. \"Recruits will\nlaugh where the veteran soldier looks grave,\" was a remark made to me\nby the Comte de Chaulieu, that poor cavalry officer whose campaigning so\nfar has consisted in marches from Paris to Fontainebleau and back again.\n\nI surmise, too, my dear love, that you have not told me all. There\nare wounds which you have hidden. You suffer; I am convinced of it. In\ntrying to make out at this distance and from the scraps you tell me the\nreasons of your conduct, I have weaved together all sorts of romantic\ntheories about you. \"She has made a mere experiment in marriage,\" I\nthought one evening, \"and what is happiness for me had proved only\nsuffering to her. Her sacrifice is barren of reward, and she would not\nmake it greater than need be. The unctuous axioms of social morality are\nonly used to cloak her disappointment.\" Ah! Renee, the best of happiness\nis that it needs no dogma and no fine words to pave the way; it speaks\nfor itself, while theory has been piled upon theory to justify the\nsystem of women's vassalage and thralldom. If self-denial be so noble,\nso sublime, what, pray, of my joy, sheltered by the gold-and-white\ncanopy of the church, and witnessed by the hand and seal of the most\nsour-faced of mayors? Is it a thing out of nature?\n\nFor the honor of the law, for her own sake, but most of all to make my\nhappiness complete, I long to see my Renee content. Oh! tell me that\nyou see a dawn of love for this Louis who adores you! Tell me that the\nsolemn, symbolic torch of Hymen has not alone served to lighten your\ndarkness, but that love, the glorious sun of our hearts, pours his rays\non you. I come back always, you see, to this midday blaze, which will be\nmy destruction, I fear.\n\nDear Renee, do you remember how, in your outbursts of girlish devotion,\nyou would say to me, as we sat under the vine-covered arbor of the\nconvent garden, \"I love you so, Louise, that if God appeared to me in a\nvision, I would pray Him that all the sorrows of life might be mine, and\nall the joy yours. I burn to suffer for you\"? Now, darling, the day has\ncome when I take up your prayer, imploring Heaven to grant you a share\nin my happiness.\n\nI must tell you my idea. I have a shrewd notion that you are hatching\nambitious plans under the name of Louis de l'Estorade. Very good; get\nhim elected deputy at the approaching election, for he will be very\nnearly forty then; and as the Chamber does not meet till six months\nlater, he will have just attained the age necessary to qualify for a\nseat. You will come to Paris--there, isn't that enough? My father,\nand the friends I shall have made by that time, will learn to know and\nadmire you; and if your father-in-law will agree to found a family, we\nwill get the title of Comte for Louis. That is something at least! And\nwe shall be together.\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII. RENEE DE L'ESTORADE TO LOUISE DE MACUMER December.\n\nMy thrice happy Louise, your letter made me dizzy. For a few moments I\nheld it in my listless hands, while a tear or two sparkled on it in the\nsetting sun. I was alone beneath the small barren rock where I have had\na seat placed; far off, like a lance of steel, the Mediterranean shone.\nThe seat is shaded by aromatic shrubs, and I have had a very large\njessamine, some honeysuckle, and Spanish brooms transplanted there, so\nthat some day the rock will be entirely covered with climbing plants.\nThe wild vine has already taken root there. But winter draws near, and\nall this greenery is faded like a piece of old tapestry. In this spot I\nam never molested; it is understood that here I wish to be alone. It is\nnamed Louise's seat--a proof, is it not, that even in solitude I am not\nalone here?\n\nIf I tell you all these details, to you so paltry, and try to describe\nthe vision of green with which my prophetic gaze clothes this bare\nrock--on which top some freak of nature has set up a magnificent parasol\npine--it is because in all this I have found an emblem to which I cling.\n\nIt was while your blessed lot was filling me with joy and--must I\nconfess it?--with bitter envy too, that I felt the first movement of my\nchild within, and this mystery of physical life reacted upon the inner\nrecesses of my soul. This indefinable sensation, which partakes of\nthe nature at once of a warning, a delight, a pain, a promise, and a\nfulfilment; this joy, which is mine alone, unshared by mortal, this\nwonder of wonders, has whispered to me that one day this rock shall be a\ncarpet of flowers, resounding to the merry laughter of children, that\nI shall at last be blessed among women, and from me shall spring forth\nfountains of life. Now I know what I have lived for! Thus the first\ncertainty of bearing within me another life brought healing to my\nwounds. A joy that beggars description has crowned for me those long\ndays of sacrifice, in which Louis had already found his.\n\nSacrifice! I said to myself, how far does it excel passion! What\npleasure has roots so deep as one which is not personal but creative? Is\nnot the spirit of Sacrifice a power mightier than any of its results? Is\nit not that mysterious, tireless divinity, who hides beneath innumerable\nspheres in an unexplored centre, through which all worlds in turn must\npass? Sacrifice, solitary and secret, rich in pleasures only tasted\nin silence, which none can guess at, and no profane eye has ever\nseen; Sacrifice, jealous God and tyrant, God of strength and victory,\nexhaustless spring which, partaking of the very essence of all\nthat exists, can by no expenditure be drained below its own\nlevel;--Sacrifice, there is the keynote of my life.\n\nFor you, Louise, love is but the reflex of Felipe's passion; the life\nwhich I shed upon my little ones will come back to me in ever-growing\nfulness. The plenty of your golden harvest will pass; mine, though late,\nwill be but the more enduring, for each hour will see it renewed. Love\nmay be the fairest gem which Society has filched from Nature; but what\nis motherhood save Nature in her most gladsome mood? A smile has dried\nmy tears. Love makes my Louis happy, but marriage has made me a mother,\nand who shall say I am not happy also?\n\nWith slow steps, then, I returned to my white grange, with the green\nshutters, to write you these thoughts.\n\nSo it is, darling, that the most marvelous, and yet the simplest,\nprocess of nature has been going on in me for five months; and yet--in\nyour ear let me whisper it--so far it agitates neither my heart nor\nmy understanding. I see all around me happy; the grandfather-to-be has\nbecome a child again, trespassing on the grandchild's place; the father\nwears a grave and anxious look; they are all most attentive to me, all\ntalk of the joy of being a mother. Alas! I alone remain cold, and I dare\nnot tell you how dead I am to all emotion, though I affect a little in\norder not to damp the general satisfaction. But with you I may be frank;\nand I confess that, at my present stage, motherhood is a mere affair of\nthe imagination.\n\nLouis was to the full as much surprised as I. Does not this show how\nlittle, unless by his impatient wishes, the father counts for in this\nmatter? Chance, my dear, is the sovereign deity in child-bearing. My\ndoctor, while maintaining that this chance works in harmony with nature,\ndoes not deny that children who are the fruit of passionate love are\nbound to be richly endowed both physically and mentally, and that often\nthe happiness which shone like a radiant star over their birth seems to\nwatch over them through life. It may be then, Louise, that motherhood\nreserves joys for you which I shall never know. It may be that the\nfeeling of a mother for the child of a man whom she adores, as you adore\nFelipe, is different from that with which she regards the offspring of\nreason, duty, and desperation!\n\nThoughts such as these, which I bury in my inmost heart, add to the\npreoccupation only natural to a woman soon to be a mother. And yet, as\nthe family cannot exist without children, I long to speed the moment\nfrom which the joys of family, where alone I am to find my life, shall\ndate their beginning. At present I live a life all expectation and\nmystery, except for a sickening physical discomfort, which no doubt\nserves to prepare a woman for suffering of a different kind. I watch my\nsymptoms; and in spite of the attentions and thoughtful care with which\nLouis' anxiety surrounds me, I am conscious of a vague uneasiness,\nmingled with the nausea, the distaste for food, and abnormal longings\ncommon to my condition. If I am to speak candidly, I must confess,\nat the risk of disgusting you with the whole business, to an\nincomprehensible craving for rotten fruit. My husband goes to Marseilles\nto fetch the finest oranges the world produces--from Malta, Portugal,\nCorsica--and these I don't touch. Then I hurry there myself, sometimes\non foot, and in a little back street, running down to the harbor, close\nto the Town Hall, I find wretched, half-putrid oranges, two for a sou,\nwhich I devour eagerly. The bluish, greenish shades on the mouldy parts\nsparkle like diamonds in my eyes, they are flowers to me; I forget\nthe putrid odor, and find them delicious, with a piquant flavor, and\nstimulating as wine. My dear, they are the first love of my life! Your\npassion for Felipe is nothing to this! Sometimes I can slip out secretly\nand fly to Marseilles, full of passionate longings, which grow more\nintense as I draw near the street. I tremble lest the woman should be\nsold out of rotten oranges; I pounce on them and devour them as I stand.\nIt seems to me an ambrosial food, and yet I have seen Louis turn aside,\nunable to bear the smell. Then came to my mind the ghastly words of\nObermann in his gloomy elegy, which I wish I had never read, \"Roots\nslake their thirst in foulest streams.\" Since I took to this diet, the\nsickness has ceased, and I feel much stronger. This depravity of taste\nmust have a meaning, for it seems to be part of a natural process and to\nbe common to most women, sometimes going to most extravagant lengths.\n\nWhen my situation is more marked, I shall not go beyond the grounds,\nfor I should not like to be seen under these circumstances. I have\nthe greatest curiosity to know at what precise moment the sense of\nmotherhood begins. It cannot possibly be in the midst of frightful\nsuffering, the very thought of which makes me shudder.\n\nFarewell, favorite of fortune! Farewell, my friend, in whom I live\nagain, and through whom I am able to picture to myself this brave love,\nthis jealousy all on fire at a look, these whisperings in the ear,\nthese joys which create for women, as it were, a new atmosphere, a new\ndaylight, fresh life! Ah! pet, I too understand love. Don't weary of\ntelling me everything. Keep faithful to our bond. I promise, in my turn,\nto spare you nothing.\n\nNay--to conclude in all seriousness--I will not conceal from you that,\non reading your letter a second time, I was seized with a dread which\nI could not shake off. This superb love seems like a challenge to\nProvidence. Will not the sovereign master of this earth, Calamity, take\numbrage if no place be left for him at your feast? What mighty edifice\nof fortune has he not overthrown? Oh! Louise, forget not, in all this\nhappiness, your prayers to God. Do good, be kind and merciful; let your\nmoderation, if it may be, avert disaster. Religion has meant much more\nto me since I left the convent and since my marriage; but your Paris\nnews contains no mention of it. In your glorification of Felipe it seems\nto me you reverse the saying, and invoke God less than His saint.\n\nBut, after all, this panic is only excess of affection. You go to church\ntogether, I do not doubt, and do good in secret. The close of this\nletter will seem to you very primitive, I expect, but think of the too\neager friendship which prompts these fears--a friendship of the type\nof La Fontaine's, which takes alarms at dreams, at half-formed, misty\nideas. You deserve to be happy, since, through it all, you still think\nof me, no less than I think of you, in my monotonous life, which, though\nit lacks color, is yet not empty, and, if uneventful, is not unfruitful.\nGod bless you, then!\n\n\n\n\nXXIX. M. DE L'ESTORADE TO THE BARONNE DE MACUMER December 1825.\n\nMadame,--It is the desire of my wife that you should not learn first\nfrom the formal announcement of an event which has filled us with\njoy. Renee has just given birth to a fine boy, whose baptism we are\npostponing till your return to Chantepleurs. Renee and I both earnestly\nhope that you may then come as far as La Crampade, and will consent to\nact as godmother to our firstborn. In this hope, I have had him placed\non the register under the name of Armand-Louis de l'Estorade.\n\nOur dear Renee suffered much, but bore it with angelic patience. You,\nwho know her, will easily understand that the assurance of bringing\nhappiness to us all supported her through this trying apprenticeship to\nmotherhood.\n\nWithout indulging in the more or less ludicrous exaggerations to which\nthe novel sensation of being a father is apt to give rise, I may tell\nyou that little Armand is a beautiful infant, and you will have no\ndifficulty in believing it when I add that he has Renee's features and\neyes. So far, at least, this gives proof of intelligence.\n\nThe physician and accoucheur assure us that Renee is now quite out of\ndanger; and as she is proving an admirable nurse--Nature has endowed her\nso generously!--my father and I are able to give free rein to our joy.\nMadame, may I be allowed to express the hope that this joy, so vivid and\nintense, which has brought fresh life into our house, and has changed\nthe face of existence for my dear wife, may ere long be yours?\n\nRenee has had a suite of rooms prepared, and I only wish I could make\nthem worthy of our guests. But the cordial friendliness of the reception\nwhich awaits you may perhaps atone for any lack of splendor.\n\nI have heard from Renee, madame, of your kind thought in regard to us,\nand I take this opportunity of thanking you for it, the more gladly\nbecause nothing could now be more appropriate. The birth of a grandson\nhas reconciled my father to sacrifices which bear hardly on an old man.\nHe has just bought two estates, and La Crampade is now a property with\nan annual rental of thirty thousand francs. My father intends asking the\nKing's permission to form an entailed estate of it; and if you are good\nenough to get for him the title of which you spoke in your last letter,\nyou will have already done much for your godson.\n\nFor my part, I shall carry out your suggestions solely with the object\nof bringing you and Renee together during the sessions of the Chamber.\nI am working hard with the view of becoming what is called a specialist.\nBut nothing could give me greater encouragement in my labors than the\nthought that you will take an interest in my little Armand. Come, then,\nwe beg of you, and with your beauty and your grace, your playful fancy\nand your noble soul, enact the part of good fairy to my son and heir.\nYou will thus, madame, add undying gratitude to the respectful regard of\nYour very humble, obedient servant, LOUIS DE L'ESTORADE.\n\n\n\n\nXXX. LOUISE DE MACUMER TO RENEE DE L'ESTORADE January 1826.\n\nMacumer has just wakened me, darling, with your husband's letter. First\nand foremost--Yes. We shall be going to Chantepleurs about the end of\nApril. To me it will be a piling up of pleasure to travel, to see\nyou, and to be the godmother of your first child. I must, please, have\nMacumer for godfather. To take part in a ceremony of the Church with\nanother as my partner would be hateful to me. Ah! if you could see the\nlook he gave me as I said this, you would know what store this sweetest\nof lovers sets on his wife!\n\n\"I am the more bent on our visiting La Crampade together, Felipe,\" I\nwent on, \"because I might have a child there. I too, you know, would be\na mother!... And yet, can you fancy me torn in two between you and\nthe infant? To begin with, if I saw any creature--were it even my\nown son--taking my place in your heart, I couldn't answer for the\nconsequences. Medea may have been right after all. The Greeks had some\ngood notions!\"\n\nAnd he laughed.\n\nSo, my sweetheart, you have the fruit without the flowers; I the flowers\nwithout the fruit. The contrast in our lives still holds good. Between\nthe two of us we have surely enough philosophy to find the moral of it\nsome day. Bah! only ten months married! Too soon, you will admit, to\ngive up hope.\n\nWe are leading a gay, yet far from empty life, as is the way with happy\npeople. The days are never long enough for us. Society, seeing me in\nthe trappings of a married woman, pronounces the Baronne de Macumer\nmuch prettier than Louise de Chaulieu: a happy love is a most becoming\ncosmetic. When Felipe and I drive along the Champs-Elysees in the\nbright sunshine of a crisp January day, beneath the trees, frosted with\nclusters of white stars, and face all Paris on the spot where last year\nwe met with a gulf between us, the contrast calls up a thousand fancies.\nSuppose, after all, your last letter should be right in its forecast,\nand we are too presumptuous!\n\nIf I am ignorant of a mother's joys, you shall tell me about them; I\nwill learn by sympathy. But my imagination can picture nothing to equal\nthe rapture of love. You will laugh at my extravagance; but, I assure\nyou, that a dozen times in as many months the longing has seized me to\ndie at thirty, while life was still untarnished, amidst the roses of\nlove, in the embrace of passion. To bid farewell to the feast at its\nbrightest, before disappointment has come, having lived in this sunshine\nand celestial air, and well-nigh spent myself in love, not a leaf\ndropped from my crown, not an illusion perished in my heart, what a\ndream is there! Think what it would be to bear about a young heart in an\naged body, to see only cold, dumb faces around me, where even strangers\nused to smile; to be a worthy matron! Can Hell have a worse torture?\n\nOn this very subject, in fact, Felipe and I have had our first quarrel.\nI contended that he ought to have sufficient moral strength to kill me\nin my sleep when I have reached thirty, so that I might pass from one\ndream to another. The wretch declined. I threatened to leave him alone\nin the world, and, poor child, he turned white as a sheet. My dear,\nthis distinguished statesman is neither more nor less than a baby. It is\nincredible what youth and simplicity he contrived to hide away. Now that\nI allow myself to think aloud with him, as I do with you, and have no\nsecrets from him, we are always giving each other surprises.\n\nDear Renee, Felipe and Louise, the pair of lovers, want to send a\npresent to the young mother. We would like to get something that would\ngive you pleasure, and we don't share the popular taste for surprises;\nso tell me quite frankly, please, what you would like. It ought to be\nsomething which would recall us to you in a pleasant way, something\nwhich you will use every day, and which won't wear out with use. The\nmeal which with us is most cheerful and friendly is lunch, and therefore\nthe idea occurred to me of a special luncheon service, ornamented with\nfigures of babies. If you approve of this, let me know at once; for it\nwill have to be ordered immediately if we are to bring it. Paris artists\nare gentlemen of far too much importance to be hurried. This will be my\noffering to Lucina.\n\nFarewell, dear nursing mother. May all a mother's delights be yours! I\nawait with impatience your first letter, which will tell me all about\nit, I hope. Some of the details in your husband's letter went to my\nheart. Poor Renee, a mother has a heavy price to pay. I will tell my\ngodson how dearly he must love you. No end of love, my sweet one.\n\n\n\n\nXXXI. RENEE DE L'ESTORADE TO LOUISE DE MACUMER\n\nIt is nearly five months now since baby was born, and not once, dear\nheart, have I found a single moment for writing to you. When you are a\nmother yourself, you will be more ready to excuse me, than you are now;\nfor you have punished me a little bit in making your own letters so few\nand far between. Do write, my darling! Tell me of your pleasures; lay on\nthe blue as brightly as you please. It will not hurt me, for I am happy\nnow, happier than you can imagine.\n\nI went in state to the parish church to hear the Mass for recovery from\nchildbirth, as is the custom in the old families of Provence. I was\nsupported on either side by the two grandfathers--Louis' father and my\nown. Never had I knelt before God with such a flood of gratitude in my\nheart. I have so much to tell you of, so many feelings to describe, that\nI don't know where to begin; but from amidst these confused memories,\none rises distinctly, that of my prayer in the church.\n\nWhen I found myself transformed into a joyful mother, on the very spot\nwhere, as a girl, I had trembled for my future, it seemed to my fancy\nthat the Virgin on the altar bowed her head and pointed to the infant\nChrist, who smiled at me! My heart full of pure and heavenly love,\nI held out little Armand for the priest to bless and bathe, in\nanticipation of the regular baptism to come later. But you will see us\ntogether then, Armand and me.\n\nMy child--come see how readily the word comes, and indeed there is none\nsweeter to a mother's heart and mind or on her lips--well, then, dear\nchild, during the last two months I used to drag myself wearily and\nheavily about the gardens, not realizing yet how precious was the\nburden, spite of all the discomforts it brought! I was haunted by\nforebodings so gloomy and ghastly, that they got the better even of\ncuriosity; in vain did I picture the delights of motherhood. My heart\nmade no response even to the thought of the little one, who announced\nhimself by lively kicking. That is a sensation, dear, which may be\nwelcome when it is familiar; but as a novelty, it is more strange than\npleasing. I speak for myself at least; you know I would never affect\nanything I did not really feel, and I look on my child as a gift\nstraight from Heaven. For one who saw in it rather the image of the man\nshe loved, it might be different.\n\nBut enough of such sad thoughts, gone, I trust, for ever.\n\nWhen the crisis came, I summoned all my powers of resistance, and braced\nmyself so well for suffering, that I bore the horrible agony--so they\ntell me--quite marvelously. For about an hour I sank into a sort of\nstupor, of the nature of a dream. I seemed to myself then two beings--an\nouter covering racked and tortured by red-hot pincers, and a soul at\npeace. In this strange state the pain formed itself into a sort of halo\nhovering over me. A gigantic rose seemed to spring out of my head\nand grow ever larger and larger, till it enfolded me in its blood-red\npetals. The same color dyed the air around, and everything I saw was\nblood-red. At last the climax came, when soul and body seemed no longer\nable to hold together; the spasms of pain gripped me like death itself.\nI screamed aloud, and found fresh strength against this fresh torture.\nSuddenly this concert of hideous cries was overborne by a joyful\nsound--the shrill wail of the newborn infant. No words can describe that\nmoment. It was as though the universe took part in my cries, when all at\nonce the chorus of pain fell hushed before the child's feeble note.\n\nThey laid me back again in the large bed, and it felt like paradise to\nme, even in my extreme exhaustion. Three or four happy faces pointed\nthrough tears to the child. My dear, I exclaimed in terror:\n\n\"It's just like a little monkey! Are you really and truly certain it is\na child?\"\n\nI fell back on my side, miserably disappointed at my first experience of\nmotherly feeling.\n\n\"Don't worry, dear,\" said my mother, who had installed herself as\nnurse. \"Why, you've got the finest baby in the world. You mustn't excite\nyourself; but give your whole mind now to turning yourself as much as\npossible into an animal, a milch cow, pasturing in the meadow.\"\n\nI fell asleep then, fully resolved to let nature have her way.\n\nAh! my sweet, how heavenly it was to waken up from all the pain\nand haziness of the first days, when everything was still dim,\nuncomfortable, confused. A ray of light pierced the darkness; my heart\nand soul, my inner self--a self I had never known before--rent the\nenvelope of gloomy suffering, as a flower bursts its sheath at the first\nwarm kiss of the sun, at the moment when the little wretch fastened on\nmy breast and sucked. Not even the sensation of the child's first cry\nwas so exquisite as this. This is the dawn of motherhood, this is the\n_Fiat lux_!\n\nHere is happiness, joy ineffable, though it comes not without pangs. Oh!\nmy sweet jealous soul, how you will relish a delight which exists only\nfor ourselves, the child, and God! For this tiny creature all knowledge\nis summed up in its mother's breast. This is the one bright spot in its\nworld, towards which its puny strength goes forth. Its thoughts cluster\nround this spring of life, which it leaves only to sleep, and whither\nit returns on waking. Its lips have a sweetness beyond words, and their\npressure is at once a pain and a delight, a delight which by every\nexcess becomes pain, or a pain which culminates in delight. The\nsensation which rises from it, and which penetrates to the very core\nof my life, baffles all description. It seems a sort of centre whence a\nmyriad joy-bearing rays gladden the heart and soul. To bear a child is\nnothing; to nourish it is birth renewed every hour.\n\nOh! Louise, there is no caress of lover with half the power of those\nlittle pink hands, as they stray about, seeking whereby to lay hold on\nlife. And the infant glances, now turned upon the breast, now raised to\nmeet our own! What dreams come to us as we watch the clinging nursling!\nAll our powers, whether of mind or body, are at its service; for it we\nbreathe and think, in it our longings are more than satisfied! The\nsweet sensation of warmth at the heart, which the sound of his first cry\nbrought to me--like the first ray of sunshine on the earth--came again\nas I felt the milk flow into his mouth, again as his eyes met mine, and\nat this moment I have felt it once more as his first smile gave token of\na mind working within--for he has laughed, my dear! A laugh, a glance,\na bite, a cry--four miracles of gladness which go straight to the heart\nand strike chords that respond to no other touch. A child is tied to\nour heart-strings, as the spheres are linked to their creator; we cannot\nthink of God except as a mother's heart writ large.\n\nIt is only in the act of nursing that a woman realizes her motherhood\nin visible and tangible fashion; it is a joy of every moment. The\nmilk becomes flesh before our eyes; it blossoms into the tips of those\ndelicate flower-like fingers; it expands in tender, transparent nails;\nit spins the silky tresses; it kicks in the little feet. Oh! those baby\nfeet, how plainly they talk to us! In them the child finds its first\nlanguage.\n\nYes, Louise, nursing is a miracle of transformation going on before\none's bewildered eyes. Those cries, they go to your heart and not your\nears; those smiling eyes and lips, those plunging feet, they speak\nin words which could not be plainer if God traced them before you in\nletters of fire! What else is there in the world to care about? The\nfather? Why, you could kill him if he dreamed of waking the baby! Just\nas the child is the world to us, so do we stand alone in the world for\nthe child. The sweet consciousness of a common life is ample recompense\nfor all the trouble and suffering--for suffering there is. Heaven save\nyou, Louise, from ever knowing the maddening agony of a wound which\ngapes afresh with every pressure of rosy lips, and is so hard to\nheal--the heaviest tax perhaps imposed on beauty. For know, Louise, and\nbeware! it visits only a fair and delicate skin.\n\nMy little ape has in five months developed into the prettiest darling\nthat ever mother bathed in tears of joy, washed, brushed, combed, and\nmade smart; for God knows what unwearied care we lavish upon those\ntender blossoms! So my monkey has ceased to exist, and behold in his\nstead a _baby_, as my English nurse says, a regular pink-and-white baby.\nHe cries very little too now, for he is conscious of the love bestowed\non him; indeed, I hardly ever leave him, and I strive to wrap him round\nin the atmosphere of my love.\n\nDear, I have a feeling now for Louis which is not love, but which ought\nto be the crown of a woman's love where it exists. Nay, I am not sure\nwhether this tender fondness, this unselfish gratitude, is not superior\nto love. From all that you have told me of it, dear pet, I gather that\nlove has something terribly earthly about it, whilst a strain of holy\npiety purifies the affection a happy mother feels for the author of her\nfar-reaching and enduring joys. A mother's happiness is like a beacon,\nlighting up the future, but reflected also on the past in the guise of\nfond memories.\n\nThe old l'Estorade and his son have moreover redoubled their devotion to\nme; I am like a new person to them. Every time they see me and speak\nto me, it is with a fresh holiday joy, which touches me deeply. The\ngrandfather has, I verily believe, turned child again; he looks at me\nadmiringly, and the first time I came down to lunch he was moved to\ntears to see me eating and suckling the child. The moisture in these dry\nold eyes, generally expressive only of avarice, was a wonderful comfort\nto me. I felt that the good soul entered into my joy.\n\nAs for Louis, he would shout aloud to the trees and stones of the\nhighway that he has a son; and he spends whole hours watching your\nsleeping godson. He does not know, he says, when he will grow used to\nit. These extravagant expressions of delight show me how great must\nhave been their fears beforehand. Louis has confided in me that he had\nbelieved himself condemned to be childless. Poor fellow! he has all\nat once developed very much, and he works even harder than he did. The\nfather in him has quickened his ambition.\n\nFor myself, dear soul, I grow happier and happier every moment. Each\nhour creates a fresh tie between the mother and her infant. The very\nnature of my feelings proves to me that they are normal, permanent, and\nindestructible; whereas I shrewdly suspect love, for instance, of being\nintermittent. Certainly it is not the same at all moments, the flowers\nwhich it weaves into the web of life are not all of equal brightness;\nlove, in short, can and must decline. But a mother's love has no\nebb-tide to fear; rather it grows with the growth of the child's needs,\nand strengthens with its strength. Is it not at once a passion, a\nnatural craving, a feeling, a duty, a necessity, a joy? Yes, darling,\nhere is woman's true sphere. Here the passion for self-sacrifice can\nexpend itself, and no jealousy intrudes.\n\nHere, too, is perhaps the single point on which society and nature\nare at one. Society, in this matter, enforces the dictates of nature,\nstrengthening the maternal instinct by adding to it family spirit and\nthe desire of perpetuating a name, a race, an estate. How tenderly must\nnot a woman cherish the child who has been the first to open up to her\nthese joys, the first to call forth the energies of her nature and to\ninstruct her in the grand art of motherhood! The right of the eldest,\nwhich in the earliest times formed a part of the natural order and was\nlost in the origins of society, ought never, in my opinion, to have been\nquestioned. Ah! how much a mother learns from her child! The constant\nprotection of a helpless being forces us to so strict an alliance with\nvirtue, that a woman never shows to full advantage except as a mother.\nThen alone can her character expand in the fulfilment of all life's\nduties and the enjoyment of all its pleasures. A woman who is not a\nmother is maimed and incomplete. Hasten, then, my sweetest, to fulfil\nyour mission. Your present happiness will then be multiplied by the\nwealth of my delights.\n\n23rd.\n\nI had to tear myself from you because your godson was crying. I can\nhear his cry from the bottom of the garden. But I would not let this go\nwithout a word of farewell. I have just been reading over what I have\nsaid, and am horrified to see how vulgar are the feelings expressed!\nWhat I feel, every mother, alas! since the beginning must have felt, I\nsuppose, in the same way, and put into the same words. You will laugh\nat me, as we do at the naive father who dilates on the beauty and\ncleverness of his (of course) quite exceptional offspring. But the\nrefrain of my letter, darling, is this, and I repeat it: I am as happy\nnow as I used to be miserable. This grange--and is it not going to be an\nestate, a family property?--has become my land of promise. The desert is\npast and over. A thousand loves, darling pet. Write to me, for now I can\nread without a tear the tale of your happy love. Farewell.\n\n\n\n\nXXXII. MME. DE MACUMER TO MME. DE L'ESTORADE March 1826.\n\nDo you know, dear, that it is more than three months since I have\nwritten to you or heard from you? I am the more guilty of the two, for I\ndid not reply to your last, but you don't stand on punctilio surely?\n\nMacumer and I have taken your silence for consent as regards the\nbaby-wreathed luncheon service, and the little cherubs are starting this\nmorning for Marseilles. It took six months to carry out the design.\nAnd so when Felipe asked me to come and see the service before it was\npacked, I suddenly waked up to the fact that we had not interchanged a\nword since the letter of yours which gave me an insight into a mother's\nheart.\n\nMy sweet, it is this terrible Paris--there's my excuse. What, pray, is\nyours? Oh! what a whirlpool is society! Didn't I tell you once that\nin Paris one must be as the Parisians? Society there drives out all\nsentiment; it lays en embargo on your time; and unless you are\nvery careful, soon eats away your heart altogether. What an amazing\nmasterpiece is the character of Celimene in Moliere's _Le Misanthrope_!\nShe is the society woman, not only of Louis XIV.'s time, but of our own,\nand of all, time.\n\nWhere should I be but for my breastplate--the love I bear Felipe? This\nvery morning I told him, as the outcome of these reflections, that he\nwas my salvation. If my evenings are a continuous round of parties,\nballs, concerts, and theatres, at night my heart expands again, and\nis healed of the wounds received in the world by the delights of the\npassionate love which await my return.\n\nI dine at home only when we have friends, so-called, with us, and spend\nthe afternoon there only on my day, for I have a day now--Wednesday--for\nreceiving. I have entered the lists with Mmes. d'Espard and de\nMaufrigneuse, and with the old Duchesse de Lenoncourt, and my house has\nthe reputation of being a very lively one. I allowed myself to become\nthe fashion, because I saw how much pleasure my success gave Felipe. My\nmornings are his; from four in the afternoon till two in the morning I\nbelong to Paris. Macumer makes an admirable host, witty and dignified,\nperfect in courtesy, and with an air of real distinction. No woman could\nhelp loving such a husband even if she had chosen him without consulting\nher heart.\n\nMy father and mother have left for Madrid. Louis XVIII. being out of the\nway, the Duchess had no difficulty in obtaining from our good-natured\nCharles X. the appointment of her fascinating poet; so he is carried off\nin the capacity of attache.\n\nMy brother, the Duc de Rhetore, deigns to recognize me as a person of\nmark. As for my younger brother, The Comte de Chaulieu, this buckram\nwarrior owes me everlasting gratitude. Before my father left, he spent\nmy fortune in acquiring for the Count an estate of forty thousand francs\na year, entailed on the title, and his marriage with Mlle. de Mortsauf,\nan heiress from Touraine, is definitely arranged. The King, in order to\npreserve the name and titles of the de Lenoncourt and de Givry families\nfrom extinction, is to confer these, together with the armorial\nbearings, by patent on my brother. Certainly it would never have done\nto allow these two fine names and their splendid motto, _Faciem semper\nmonstramus_, to perish. Mlle. de Mortsauf, who is granddaughter and\nsole heiress of the Duc de Lenoncourt-Givry, will, it is said, inherit\naltogether more than one hundred thousand livres a year. The only\nstipulation my father has made is that the de Chaulieu arms should\nappear in the centre of the de Lenoncourt escutcheon. Thus my brother\nwill be Duc de Lenoncourt. The young de Mortsauf, to whom everything\nwould otherwise go, is in the last stage of consumption; his death is\nlooked for every day. The marriage will take place next winter when\nthe family are out of mourning. I am told that I shall have a charming\nsister-in-law in Mlle. de Mortsauf.\n\nSo you see that my father's reasoning is justified. The outcome of\nit all has won me many compliments, and my marriage is explained\nto everybody's satisfaction. To complete our success, the Prince de\nTalleyrand, out of affection for my grandmother, is showing himself a\nwarm friend to Macumer. Society, which began by criticising me, has now\npassed to cordial admiration.\n\nIn short, I now reign a queen where, barely two years ago, I was an\ninsignificant item. Macumer finds himself the object of universal envy,\nas the husband of \"the most charming woman in Paris.\" At least a score\nof women, as you know, are always in that proud position. Men murmur\nsweet things in my ear, or content themselves with greedy glances. This\nchorus of longing and admiration is so soothing to one's vanity, that I\nconfess I begin to understand the unconscionable price women are ready\nto pay for such frail and precarious privileges. A triumph of this kind\nis like strong wine to vanity, self-love, and all the self-regarding\nfeelings. To pose perpetually as a divinity is a draught so potent in\nits intoxicating effects, that I am no longer surprised to see women\ngrow selfish, callous, and frivolous in the heart of this adoration. The\nfumes of society mount to the head. You lavish the wealth of your soul\nand spirit, the treasures of your time, the noblest efforts of your\nwill, upon a crowd of people who repay you in smiles and jealousy. The\nfalse coin of their pretty speeches, compliments, and flattery is the\nonly return they give for the solid gold of your courage and sacrifices,\nand all the thought that must go to keep up without flagging the\nstandard of beauty, dress, sparkling talk, and general affability. You\nare perfectly aware how much it costs, and that the whole thing is a\nfraud, but you cannot keep out of the vortex.\n\nAh! my sweetheart, how one craves for a real friend! How precious to me\nare the love and devotion of Felipe, and how my heart goes out to you!\nJoyfully indeed are we preparing for our move to Chantepleurs, where\nwe can rest from the comedy of the Rue de Bac and of the Paris\ndrawing-rooms. Having just read your letter again, I feel that I cannot\nbetter describe this demoniac paradise than by saying that no woman of\nfashion in Paris can possibly be a good mother.\n\nGood-bye, then, for a short time, dear one. We shall stay at\nChantepleurs only a week at most, and shall be with you about May 10th.\nSo we are actually to meet again after more than two years! What changes\nsince then! Here we are, both matrons, both in our promised land--I of\nlove, you of motherhood.\n\nIf I have not written, my sweetest, it is not because I have forgotten\nyou. And what of the monkey godson? Is he still pretty and a credit to\nme? He must be more than nine months' old now. I should dearly like to\nbe present when he makes his first steps upon this earth; but Macumer\ntells me that even precocious infants hardly walk at ten months.\n\nWe shall have some good gossips there, and \"cut pinafores,\" as the Blois\nfolk say. I shall see whether a child, as the saying goes, spoils the\npattern.\n\nP. S.--If you deign to reply from your maternal heights, address to\nChantepleurs. I am just off.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII. MME. DE L'ESTORADE TO MME. DE MACUMER\n\nMy child,--If ever you become a mother, you will find out that it is\nimpossible to write letters during the first two months of your nursing.\nMary, my English nurse, and I are both quite knocked up. It is true I\nhad not told you that I was determined to do everything myself.\nBefore the event I had with my own fingers sewn the baby clothes and\nembroidered and edged with lace the little caps. I am a slave, my pet, a\nslave day and night.\n\nTo begin with, Master Armand-Louis takes his meals when it pleases\nhim, and that is always; then he has often to be changed, washed, and\ndressed. His mother is so fond of watching him sleep, of singing songs\nto him, of walking him about in her arms on a fine day, that she has\nlittle time left to attend to herself. In short, what society has been\nto you, my child--our child--has been to me!\n\nI cannot tell you how full and rich my life has become, and I long\nfor your coming that you may see for yourself. The only thing is, I\nam afraid he will soon be teething, and that you will find a peevish,\ncrying baby. So far he has not cried much, for I am always at hand.\nBabies only cry when their wants are not understood, and I am constantly\non the lookout for his. Oh! my sweet, my heart has opened up so wide,\nwhile you allow yours to shrink and shrivel at the bidding of society! I\nlook for your coming with all a hermit's longing. I want so much to know\nwhat you think of l'Estorade, just as you no doubt are curious for my\nopinion of Macumer.\n\nWrite to me from your last resting-place. The gentlemen want to go and\nmeet our distinguished guests. Come, Queen of Paris, come to our humble\ngrange, where love at least will greet you!\n\n\n\n\nXXXIV. MME. DE MACUMER TO THE VICOMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE April 1826.\n\nThe name on this address will tell you, dear, that my petition has been\ngranted. Your father-in-law is now Comte de l'Estorade. I would not\nleave Paris till I had obtained the gratification of your wishes, and I\nam writing in the presence of the Keeper of the Seals, who has come to\ntell me that the patent is signed.\n\nGood-bye for a short time!\n\n\n\n\nXXXV. THE SAME TO THE SAME MARSEILLES, July.\n\nI am ashamed to think how my sudden flight will have taken you by\nsurprise. But since I am above all honest, and since I love you not one\nbit the less, I shall tell you the truth in four words: I am horribly\njealous!\n\nFelipe's eyes were too often on you. You used to have little talks\ntogether at the foot of your rock, which were a torture to me; and I\nwas fast becoming irritable and unlike myself. Your truly Spanish beauty\ncould not fail to recall to him his native land, and along with it Marie\nHeredia, and I can be jealous of the past too. Your magnificent black\nhair, your lovely dark eyes, your brow, where the peaceful joy of\nmotherhood stands out radiant against the shadows which tell of past\nsuffering, the freshness of your southern skin, far fairer than that\nof a blonde like me, the splendid lines of your figure, the breasts,\non which my godson hangs, peeping through the lace like some luscious\nfruit,--all this stabbed me in the eyes and in the heart. In vain did\nI stick cornflowers in my curls, in vain set off with cherry-colored\nribbons the tameness of my pale locks, everything looked washed out when\nRenee appeared--a Renee so unlike the one I expected to find in your\noasis.\n\nThen Felipe made too much of the child, whom I found myself beginning to\nhate. Yes, I confess it, that exuberance of life which fills your house,\nmaking it gay with shouts and laughter--I wanted it for myself. I read a\nregret in Macumer's eyes, and, unknown to him, I cried over it two whole\nnights. I was miserable in your house. You are too beautiful as a woman,\ntoo triumphant as a mother, for me to endure your company.\n\nAh! you complained of your lot. Hypocrite! What would you have?\nL'Estorade is most presentable; he talks well; he has fine eyes; and his\nblack hair, dashed with white, is very becoming; his southern manners,\ntoo, have something attractive about them. As far as I can make out, he\nwill, sooner or later, be elected deputy for the Bouches-du-Rhone; in\nthe Chamber he is sure to come to the front, for you can always count on\nme to promote your interests. The sufferings of his exile have given him\nthat calm and dignified air which goes half-way, in my opinion, to\nmake a politician. For the whole art of politics, dear, seems to me to\nconsist in looking serious. At this rate, Macumer, as I told him, ought\ncertainly to have a high position in the state.\n\nAnd so, having completely satisfied myself of your happiness, I fly off\ncontented to my dear Chantepleurs, where Felipe must really achieve his\naspirations. I have made up my mind not to receive you there without a\nfine baby at my breast to match yours.\n\nOh! I know very well I deserve all the epithets you can hurl at me. I am\na fool, a wretch, an idiot. Alas! that is just what jealousy means. I\nam not vexed with you, but I was miserable, and you will forgive me\nfor escaping from my misery. Two days more, and I should have made\nan exhibition of myself; yes, there would have been an outbreak of\nvulgarity.\n\nBut in spite of the rage gnawing at my heart, I am glad to have come,\nglad to have seen you in the pride of your beautiful motherhood, my\nfriend still, as I remain yours in all the absorption of my love. Why,\neven here at Marseilles, only a step from your door, I begin to feel\nproud of you and of the splendid mother that you will make.\n\nHow well you judged your vocation! You seem to me born for the part of\nmother rather than of lover, exactly as the reverse is true of me. There\nare women capable of neither, hard-favored or silly women. A good mother\nand a passionately loving wife have this in common, that they both need\nintelligence and discretion ever at hand, and an unfailing command of\nevery womanly art and grace. Oh! I watched you well; need I add, sly\npuss, that I admired you too! Your children will be happy, but not\nspoilt, with your tenderness lapping them round and the clear light of\nyour reason playing softly on them.\n\nTell Louis the truth about my going away, but find some decent\nexcuse for your father-in-law, who seems to act as steward for the\nestablishment; and be careful to do the same for your family--a true\nProvencal version of the Harlowe family. Felipe does not know why I\nleft, and he will never know. If he asks, I shall contrive to find some\ncolorable pretext, probably that you were jealous of me! Forgive me this\nlittle conventional fib.\n\nGood-bye. I write in haste, as I want you to get this at lunch-time;\nand the postilion, who has undertaken to convey it to you, is here,\nrefreshing himself while he waits.\n\nMany kisses to my dear little godson. Be sure you come to Chantepleurs\nin October. I shall be alone there all the time that Macumer is away\nin Sardinia, where he is designing great improvements in his estate. At\nleast that is his plan for the moment, and his pet vanity consists in\nhaving a plan. Then he feels that he has a will of his own, and this\nmakes him very uneasy when he unfolds it to me. Good-bye!\n\n\n\n\nXXXVI. THE VICOMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE TO THE BARONNE DE MACUMER\n\nDear,--no words can express the astonishment of all our party when, at\nluncheon, we were told that you had both gone, and, above all, when the\npostilion who took you to Marseilles handed me your mad letter. Why,\nnaughty child, it was of your happiness, and nothing else, that made the\ntheme of those talks below the rock, on the \"Louise\" seat, and you had\nnot the faintest justification for objecting to them. _Ingrata!_ My\nsentence on you is that you return here at my first summons. In that\nhorrid letter, scribbled on the inn paper, you did not tell me\nwhat would be your next stopping place; so I must address this to\nChantepleurs.\n\nListen to me, dear sister of my heart. Know first, that my mind is set\non your happiness. Your husband, dear Louise, commands respect, not only\nby his natural gravity and dignified expression, but also because he\nsomehow impresses one with the splendid power revealed in his piquant\nplainness and in the fire of his velvet eyes; and you will understand\nthat it was some little time before I could meet him on those easy terms\nwhich are almost necessary for intimate conversation. Further, this man\nhas been Prime Minister, and he idolizes you; whence it follows that he\nmust be a profound dissembler. To fish up secrets, therefore, from the\nrocky caverns of this diplomatic soul is a work demanding a skilful hand\nno less than a ready brain. Nevertheless, I succeeded at last, without\nrousing my victim's suspicions, in discovering many things of which you,\nmy pet, have no conception.\n\nYou know that, between us two, my part is rather that of reason, yours\nof imagination: I personify sober duty, you reckless love. It has\npleased fate to continue in our lives this contrast in character\nwhich was imperceptible to all except ourselves. I am a simple country\nvicountess, very ambitious, and making it her task to lead her family on\nthe road to prosperity. On the other hand, Macumer, late Duc de Soria,\nhas a name in the world, and you, a duchess by right, reign in Paris,\nwhere reigning is no easy matter even for kings. You have a considerable\nfortune, which will be doubled if Macumer carries out his projects for\ndeveloping his great estates in Sardinia, the resources of which are\nmatter of common talk at Marseilles. Deny, if you can, that if either\nhas the right to be jealous, it is not you. But, thank God, we have\nboth hearts generous enough to place our friendship beyond reach of such\nvulgar pettiness.\n\nI know you, dear; I know that, ere now, you are ashamed of having fled.\nBut don't suppose that your flight will save you from a single word of\ndiscourse which I had prepared for your benefit to-day beneath the rock.\nRead carefully then, I beg of you, what I say, for it concerns you even\nmore closely than Macumer, though he also enters largely into my sermon.\n\nFirstly, my dear, you do not love him. Before two years are over, you\nwill be sick of adoration. You will never look on Felipe as a husband;\nto you he will always be the lover whom you can play with, for that\nis how all women treat their lovers. You do not look up to him, or\nreverence, or worship him as a woman should the god of her idolatry. You\nsee, I have made a study of love, my sweet, and more than once have I\ntaken soundings in the depth of my own heart. Now, as the result of a\ncareful diagnosis of your case, I can say with confidence, this is not\nlove.\n\nYes, dear Queen of Paris, you cannot escape the destiny of all queens.\nThe day will come when you long to be treated as a light-o'-love, to\nbe mastered and swept off your feet by a strong man, one who will not\nprostrate himself in adoration before you, but will seize your arm\nroughly in a fit of jealousy. Macumer loves you too fondly ever to be\nable either to resist you or find fault with you. A single glance from\nyou, a single coaxing word, would melt his sternest resolution. Sooner\nor later, you will learn to scorn this excessive devotion. He spoils\nyou, alas! just as I used to spoil you at the convent, for you are a\nmost bewitching woman, and there is no escaping your siren-like charms.\n\nWorse than all, you are candid, and it often happens that our happiness\ndepends on certain social hypocrisies to which you will never stoop. For\ninstance, society will not tolerate a frank display of the wife's power\nover her husband. The convention is that a man must no more show himself\nthe lover of his wife, however passionately he adores her, than a\nmarried woman may play the part of a mistress. This rule you both\ndisregard.\n\nIn the first place, my child, from what you have yourself told me, it\nis clear that the one unpardonable sin in society is to be happy. If\nhappiness exists, no one must know of it. But this is a small point.\nWhat seems to me important is that the perfect equality which reigns\nbetween lovers ought never to appear in the case of husband and wife,\nunder pain of undermining the whole fabric of society and entailing\nterrible disasters. If it is painful to see a man whom nature has made a\nnonentity, how much worse is the spectacle of a man of parts brought\nto that position? Before very long you will have reduced Macumer to the\nmere shadow of a man. He will cease to have a will and character of his\nown, and become mere clay in your hands. You will have so completely\nmoulded him to your likeness, that your household will consist of only\none person instead of two, and that one necessarily imperfect. You will\nregret it bitterly; but when at last you deign to open your eyes, the\nevil will be past cure. Do what we will, women do not, and never\nwill, possess the qualities which are characteristic of men, and these\nqualities are absolutely indispensable to family life. Already Macumer,\nblinded though he is, has a dim foreshadowing of this future; he feels\nhimself less a man through his love. His visit to Sardinia is a proof to\nme that he hopes by this temporary separation to succeed in recovering\nhis old self.\n\nYou never scruple to use the power which his love has placed in your\nhand. Your position of vantage may be read in a gesture, a look, a tone.\nOh! darling, how truly are you the mad wanton your mother called you!\nYou do not question, I fancy, that I am greatly Louis' superior. Well,\nI would ask you, have you ever heard me contradict him? Am I not always,\nin the presence of others, the wife who respects in him the authority of\nthe family? Hypocrisy! you will say. Well, listen to me. It is true that\nif I want to give him any advice which I think may be of use to him, I\nwait for the quiet and seclusion of our bedroom to explain what I\nthink and wish; but, I assure you, sweetheart, that even there I never\narrogate to myself the place of mentor. If I did not remain in private\nthe same submissive wife that I appear to others, he would lose\nconfidence in himself. Dear, the good we do to others is spoilt unless\nwe efface ourselves so completely that those we help have no sense of\ninferiority. There is a wonderful sweetness in these hidden sacrifices,\nand what a triumph for me in your unsuspecting praises of Louis! There\ncan be no doubt also that the happiness, the comfort, the hope of the\nlast two years have restored what misfortune, hardship, solitude, and\ndespondency has robbed him of.\n\nThis, then, is the sum-total of my observations. At the present moment\nyou love in Felipe, not your husband, but yourself. There is truth in\nyour father's words; concealed by the spring-flowers of your passion\nlies all the great lady's selfishness. Ah! my child, how I must love you\nto speak such bitter truths!\n\nLet me tell you, if you will promise never to breathe a word of this\nto the Baron, the end of our talk. We had been singing your praises\nin every key, for he soon discovered that I loved you like a\nfondly-cherished sister, and having insensibly brought him to a\nconfidential mood, I ventured to say:\n\n\"Louise has never yet had to struggle with life. She has been the spoilt\nchild of fortune, and she might yet have to pay for this were you not\nthere to act the part of father as well as lover.\"\n\n\"Ah! but is it possible?...\" He broke off abruptly, like a man who sees\nhimself on the edge of a precipice. But the exclamation was enough for\nme. No doubt, if you had stayed, he would have spoken more freely later.\n\nMy sweet, think of the day awaiting you when your husband's strength\nwill be exhausted, when pleasure will have turned to satiety, and he\nsees himself, I will not say degraded, but shorn of his proper dignity\nbefore you. The stings of conscience will then waken a sort of remorse\nin him, all the more painful for you, because you will feel yourself\nresponsible, and you will end by despising the man whom you have not\naccustomed yourself to respect. Remember, too, that scorn with a woman\nis only the earliest phase of hatred. You are too noble and generous, I\nknow, ever to forget the sacrifices which Felipe has made for you; but\nwhat further sacrifices will be left for him to make when he has, so to\nspeak, served up himself at the first banquet? Woe to the man, as to\nthe woman, who has left no desire unsatisfied! All is over then. To our\nshame or our glory--the point is too nice for me to decide--it is of\nlove alone that women are insatiable.\n\nOh! Louise, change yet, while there is still time. If you would only\nadopt the same course with Macumer that I have done with l'Estorade, you\nmight rouse the sleeping lion in your husband, who is made of the stuff\nof heroes. One might almost say that you grudge him his greatness.\nWould you feel no pride in using your power for other ends than your own\ngratification, in awakening the genius of a gifted man, as I in raising\nto a higher level one of merely common parts?\n\nHad you remained with us, I should still have written this letter, for\nin talking you might have cut me short or got the better of me with your\nsharp tongue. But I know that you will read this thoughtfully and weigh\nmy warnings. Dear heart, you have everything in life to make you happy,\ndo not spoil your chances; return to Paris, I entreat you, as soon\nas Macumer comes back. The engrossing claims of society, of which I\ncomplained, are necessary for both of you; otherwise you would spend\nyour life in mutual self-absorption. A married woman ought not to be too\nlavish of herself. The mother of a family, who never gives her household\nan opportunity of missing her, runs the risk of palling on them. If I\nhave several children, as I trust for my own sake I may, I assure you I\nshall make a point of reserving to myself certain hours which shall\nbe held sacred; even to one's children one's presence should not be a\nmatter of daily bread.\n\nFarewell, my dear jealous soul! Do you know that many women would be\nhighly flattered at having roused this passing pang in you? Alas! I can\nonly mourn, for what is not mother in me is your dear friend. A thousand\nloves. Make what excuse you will for leaving; if you are not sure of\nMacumer, I am of Louis.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVII. THE BARONNE DE MACUMER TO THE VICOMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE Genoa.\n\nMy beloved beauty,--I was bitten with the fancy to see something of\nItaly, and I am delighted at having carried off Macumer, whose plans in\nregard to Sardinia are postponed.\n\nThis country is simple ravishing. The churches--above all, the\nchapels--have a seductive, bewitching air, which must make every female\nProtestant yearn after Catholicism. Macumer has been received with\nacclamation, and they are all delighted to have made an Italian of so\ndistinguished a man. Felipe could have the Sardinian embassy at Paris if\nI cared about it, for I am made much of at court.\n\nIf you write, address your letters to Florence. I have not time now\nto go into any details, but I will tell you the story of our travels\nwhenever you come to Paris. We only remain here a week, and then go on\nto Florence, taking Leghorn on the way. We shall stay a month in Tuscany\nand a month at Naples, so as to reach Rome in November. Thence we return\nhome by Venice, where we shall spend the first fortnight of December,\nand arrive in Paris, _via_ Milan and Turin, for January.\n\nOur journey is a perfect honeymoon; the sight of new places gives fresh\nlife to our passion. Macumer did not know Italy at all, and we have\nbegun with that splendid Cornice road, which might be the work of fairy\narchitects.\n\nGood-bye, darling. Don't be angry if I don't write. It is impossible\nto get a minute to oneself in traveling; my whole time is taken up with\nseeing, admiring, and realizing my impressions. But not a word to you of\nthese till memory has given them their proper atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVIII. THE VICOMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE TO THE BARONNE DE MACUMER\nSeptember.\n\nMy dear,--There is lying for you at Chantepleurs a full reply to the\nletter you wrote me from Marseilles. This honeymoon journey, so far from\ndiminishing the fears I there expressed, makes me beg of you to get my\nletter sent on from Nivernais.\n\nThe Government, it is said, are resolved on dissolution. This is unlucky\nfor the Crown, since the last session of this loyal Parliament would\nhave been devoted to the passing of laws, essential to the consolidation\nof its power; and it is not less so for us, as Louis will not be forty\ntill the end of 1827. Fortunately, however, my father has agreed to\nstand, and he will resign his seat when the right moment arrives.\n\nYour godson has found out how to walk without his godmother's help. He\nis altogether delicious, and begins to make the prettiest little signs\nto me, which bring home to one that here is really a thinking being, not\na mere animal or sucking machine. His smiles are full of meaning. I have\nbeen so successful in my profession of nurse that I shall wean Armand in\nDecember. A year at the breast is quite enough; children who are suckled\nlonger are said to grow stupid, and I am all for popular sayings.\n\nYou must make a tremendous sensation in Italy, my fair one with the\ngolden locks. A thousand loves.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIX. THE BARONNE DE MACUMER TO THE VICOMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE\n\nYour atrocious letter has reached me here, the steward having forwarded\nit by my orders. Oh! Renee... but I will spare you the outburst of my\nwounded feelings, and simply tell you the effect your letter produced.\n\nWe had just returned from a delightful reception given in our honor\nby the ambassador, where I appeared in all my glory, and Macumer was\ncompletely carried away in a frenzy of love which I could not describe.\nThen I read him your horrible answer to my letter, and I read it\nsobbing, at the risk of making a fright of myself. My dear Arab fell at\nmy feet, declaring that you raved. Then he carried me off to the balcony\nof the palace where we are staying, from which we have a view over\npart of the city; there he spoke to me words worthy of the magnificent\nmoonlight scene which lay stretched before us. We both speak Italian\nnow, and his love, told in that voluptuous tongue, so admirably adapted\nto the expression of passion, sounded in my ears like the most exquisite\npoetry. He swore that, even were you right in your predictions, he\nwould not exchange for a lifetime a single one of our blessed nights\nor charming mornings. At this reckoning he has already lived a thousand\nyears. He is content to have me for his mistress, and would claim\nno other title than that of lover. So proud and pleased is he to see\nhimself every day the chosen of my heart, that were Heaven to offer\nhim the alternative between living as you would have us to for another\nthirty years with five children, and five years spent amid the dear\nroses of our love, he would not hesitate. He would take my love, such as\nit is, and death.\n\nWhile he was whispering this in my ear, his arm round me, my head\nresting on his shoulder, the cries of a bat, surprised by an owl,\ndisturbed us. This death-cry struck me with such terror that Felipe\ncarried me half-fainting to my bed. But don't be alarmed! Though\nthis augury of evil still resounds in my soul, I am quite myself this\nmorning. As soon as I was up, I went to Felipe, and, kneeling before\nhim, my eyes fixed on his, his hands clasped in mine, I said to him:--\n\n\"My love, I am a child, and Renee may be right after all. It may be only\nyour love that I love in you; but at least I can assure you that this\nis the one feeling of my heart, and that I love you as it is given me to\nlove. But if there be aught in me, in my lightest thought or deed, which\njars on your wishes or conception of me, I implore you to tell me, to\nsay what it is. It will be a joy to me to hear you and to take your eyes\nas the guiding-stars of my life. Renee has frightened me, for she is a\ntrue friend.\"\n\nMacumer could not find voice to reply, tears choked him.\n\nI can thank you now, Renee. But for your letter I should not have known\nthe depths of love in my noble, kingly Macumer. Rome is the city of\nlove; it is there that passion should celebrate its feast, with art and\nreligion as confederates.\n\nAt Venice we shall find the Duc and Duchesse de Soria. If you write,\naddress now to Paris, for we shall leave Rome in three days. The\nambassador's was a farewell party.\n\nP. S.--Dear, silly child, your letter only shows that you knew nothing\nof love, except theoretically. Learn then that love is a quickening\nforce which may produce fruits so diverse that no theory can embrace or\nco-ordinate them. A word this for my little Professor with her armor of\nstays.\n\n\n\n\nXL. THE COMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE TO THE BARONNE DE MACUMER January 1827.\n\nMy father has been elected to the Chamber, my father-in-law is dead, and\nI am on the point of my second confinement; these are the chief events\nmarking the end of the year for us. I mention them at once, lest the\nsight of the black seal should frighten you.\n\nMy dear, your letter from Rome made my flesh creep. You are nothing but\na pair of children. Felipe is either a dissembling diplomat or else his\nlove for you is the love a man might have for a courtesan, on whom he\nsquanders his all, knowing all the time that she is false to him. Enough\nof this. You say I rave, so I had better hold my tongue. Only this would\nI say, from the comparison of our two very different destinies I draw\nthis harsh moral--Love not if you would be loved.\n\nMy dear, when Louis was elected to the provincial Council, he received\nthe cross of the Legion of Honor. That is now nearly three years ago;\nand as my father--whom you will no doubt see in Paris during the course\nof the session--has asked the rank of Officer of the Legion for his\nson-in-law, I want to know if you will do me the kindness to take in\nhand the bigwig, whoever he may be, to whom this patronage belongs, and\nto keep an eye upon the little affair. But, whatever you do, don't get\nentangled in the concerns of my honored father. The Comte de Maucombe\nis fishing for the title of Marquis for himself; but keep your good\nservices for me, please. When Louis is a deputy--next winter that is--we\nshall come to Paris, and then we will move heaven and earth to get\nsome Government appointment for him, so that we may be able to save our\nincome by living on his salary. My father sits between the centre and\nthe right; a title will content him. Our family was distinguished\neven in the days of King Rene, and Charles X. will hardly say no to a\nMaucombe; but what I fear is that my father may take it into his head to\nask some favor for my younger brother. Now, if the marquisate is dangled\nout of his reach, he will have no thoughts to spare from himself.\n\nJanuary 15th.\n\nAh! Louise, I have been in hell. If I can bear to tell you of my\nanguish, it is because you are another self; even so, I don't know\nwhether I shall ever be able to live again in thought those five ghastly\ndays. The mere word \"convulsions\" makes my very heart sick. Five days!\nto me they were five centuries of torture. A mother who has not been\nthrough this martyrdom does not know what suffering is. So frenzied was\nI that I even envied you, who never had a child!\n\nThe evening before that terrible day the weather was close, almost hot,\nand I thought my little Armand was affected by it. Generally so sweet\nand caressing, he was peevish, cried for nothing, wanted to play, and\nthen broke his toys. Perhaps this sort of fractiousness is the usual\nsign of approaching illness with children. While I was wondering about\nit, I noticed Armand's cheeks flush, but this I set down to teething,\nfor he is cutting four large teeth at once. So I put him to bed beside\nme, and kept constantly waking through the night. He was a little\nfeverish, but not enough to make me uneasy, my mind being still full of\nthe teething. Towards morning he cried \"Mamma!\" and asked by signs for\nsomething to drink; but the cry was spasmodic, and there were convulsive\ntwitchings in the limbs, which turned me to ice. I jumped out of bed to\nfetch him a drink. Imagine my horror when, on my handing him the cup, he\nremained motionless, only repeating \"Mamma!\" in that strange, unfamiliar\nvoice, which was indeed by this time hardly a voice at all. I took his\nhand, but it did not respond to my pressure; it was quite stiff. I put\nthe cup to his lips; the poor little fellow gulped down three or four\nmouthfuls in a convulsive manner that was terrible to see, and the water\nmade a strange sound in his throat. He clung to me desperately, and I\nsaw his eyes roll, as though some hidden force within were pulling at\nthem, till only the whites were visible; his limbs were turning rigid. I\nscreamed aloud, and Louis came.\n\n\"A doctor! quick!... he is dying,\" I cried.\n\nLouis vanished, and my poor Armand again gasped, \"Mamma! Mamma!\" The\nnext moment he lost all consciousness of his mother's existence. The\npretty veins on his forehead swelled, and the convulsions began. For a\nwhole hour before the doctors came, I held in my arms that merry baby,\nall lilies and roses, the blossom of my life, my pride, and my joy,\nlifeless as a piece of wood; and his eyes! I cannot think of them\nwithout horror. My pretty Armand was a mere mummy--black, shriveled,\nmisshapen.\n\nA doctor, two doctors, brought from Marseilles by Louis, hovered about\nlike birds of ill omen; it made me shudder to look at them. One spoke of\nbrain fever, the other saw nothing but an ordinary case of convulsions\nin infancy. Our own country doctor seemed to me to have the most\nsense, for he offered no opinion. \"It's teething,\" said the second\ndoctor.--\"Fever,\" said the first. Finally it was agreed to put leeches\non his neck and ice on his head. It seemed to me like death. To look on,\nto see a corpse, all purple or black, and not a cry, not a movement from\nthis creature but now so full of life and sound--it was horrible!\n\nAt one moment I lost my head, and gave a sort of hysterical laugh, as I\nsaw the pretty neck which I used to devour with kisses, with the leeches\nfeeding on it, and his darling head in a cap of ice. My dear, we had\nto cut those lovely curls, of which we were so proud and with which\nyou used to play, in order to make room for the ice. The convulsions\nreturned every ten minutes with the regularity of labor pains, and then\nthe poor baby writhed and twisted, now white, now violet. His supple\nlimbs clattered like wood as they struck. And this unconscious flesh\nwas the being who smiled and prattled, and used to say Mamma! At the\nthought, a storm of agony swept tumultuously over my soul, like the\nsea tossing in a hurricane. It seemed as though every tie which binds\na child to its mother's heart was strained to rending. My mother, who\nmight have given me help, advice, or comfort, was in Paris. Mothers, it\nis my belief, know more than doctors do about convulsions.\n\nAfter four days and nights of suspense and fear, which almost killed\nme, the doctors were unanimous in advising the application of a horrid\nointment, which would produce open sores. Sores on my Armand! who only\nfive days before was playing about, and laughing, and trying to say\n\"Godmother!\" I would not have it done, preferring to trust in nature.\nLouis, who believes in doctors, scolded me. A man remains the same\nthrough everything. But there are moments when this terrible disease\ntakes the likeness of death, and in one of these it seemed borne in upon\nme that this hateful remedy was the salvation of Armand. Louise, the\nskin was so dry, so rough and parched, that the ointment would not act.\nThen I broke into weeping, and my tears fell so long and so fast, that\nthe bedside was wet through. And the doctors were at dinner!\n\nSeeing myself alone with the child, I stripped him of all medical\nappliances, and seizing him like a mad woman, pressed him to my bosom,\nlaying my forehead against his, and beseeching God to grant him the life\nwhich I was striving to pass into his veins from mine. For some minutes\nI held him thus, longing to die with him, so that neither life nor death\nmight part us. Dear, I felt the limbs relaxing; the writhings ceased,\nthe child stirred, and the ghastly, corpselike tints faded away! I\nscreamed, just as I did when he was taken ill; the doctors hurried up,\nand I pointed to Armand.\n\n\"He is saved!\" exclaimed the oldest of them.\n\nWhat music in those words! The gates of heaven opened! And, in fact, two\nhours later Armand came back to life; but I was utterly crushed, and it\nwas only the healing power of joy which saved me from a serious illness.\nMy God! by what tortures do you bind a mother to her child! To fasten\nhim to our heart, need the nails be driven into the very quick? Was\nI not mother enough before? I, who wept tears of joy over his broken\nsyllables and tottering steps, who spent hours together planning how\nbest to perform my duty, and fit myself for the sweet post of mother?\nWhy these horrors, these ghastly scenes, for a mother who already\nidolized her child?\n\nAs I write, our little Armand is playing, shouting, laughing. What can\nbe the cause of this terrible disease with children? Vainly do I try to\npuzzle it out, remembering that I am again with child. Is it teething?\nIs it some peculiar process in the brain? Is there something wrong with\nthe nervous system of children who are subject to convulsions? All these\nthoughts disquiet me, in view alike of the present and the future.\nOur country doctor holds to the theory of nervous trouble produced by\nteething. I would give every tooth in my head to see little Armand's all\nthrough. The sight of one of those little white pearls peeping out of\nthe swollen gum brings a cold sweat over me now. The heroism with which\nthe little angel bore his sufferings proves to me that he will be his\nmother's son. A look from him goes to my very heart.\n\nMedical science can give no satisfactory explanation as to the origin\nof this sort of tetanus, which passes off as rapidly as it comes on, and\ncan apparently be neither guarded against nor cured. One thing alone, as\nI said before, is certain, that it is hell for a mother to see her child\nin convulsions. How passionately do I clasp him to my heart! I could\nwalk for ever with him in my arms!\n\nTo have suffered all this only six weeks before my confinement made it\nmuch worse; I feared for the coming child. Farewell, my dear beloved.\nDon't wish for a child--there is the sum and substance of my letter!\n\n\n\n\nXLI. THE BARONNE DE MACUMER TO THE VICOMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE Paris.\n\nPoor sweet,--Macumer and I forgave you all your naughtiness when we\nheard of your terrible trouble. I thrilled with pain as I read the\ndetails of the double agony, and there seem compensations now in being\nchildless.\n\nI am writing at once to tell you that Louis has been promoted. He can\nnow wear the ribbon of an officer of the Legion. You are a lucky woman,\nRenee, and you will probably have a little girl, since that used to be\nyour wish!\n\nThe marriage of my brother with Mlle. de Mortsauf was celebrated on our\nreturn. Our gracious King, who really is extraordinarily kind, has given\nmy brother the reversion of the post of first gentleman of the chamber,\nwhich his father-in-law now fills, on the one condition that the\nscutcheon of the Mortsaufs should be placed side by side with that of\nthe Lenoncourts.\n\n\"The office ought to go with the title,\" he said to the Duc de\nLenoncourt-Givry.\n\nMy father is justified a hundred-fold. Without the help of my fortune\nnothing of all this could have taken place. My father and mother came\nfrom Madrid for the wedding, and return there, after the reception which\nI give to-morrow for the bride and bridegroom.\n\nThe carnival will be a very gay one. The Duc and Duchesse de Soria are\nin Paris, and their presence makes me a little uneasy. Marie Heredia is\ncertainly one of the most beautiful women in Europe, and I don't like\nthe way Felipe looks at her. Therefore I am doubly lavish of sweetness\nand caresses. Every look and gesture speak the words which I am careful\nmy lips should not utter, \"_She_ could not love like this!\" Heaven knows\nhow lovely and fascinating I am! Yesterday Mme. de Maufrigneuse said to\nme:\n\n\"Dear child, who can compete with you?\"\n\nThen I keep Felipe so well amused, that his sister-in-law must seem as\nlively as a Spanish cow in comparison. I am the less sorry that a little\nAbencerrage is not on his way, because the Duchess will no doubt stay in\nParis over her confinement, and she won't be a beauty any longer. If\nthe baby is a boy, it will be called Felipe, in honor of the exile.\nAn unkind chance has decreed that I shall, a second time, serve as\ngodmother.\n\nGood-bye, dear, I shall go to Chantepleurs early this year, for our\nItalian tour was shockingly expensive. I shall leave about the end\nof March, and retire to economize in Nivenais. Besides, I am tired of\nParis. Felipe sighs, as I do, after the beautiful quiet of the park, our\ncool meadows, and our Loire, with its sparkling sands, peerless among\nrivers. Chantepleurs will seem delightful to me after the pomps and\nvanities of Italy; for, after all, splendor becomes wearisome, and a\nlover's glance has more beauty than a _capo d'opera_ or a _bel quadro_!\n\nWe shall expect you there. Don't be afraid that I shall be jealous\nagain. You are free to take what soundings you please in Macumer's\nheart, and fish up all the interjections and doubts you can. I am\nsupremely indifferent. Since that day at Rome Felipe's love for me has\ngrown. He told me yesterday (he is looking over my shoulder now) that\nhis sister-in-law, the Princess Heredia, his destined bride of old,\nthe dream of his youth, had no brains. Oh! my dear, I am worse than a\nballet-dancer! If you knew what joy that slighting remark gave me! I\nhave pointed out to Felipe that she does not speak French correctly. She\nsays _esemple_ for _exemple_, _sain_ for _cinq_, _cheu_ for _je_. She is\nbeautiful of course, but quite without charm or the slightest scintilla\nof wit. When a compliment is paid her, she looks at you as though she\ndidn't know what to do with such a strange thing. Felipe, being what he\nis, could not have lived two months with Marie after his marriage.\nDon Fernand, the Duc de Soria, suits her very well. He has generous\ninstincts, but it's easy to see he has been a spoilt child. I am tempted\nto be naughty and make you laugh; but I won't draw the long bow. Ever so\nmuch love, darling.\n\n\n\n\nXLII. RENEE TO LOUISE\n\nMy little girl is two months old. She is called Jeanne-Athenais, and has\nfor godmother and godfather my mother, and an old grand-uncle of Louis'.\n\nAs soon as I possibly can, I shall start for my visit to Chantepleurs,\nsince you are not afraid of a nursing mother. Your godson can say your\nname now; he calls it _Matoumer_, for he can't say _c_ properly. You\nwill be quite delighted with him. He has got all his teeth, and eats\nmeat now like a big boy; he is all over the place, trotting about like\na little mouse; but I watch him all the time with anxious eyes, and it\nmakes me miserable that I cannot keep him by me when I am laid up. The\ntime is more than usually long with me, as the doctors consider some\nspecial precautions necessary. Alas! my child, habit does not inure one\nto child-bearing. There are the same old discomforts and misgivings.\nHowever (don't show this to Felipe), this little girl takes after me,\nand she may yet cut out your Armand.\n\nMy father thought Felipe looking very thin, and my dear pet also not\nquite so blooming. Yet the Duc and Duchesse de Soria have gone; not a\nloophole for jealousy is left! Is there any trouble which you are hiding\nfrom me? Your letter is neither so long nor so full of loving thoughts\nas usual. Is this only a whim of my dear whimsical friend?\n\nI am running on too long. My nurse is angry with me for writing, and\nMlle. Athenais de l'Estorade wants her dinner. Farewell, then; write me\nsome nice long letters.\n\n\n\n\nXLIII. MME. DE MACUMER TO THE COMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE\n\nFor the first time in my life, my dear Renee, I have been alone and\ncrying. I was sitting under a willow, on a wooden bench by the side of\nthe long Chantepleurs marsh. The view there is charming, but it needs\nsome merry children to complete it, and I wait for you. I have been\nmarried nearly three years, and no child! The thought of your quiver\nfull drove me to explore my heart.\n\nAnd this is what I find there. \"Oh! if I had to suffer a hundred-fold\nwhat Renee suffered when my godson was born; if I had to see my child in\nconvulsions, even so would to God that I might have a cherub of my own,\nlike your Athenais!\" I can see her from here in my mind's eye, and\nI know she is beautiful as the day, for you tell me nothing about\nher--that is just like my Renee! I believe you divine my trouble.\n\nEach time my hopes are disappointed, I fall a prey for some days to the\nblackest melancholy. Then I compose sad elegies. When shall I embroider\nlittle caps and sew lace edgings to encircle a tiny head? When choose\nthe cambric for the baby-clothes? Shall I never hear baby lips shout\n\"Mamma,\" and have my dress pulled by a teasing despot whom my heart\nadores? Are there to be no wheelmarks of a little carriage on the\ngravel, no broken toys littered about the courtyard? Shall I never visit\nthe toy-shops, as mothers do, to buy swords, and dolls, and baby-houses?\nAnd will it never be mine to watch the unfolding of a precious\nlife--another Felipe, only more dear? I would have a son, if only to\nlearn how a lover can be more to one in his second self.\n\nMy park and castle are cold and desolate to me. A childless woman is\na monstrosity of nature; we exist only to be mothers. Oh! my sage in\nwoman's livery, how well you have conned the book of life! Everywhere,\ntoo, barrenness is a dismal thing. My life is a little too much like\none of Gessner's or Florian's sheepfolds, which Rivarol longed to see\ninvaded by a wolf. I too have it in me to make sacrifices! There are\nforces in me, I feel, which Felipe has no use for; and if I am not to be\na mother, I must be allowed to indulge myself in some romantic sorrow.\n\nI have just made this remark to my belated Moor, and it brought tears\nto his eyes. He cannot stand any joking on his love, so I let him off\neasily, and only called him a paladin of folly.\n\nAt times I am seized with a desire to go on pilgrimage, to bear my\nlongings to the shrine of some madonna or to a watering-place. Next\nwinter I shall take medical advice. I am too much enraged with myself to\nwrite more. Good-bye.\n\n\n\n\nXLIV. THE SAME TO THE SAME Paris, 1829.\n\nA whole year passed, my dear, without a letter! What does this mean? I\nam a little hurt. Do you suppose that your Louis, who comes to see me\nalmost every alternate day, makes up for you? It is not enough to know\nthat you are well and that everything prospers with you; for I love you,\nRenee, and I want to know what you are feeling and thinking of, just as\nI say everything to you, at the risk of being scolded, or censured, or\nmisunderstood. Your silence and seclusion in the country, at the time\nwhen you might be in Paris enjoying all the Parliamentary honors of\nthe Comte de l'Estorade, cause me serious anxiety. You know that your\nhusband's \"gift of gab\" and unsparing zeal have won for him quite a\nposition here, and he will doubtless receive some very good post when\nthe session is over. Pray, do you spend your life writing him letters of\nadvice? Numa was not so far removed from his Egeria.\n\nWhy did you not take this opportunity of seeing Paris? I might have\nenjoyed your company for four months. Louis told me yesterday that\nyou were coming to fetch him, and would have your third confinement in\nParis--you terrible mother Gigogne! After bombarding Louis with queries,\nexclamations, and regrets, I at last defeated his strategy so far as to\ndiscover that his grand-uncle, the godfather of Athenais, is very ill.\nNow I believe that you, like a careful mother, would be quite equal to\nangling with the member's speeches and fame for a fat legacy from your\nhusband's last remaining relative on the mother's side. Keep your mind\neasy, my Renee--we are all at work for Louis, Lenoncourts, Chaulieus,\nand the whole band of Mme. de Macumer's followers. Martignac will\nprobably put him into the audit department. But if you won't tell me why\nyou bury yourself in the country, I shall be cross.\n\nTell me, are you afraid that the political wisdom of the house of\nl'Estorade should seem to centre in you? Or is it the uncle's legacy?\nPerhaps you were afraid you would be less to your children in Paris? Ah!\nwhat I would give to know whether, after all, you were not simply\ntoo vain to show yourself in Paris for the first time in your present\ncondition! Vain thing! Farewell.\n\n\n\n\nXLV. RENEE TO LOUISE\n\nYou complain of my silence; have you forgotten, then, those two little\nbrown heads, at once my subjects and my tyrants? And as to staying at\nhome, you have yourself hit upon several of my reasons. Apart from the\ncondition of our dear uncle, I didn't want to drag with me to Paris a\nboy of four and a little girl who will soon be three, when I am again\nexpecting my confinement. I had no intention of troubling you and\nupsetting your husband with such a party. I did not care to appear,\nlooking my worst, in the brilliant circle over which you preside, and I\ndetest life in hotels and lodgings.\n\nWhen I come to spend the session in Paris, it will be in my own house.\nLouis' uncle, when he heard of the rank his grand-nephew had received,\nmade me a present of two hundred thousand francs (the half of his\nsavings) with which to buy a house in Paris, and I have charged Louis\nto find one in your neighborhood. My mother has given me thirty thousand\nfrancs for the furnishing, and I shall do my best not to disgrace the\ndear sister of my election--no pun intended.\n\nI am grateful to you for having already done so much at Court for\nLouis. But though M. de Bourmont and M. de Polignac have paid him\nthe compliment of asking him to join their ministry, I do not wish so\nconspicuous a place for him. It would commit him too much; and I prefer\nthe Audit Office because it is permanent. Our affairs here are in very\ngood hands; so you need not fear; as soon as the steward has mastered\nthe details, I will come and support Louis.\n\nAs for writing long letters nowadays, how can I. This one, in which I\nwant to describe to you the daily routine of my life, will be a week on\nthe stocks. Who can tell but Armand may lay hold of it to make caps for\nhis regiments drawn up on my carpet, or vessels for the fleets which\nsail his bath! A single day will serve as a sample of the rest, for they\nare all exactly alike, and their characteristics reduce themselves to\ntwo--either the children are well, or they are not. For me, in this\nsolitary grange, it is no exaggeration to say that hours become minutes,\nor minutes hours, according to the children's health.\n\nIf I have some delightful hours, it is when they are asleep and I am no\nlonger needed to rock the one or soothe the other with stories. When I\nhave them sleeping by my side, I say to myself, \"Nothing can go wrong\nnow.\" The fact is, my sweet, every mother spends her time, so soon\nas her children are out of her sight, in imagining dangers for them.\nPerhaps it is Armand seizing the razors to play with, or his coat taking\nfire, or a snake biting him, or he might tumble in running and start\nan abscess on his head, or he might drown himself in a pond. A mother's\nlife, you see, is one long succession of dramas, now soft and tender,\nnow terrible. Not an hour but has its joys and fears.\n\nBut at night, in my room, comes the hour for waking dreams, when I plan\nout their future, which shines brightly in the smile of the guardian\nangel, watching over their beds. Sometimes Armand calls me in his sleep;\nI kiss his forehead (without rousing him), then his sister's feet,\nand watch them both lying in their beauty. These are my merry-makings!\nYesterday, it must have been our guardian angel who roused me in the\nmiddle of the night and summoned me in fear to Athenais' cradle. Her\nhead was too low, and I found Armand all uncovered, his feet purple with\ncold.\n\n\"Darling mother!\" he cried, rousing up and flinging his arms round me.\n\nThere, dear, is one of our night scenes for you.\n\nHow important it is for a mother to have her children by her side at\nnight! It is not for a nurse, however careful she may be, to take\nthem up, comfort them, and hush them to sleep again, when some horrid\nnightmare has disturbed them. For they have their dreams, and the task\nof explaining away one of those dread visions of the night is the more\narduous because the child is scared, stupid, and only half awake. It is\na mere interlude in the unconsciousness of slumber. In this way I have\ncome to sleep so lightly, that I can see my little pair and see them\nstirring, through the veil of my eyelids. A sigh or a rustle wakens me.\nFor me, the demon of convulsions is ever crouching by their beds.\n\nSo much for the nights; with the first twitter of the birds my babies\nbegin to stir. Through the mists of dispersing sleep, their chatter\nblends with the warblings that fill the morning air, or with the\nswallows' noisy debates--little cries of joy or woe, which make their\nway to my heart rather than my ears. While Nais struggles to get at\nme, making the passage from her cradle to my bed on all fours or with\nstaggering steps, Armand climbs up with the agility of a monkey, and has\nhis arms round me. Then the merry couple turn my bed into a playground,\nwhere mother lies at their mercy. The baby-girl pulls my hair, and would\ntake to sucking again, while Armand stands guard over my breast,\nas though defending his property. Their funny ways, their peals of\nlaughter, are too much for me, and put sleep fairly to flight.\n\nThen we play the ogress game; mother ogress eats up the white, soft\nflesh with hugs, and rains kisses on those rosy shoulders and eyes\nbrimming over with saucy mischief; we have little jealous tiffs too, so\npretty to see. It has happened to me, dear, to take up my stockings at\neight o'clock and be still bare-footed at nine!\n\nThen comes the getting up. The operation of dressing begins. I slip on\nmy dressing-gown, turn up my sleeves, and don the mackintosh apron; with\nMary's assistance, I wash and scrub my two little blossoms. I am sole\narbiter of the temperature of the bath, for a good half of children's\ncrying and whimpering comes from mistakes here. The moment has arrived\nfor paper fleets and glass ducks, since the only way to get children\nthoroughly washed is to keep them well amused. If you knew the\ndiversions that have to be invented before these despotic sovereigns\nwill permit a soft sponge to be passed over every nook and cranny, you\nwould be awestruck at the amount of ingenuity and intelligence demanded\nby the maternal profession when one takes it seriously. Prayers,\nscoldings, promises, are alike in requisition; above all, the jugglery\nmust be so dexterous that it defies detection. The case would be\ndesperate had not Providence to the cunning of the child matched that\nof the mother. A child is a diplomatist, only to be mastered, like the\ndiplomatists of the great world, through his passions! Happily, it takes\nlittle to make these cherubs laugh; the fall of a brush, a piece of soap\nslipping from the hand, and what merry shouts! And if our triumphs are\ndearly bought, still triumphs they are, though hidden from mortal\neye. Even the father knows nothing of it all. None but God and His\nangels--and perhaps you--can fathom the glances of satisfaction which\nMary and I exchange when the little creatures' toilet is at last\nconcluded, and they stand, spotless and shining, amid a chaos of soap,\nsponges, combs, basins, blotting-paper, flannel, and all the nameless\nlitter of a true English \"nursery.\"\n\nFor I am so far a convert as to admit that English women have a talent\nfor this department. True, they look upon the child only from the point\nof view of material well-being; but where this is concerned, their\narrangements are admirable. My children must always be bare-legged and\nwear woollen socks. There shall be no swaddling nor bandages; on the\nother hand, they shall never be left alone. The helplessness of\nthe French infant in its swaddling-bands means the liberty of the\nnurse--that is the whole explanation. A mother, who is really a mother,\nis never free.\n\nThere is my answer to your question why I do not write. Besides the\nmanagement of the estate, I have the upbringing of two children on my\nhands.\n\nThe art of motherhood involves much silent, unobtrusive self-denial,\nan hourly devotion which finds no detail too minute. The soup warming\nbefore the fire must be watched. Am I the kind of woman, do you suppose,\nto shirk such cares? The humblest task may earn a rich harvest of\naffection. How pretty is a child's laugh when he finds the food to his\nliking! Armand has a way of nodding his head when he is pleased that\nis worth a lifetime of adoration. How could I leave to any one else the\nprivilege and delight, as well as the responsibility, of blowing on the\nspoonful of soup which is too hot for my little Nais, my nursling\nof seven months ago, who still remembers my breast? When a nurse has\nallowed a child to burn its tongue and lips with scalding food, she\ntells the mother, who hurries up to see what is wrong, that the child\ncried from hunger. How could a mother sleep in peace with the thought\nthat a breath, less pure than her own, has cooled her child's food--the\nmother whom Nature has made the direct vehicle of food to infant lips.\nTo mince a chop for Nais, who has just cut her last teeth, and mix the\nmeat, cooked to a turn, with potatoes, is a work of patience, and there\nare times, indeed, when none but a mother could succeed in making an\nimpatient child go through with its meal.\n\nNo number of servants, then, and no English nurse can dispense a mother\nfrom taking the field in person in that daily contest, where gentleness\nalone should grapple with the little griefs and pains of childhood.\nLouise, the care of these innocent darlings is a work to engage the\nwhole soul. To whose hand and eyes, but one's own, intrust the task of\nfeeding, dressing, and putting to bed? Broadly speaking, a crying child\nis the unanswerable condemnation of mother or nurse, except when the cry\nis the outcome of natural pain. Now that I have two to look after (and\na third on the road), they occupy all my thoughts. Even you, whom I love\nso dearly, have become a memory to me.\n\nMy own dressing is not always completed by two o'clock. I have no faith\nin mothers whose rooms are in apple-pie order, and who themselves might\nhave stepped out of a bandbox. Yesterday was one of those lovely days\nof early April, and I wanted to take my children for a walk, while I was\nstill able--for the warning bell is in my ears. Such an expedition is\nquite an epic to a mother! One dreams of it the night before! Armand was\nfor the first time to put on a little black velvet jacket, a new collar\nwhich I had worked, a Scotch cap with the Stuart colors and cock's\nfeathers; Nais was to be in white and pink, with one of those delicious\nlittle baby caps; for she is a baby still, though she will lose that\npretty title on the arrival of the impatient youngster, whom I call my\nbeggar, for he will have the portion of a younger son. (You see, Louise,\nthe child has already appeared to me in a vision, so I know it is a\nboy.)\n\nWell, caps, collars, jackets, socks, dainty little shoes, pink garters,\nthe muslin frock with silk embroidery,--all was laid out on my bed. Then\nthe little brown heads had to be brushed, twittering merrily all the\ntime like birds, answering each other's call. Armand's hair is in curls,\nwhile Nais' is brought forward softly on the forehead as a border to the\npink-and-white cap. Then the shoes are buckled; and when the little\nbare legs and well-shod feet have trotted off to the nursery, while\ntwo shining faces (_clean_, Mary calls them) and eyes ablaze with life\npetition me to start, my heart beats fast. To look on the children whom\none's own hand has arrayed, the pure skin brightly veined with blue,\nthat one has bathed, laved, and sponged and decked with gay colors of\nsilk or velvet--why, there is no poem comes near to it! With what eager,\ncovetous longing one calls them back for one more kiss on those white\nnecks, which, in their simple collars, the loveliest woman cannot rival.\nEven the coarsest lithograph of such a scene makes a mother pause, and I\nfeast my eyes daily on the living picture!\n\nOnce out of doors, triumphant in the result of my labors, while I was\nadmiring the princely air with which little Armand helped baby to totter\nalong the path you know, I saw a carriage coming, and tried to get them\nout of the way. The children tumbled into a dirty puddle, and lo! my\nworks of art are ruined! We had to take them back and change their\nthings. I took the little one in my arms, never thinking of my own\ndress, which was ruined, while Mary seized Armand, and the cavalcade\nre-entered. With a crying baby and a soaked child, what mind has a\nmother left for herself?\n\nDinner time arrives, and as a rule I have done nothing. Now comes the\nproblem which faces me twice every day--how to suffice in my own person\nfor two children, put on their bibs, turn up their sleeves, and get\nthem to eat. In the midst of these ever-recurring cares, joys, and\ncatastrophes, the only person neglected in the house is myself. If the\nchildren have been naughty, often I don't get rid of my curl-papers\nall day. Their tempers rule my toilet. As the price of a few minutes\nin which I write you these half-dozen pages, I have had to let them\ncut pictures out of my novels, build castles with books, chessmen, or\nmother-of-pearl counters, and give Nais my silks and wools to arrange\nin her own fashion, which, I assure you, is so complicated, that she is\nentirely absorbed in it, and has not uttered a word.\n\nYet I have nothing to complain of. My children are both strong and\nindependent; they amuse themselves more easily then you would think.\nThey find delight in everything; a guarded liberty is worth many toys.\nA few pebbles--pink, yellow, purple, and black, small shells, the\nmysteries of sand, are a world of pleasure to them. Their wealth\nconsists in possessing a multitude of small things. I watch Armand and\nfind him talking to the flowers, the flies, the chickens, and imitating\nthem. He is on friendly terms with insects, and never wearies of\nadmiring them. Everything which is on a minute scale interests them.\nArmand is beginning to ask the \"why\" of everything he sees. He has come\nto ask what I am saying to his godmother, whom he looks on as a fairy.\nStrange how children hit the mark!\n\nAlas! my sweet, I would not sadden you with the tale of my joys. Let me\ngive you some notion of your godson's character. The other day we were\nfollowed by a poor man begging--beggars soon find out that a mother with\nher child at her side can't resist them. Armand has no idea what hunger\nis, and money is a sealed book to him; but I have just bought him a\ntrumpet which had long been the object of his desires. He held it out to\nthe old man with a kingly air, saying:\n\n\"Here, take this!\"\n\nWhat joy the world can give would compare with such a moment?\n\n\"May I keep it?\" said the poor man to me. \"I too, madame, have had\nchildren,\" he added, hardly noticing the money I put into his hand.\n\nI shudder when I think that Armand must go to school, and that I have\nonly three years and a half more to keep him by me. The flowers that\nblossom in his sunny childhood will fall before the scythe of a public\nschool system; his gracious ways and bewitching candor will lose their\nspontaneity. They will cut the curls that I have brushed and smoothed\nand kissed so often! What will they do with the thinking being that is\nArmand?\n\nAnd what of you? You tell me nothing of your life. Are you still in\nlove with Felipe? For, as regards the Saracen, I have no uneasiness.\nGood-bye; Nais has just had a tumble, and if I run on like this, my\nletter will become a volume.\n\n\n\n\nXLVI. MME. DE MACUMER TO THE COMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE 1829.\n\nMy sweet, tender Renee, you will have learned from the papers the\nterrible calamity which has overwhelmed me. I have not been able to\nwrite you even a word. For twenty days I never left his bedside; I\nreceived his last breath and closed his eyes; I kept holy watch over him\nwith the priests and repeated the prayers for the dead. The cruel pangs\nI suffered were accepted by me as a rightful punishment; and yet, when\nI saw on his calm lips the smile which was his last farewell to me, how\nwas it possible to believe that I had caused his death!\n\nBe it so or not, he is gone, and I am left. To you, who have known us\nboth so well, what more need I say? These words contain all. Oh! I would\ngive my share of Heaven to hear the flattering tale that my prayers have\npower to bring him back to life! To see him again, to have him once more\nmine, were it only for a second, would mean that I could draw breath\nagain without mortal agony. Will you not come soon and soothe me with\nsuch promises? Is not your love strong enough to deceive me?\n\nBut stay! it was you who told me beforehand that he would suffer through\nme. Was it so indeed? Yes, it is true, I had no right to his love. Like\na thief, I took what was not mine, and my frenzied grasp has crushed\nthe life out of my bliss. The madness is over now, but I feel that I am\nalone. Merciful God! what torture of the damned can exceed the misery in\nthat word?\n\nWhen they took him away from me, I lay down on the same bed and hoped to\ndie. There was but a door between us, and it seemed to me I had strength\nto force it! But, alas! I was too young for death; and after forty days,\nduring which, with cruel care and all the sorry inventions of medical\nscience, they slowly nursed me back to life, I find myself in the\ncountry, seated by my window, surrounded with lovely flowers, which he\nmade to bloom for me, gazing on the same splendid view over which\nhis eyes have so often wandered, and which he was so proud to have\ndiscovered, since it gave me pleasure. Ah! dear Renee, no words can tell\nhow new surroundings hurt when the heart is dead. I shiver at the sight\nof the moist earth in my garden, for the earth is a vast tomb, and it\nis almost as though I walked on _him_! When I first went out, I trembled\nwith fear and could not move. It was so sad to see his flowers, and he\nnot there!\n\nMy father and mother are in Spain. You know what my brothers are, and\nyou yourself are detained in the country. But you need not be uneasy\nabout me; two angels of mercy flew to my side. The Duc and the Duchesse\nde Soria hastened to their brother in his illness, and have been\neverything that heart could wish. The last few nights before the end\nfound the three of us gathered, in calm and wordless grief, round the\nbed where this great man was breathing his last, a man among a thousand,\nrare in any age, head and shoulders above the rest of us in everything.\nThe patient resignation of my Felipe was angelic. The sight of his\nbrother and Marie gave him a moment's pleasure and easing of his pain.\n\n\"Darling,\" he said to me with the simple frankness which never deserted\nhim, \"I had almost gone from life without leaving to Fernand the Barony\nof Macumer; I must make a new will. My brother will forgive me; he knows\nwhat it is to love!\"\n\nI owe my life to the care of my brother-in-law and his wife; they want\nto carry me off to Spain!\n\nAh! Renee, to no one but you can I speak freely of my grief. A sense of\nmy own faults weighs me to the ground, and there is a bitter solace in\npouring them out to you, poor, unheeded Cassandra. The exactions, the\npreposterous jealousy, the nagging unrest of my passion wore him to\ndeath. My love was the more fraught with danger for him because we had\nboth the same exquisitely sensitive nature, we spoke the same language,\nnothing was lost on him, and often the mocking shaft, so carelessly\ndischarged, went straight to his heart. You can have no idea of the\npoint to which he carried submissiveness. I had only to tell him to go\nand leave me alone, and the caprice, however wounding to him, would be\nobeyed without a murmur. His last breath was spent in blessing me and in\nrepeating that a single morning alone with me was more precious to him\nthan a lifetime spent with another woman, were she even the Marie of his\nyouth. My tears fall as I write the words.\n\nThis is the manner of my life now. I rise at midday and go to bed\nat seven; I linger absurdly long over meals; I saunter about slowly,\nstanding motionless, an hour at a time, before a single plant; I gaze\ninto the leafy trees; I take a sober and serious interest in mere\nnothings; I long for shade, silence, and night; in a word, I fight\nthrough each hour as it comes, and take a gloomy pleasure in adding it\nto the heap of the vanquished. My peaceful park gives me all the company\nI care for; everything there is full of glorious images of my vanished\njoy, invisible for others but eloquent to me.\n\n\"I cannot away with you Spaniards!\" I exclaimed one morning, as my\nsister-in-law flung herself on my neck. \"You have some nobility that we\nlack.\"\n\nAh! Renee, if I still live, it is doubtless because Heaven tempers the\nsense of affliction to the strength of those who have to bear it. Only a\nwoman can know what it is to lose a love which sprang from the heart and\nwas genuine throughout, a passion which was not ephemeral, and satisfied\nat once the spirit and the flesh. How rare it is to find a man so gifted\nthat to worship him brings no sense of degradation! If such supreme\nfortune befall us once, we cannot hope for it a second time. Men of true\ngreatness, whose strength and worth are veiled by poetic grace, and who\ncharm by some high spiritual power, men made to be adored, beware of\nlove! Love will ruin you, and ruin the woman of your heart. This is the\nburden of my cry as I pace my woodland walks.\n\nAnd he has left me no child! That love so rich in smiles, which rained\nperpetual flowers and joy, has left no fruit. I am a thing accursed. Can\nit be that, even as the two extremes of polar ice and torrid sand\nare alike intolerant of life, so the very purity and vehemence of a\nsingle-hearted passion render it barren as hate? Is it only a marriage\nof reason, such as yours, which is blessed with a family? Can Heaven be\njealous of our passions? There are wild words.\n\nYou are, I believe, the one person whose company I could endure. Come to\nme, then; none but Renee should be with Louise in her sombre garb.\nWhat a day when I first put on my widow's bonnet! When I saw myself all\narrayed in black, I fell back on a seat and wept till night came; and I\nweep again as I recall that moment of anguish.\n\nGood-bye. Writing tires me; thoughts crowd fast, but I have no heart\nto put them into words. Bring your children; you can nurse baby here\nwithout making me jealous; all that is gone, _he_ is not here, and I\nshall be very glad to see my godson. Felipe used to wish for a child\nlike little Armand. Come, then, come and help me to bear my woe.\n\n\n\n\nXLVII. RENEE TO LOUISE 1829.\n\nMy darling,--When you hold this letter in your hands, I shall be already\nnear, for I am starting a few minutes after it. We shall be alone\ntogether. Louis is obliged to remain in Provence because of the\napproaching elections. He wants to be elected again, and the Liberals\nare already plotting against his return.\n\nI don't come to comfort you; I only bring you my heart to beat in\nsympathy with yours, and help you to bear with life. I come to bid you\nweep, for only with tears can you purchase the joy of meeting him again.\nRemember, he is traveling towards Heaven, and every step forward which\nyou take brings you nearer to him. Every duty done breaks a link in the\nchain that keeps you apart.\n\nLouise, in my arms you will once more raise your head and go on your way\nto him, pure, noble, washed of all those errors, which had no root in\nyour heart, and bearing with you the harvest of good deeds which, in his\nname, you will accomplish here.\n\nI scribble these hasty lines in all the bustle of preparation, and\ninterrupted by the babies and by Armand, who keeps saying, \"Godmother,\ngodmother! I want to see her,\" till I am almost jealous. He might be\nyour child!\n\n\n\n\n\nSECOND PART\n\n\n\n\nXLVIII. THE BARONNE DE MACUMER TO THE COMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE October 15,\n1833.\n\nYes, Renee, it is quite true; you have been correctly informed. I\nhave sold my house, I have sold Chantepleurs, and the farms in\nSeine-et-Marne, but no more, please! I am neither mad nor ruined, I\nassure you.\n\nLet us go into the matter. When everything was wound up, there remained\nto me of my poor Macumer's fortune about twelve hundred thousand francs.\nI will account, as to a practical sister, for every penny of this.\n\nI put a million in the Three per Cents when they were at fifty, and so\nI have got an income for myself of sixty thousand francs, instead of\nthe thirty thousand which the property yielded. Then, only think what\nmy life was. Six months of the year in the country, renewing leases,\nlistening to the grumbles of the farmers, who pay when it pleases them,\nand getting as bored as a sportsman in wet weather. There was produce\nto sell, and I always sold it at a loss. Then, in Paris, my house\nrepresented a rental of ten thousand francs; I had to invest my money\nat the notaries; I was kept waiting for the interest, and could only\nget the money back by prosecuting; in addition I had to study the law of\nmortgage. In short, there was business in Nivernais, in Seine-et-Marne,\nin Paris--and what a burden, what a nuisance, what a vexing and losing\ngame for a widow of twenty-seven!\n\nWhereas now my fortune is secured on the Budget. In place of paying\ntaxes to the State, I receive from it, every half-year, in my own\nperson, and free from cost, thirty thousand francs in thirty notes,\nhanded over the counter to me by a dapper little clerk at the Treasury,\nwho smiles when he sees me coming!\n\nSupposing the nation went bankrupt? Well, to begin with:\n\n  'Tis not mine to see trouble so far from my door.\n\nAt the worst, too, the nation would not dock me of more than half my\nincome, so I should still be as well off as before my investment, and\nin the meantime I shall be drawing a double income until the catastrophe\narrives. A nation doesn't become bankrupt more than once in a century,\nso I shall have plenty of time to amass a little capital out of my\nsavings.\n\nAnd finally, is not the Comte de l'Estorade a peer of this July\nsemi-republic? Is he not one of those pillars of royalty offered by the\n\"people\" to the King of the French? How can I have qualms with a friend\nat Court, a great financier, head of the Audit Department? I defy you to\narraign my sanity! I am almost as good at sums as your citizen king.\n\nDo you know what inspires a woman with all this arithmetic? Love, my\ndear!\n\nAlas! the moment has come for unfolding to you the mysteries of my\nconduct, the motives of which have baffled even your keen sight, your\nprying affection, and your subtlety. I am to be married in a country\nvillage near Paris. I love and am loved. I love as much as a woman can\nwho knows love well. I am loved as much as a woman ought to be by the\nman she adores.\n\nForgive me, Renee, for keeping this a secret from you and from every\none. If your friend evades all spies and puts curiosity on a false\ntrack, you must admit that my feeling for poor Macumer justified some\ndissimulation. Besides, de l'Estorade and you would have deafened me\nwith remonstrances, and plagued me to death with your misgivings, to\nwhich the facts might have lent some color. You know, if no one else\ndoes, to what pitch my jealousy can go, and all this would only have\nbeen useless torture to me. I was determined to carry out, on my own\nresponsibility, what you, Renee, will call my insane project, and I\nwould take counsel only with my own head and heart, for all the world\nlike a schoolgirl giving the slip to her watchful parents.\n\nThe man I love possesses nothing but thirty thousand francs' worth of\ndebts, which I have paid. What a theme for comment here! You would have\ntried to make Gaston out an adventurer; your husband would have set\ndetectives on the dear boy. I preferred to sift him for myself. He\nhas been wooing me now close on two years. I am twenty-seven, he is\ntwenty-three. The difference, I admit, is huge when it is on the wrong\nside. Another source of lamentation!\n\nLastly, he is a poet, and has lived by his trade--that is to say, on\nnext to nothing, as you will readily understand. Being a poet, he has\nspent more time weaving day-dreams, and basking, lizard-like, in the\nsun, than scribing in his dingy garret. Now, practical people have a way\nof tarring with the same brush of inconstancy authors, artists, and in\ngeneral all men who live by their brains. Their nimble and fertile wit\nlays them open to the charge of a like agility in matters of the heart.\n\nSpite of the debts, spite of the difference in age, spite of the poetry,\nan end is to be placed in a few days to a heroic resistance of more than\nnine months, during which he has not been allowed even to kiss my hand,\nand so also ends the season of our sweet, pure love-making. This is not\nthe mere surrender of a raw, ignorant, and curious girl, as it was eight\nyears ago; the gift is deliberate, and my lover awaits it with such\nloyal patience that, if I pleased, I could postpone the marriage for\na year. There is no servility in this; love's slave he may be, but the\nheart is not slavish. Never have I seen a man of nobler feeling, or\none whose tenderness was more rich in fancy, whose love bore more the\nimpress of his soul. Alas! my sweet one, the art of love is his by\nheritage. A few words will tell his story.\n\nMy friend has no other name than Marie Gaston. He is the illegitimate\nson of the beautiful Lady Brandon, whose fame must have reached you,\nand who died broken-hearted, a victim to the vengeance of Lady Dudley--a\nghastly story of which the dear boy knows nothing. Marie Gaston was\nplaced by his brother Louis in a boarding-school at Tours, where he\nremained till 1827. Louis, after settling his brother at school, sailed\na few days later for foreign parts \"to seek his fortune,\" to use the\nwords of an old woman who had played the part of Providence to him.\nThis brother turned sailor used to write him, at long intervals, letters\nquite fatherly in tone, and breathing a noble spirit; but a struggling\nlife never allowed him to return home. His last letter told Marie that\nhe had been appointed Captain in the navy of some American republic, and\nexhorted him to hope for better days.\n\nAlas! since then three years have passed, and my poor poet has never\nheard again. So dearly did he love his brother, that he would have\nstarted to look for him but for Daniel d'Arthez, the well-known author,\nwho took a generous interest in Marie Gaston, and prevented him carrying\nout his mad impulse. Nor was this all; often would he give him a crust\nand a corner, as the poet puts it in his graphic words.\n\nFor, in truth, the poor lad was in terrible straits; he was actually\ninnocent enough to believe--incredible as it seems--that genius was the\nshortest road to fortune, and from 1828 to 1833 his one aim has been to\nmake a name for himself in letters. Naturally his life was a frightful\ntissue of toil and hardships, alternating between hope and despair. The\ngood advice of d'Arthez could not prevail against the allurements of\nambition, and his debts went on growing like a snowball. Still he\nwas beginning to come into notice when I happened to meet him at Mme.\nd'Espard's. At first sight he inspired me, unconsciously to himself,\nwith the most vivid sympathy. How did it come about that this virgin\nheart has been left for me? The fact is that my poet combines genius and\ncleverness, passion and pride, and women are always afraid of greatness\nwhich has no weak side to it. How many victories were needed before\nJosephine could see the great Napoleon in the little Bonaparte whom she\nhad married.\n\nPoor Gaston is innocent enough to think he knows the measure of my love!\nHe simply has not an idea of it, but to you I must make it clear;\nfor this letter, Renee, is something in the nature of a last will and\ntestament. Weigh well what I am going to say, I beg of you.\n\nAt this moment I am confident of being loved as perhaps not another\nwomen on this earth, nor have I a shadow of doubt as to the perfect\nhappiness of our wedded life, to which I bring a feeling hitherto\nunknown to me. Yes, for the first time in my life, I know the delight\nof being swayed by passion. That which every woman seeks in love will\nbe mine in marriage. As poor Felipe once adored me, so do I now adore\nGaston. I have lost control of myself, I tremble before this boy as the\nArab hero used to tremble before me. In a word, the balance of love is\nnow on my side, and this makes me timid. I am full of the most absurd\nterrors. I am afraid of being deserted, afraid of becoming old and ugly\nwhile Gaston still retains his youth and beauty, afraid of coming short\nof his hopes!\n\nAnd yet I believe I have it in me, I believe I have sufficient devotion\nand ability, not only to keep alive the flame of his love in our\nsolitary life, far from the world, but even to make it burn stronger and\nbrighter. If I am mistaken, if this splendid idyl of love in hiding must\ncome to an end--an end! what am I saying?--if I find Gaston's love less\nintense any day than it was the evening before, be sure of this, Renee,\nI should visit my failure only on myself; no blame should attach to him.\nI tell you now it would mean my death. Not even if I had children could\nI live on these terms, for I know myself, Renee, I know that my nature\nis the lover's rather than the mother's. Therefore before taking this\nvow upon my soul, I implore you, my Renee, if this disaster befall me,\nto take the place of mother to my children; let them be my legacy to\nyou! All that I know of you, your blind attachment to duty, your rare\ngifts, your love of children, your affection for me, would help to make\nmy death--I dare not say easy--but at least less bitter.\n\nThe compact I have thus made with myself adds a vague terror to the\nsolemnity of my marriage ceremony. For this reason I wish to have no one\nwhom I know present, and it will be performed in secret. Let my heart\nfail me if it will, at least I shall not read anxiety in your dear eyes,\nand I alone shall know that this new marriage-contract which I sign may\nbe my death warrant.\n\nI shall not refer again to this agreement entered into between my\npresent self and the self I am to be. I have confided it to you in\norder that you might know the full extent of your responsibilities. In\nmarrying I retain full control of my property; and Gaston, while aware\nthat I have enough to secure a comfortable life for both of us, is\nignorant of its amount. Within twenty-four hours I shall dispose of it\nas I please; and in order to save him from a humiliating position, I\nshall have stock, bringing in twelve thousand francs a year, assigned\nto him. He will find this in his desk on the eve of our wedding. If\nhe declined to accept, I should break off the whole thing. I had to\nthreaten a rupture to get his permission to pay his debts.\n\nThis long confession has tired me. I shall finish it the day after\nto-morrow; I have to spend to-morrow in the country.\n\nOctober 20th.\n\nI will tell you now the steps I have taken to insure secrecy. My object\nhas been to ward off every possible incitement to my ever-wakeful\njealousy, in imitation of the Italian princess, who, like a lioness\nrushing on her prey, carried it off to some Swiss town to devour in\npeace. And I confide my plans to you because I have another favor to\nbeg; namely, that you will respect our solitude and never come to see us\nuninvited.\n\nTwo years ago I purchased a small property overlooking the ponds of\nVille d'Avray, on the road to Versailles. It consists of twenty acres\nof meadow land, the skirts of a wood, and a fine fruit garden. Below\nthe meadows the land has been excavated so as to make a lakelet of about\nthree acres in extent, with a charming little island in the middle. The\nsmall valley is shut in by two graceful, thickly-wooded slopes, where\nrise delicious springs that water my park by means of channels cleverly\ndisposed by my architect. Finally, they fall into the royal ponds,\nglimpses of which can be seen here and there, gleaming in the distance.\nMy little park has been admirably laid out by the architect, who has\nsurrounded it by hedges, walls, or ha-has, according to the lie of the\nland, so that no possible point of view may be lost.\n\nA chalet has been built for me half-way up the hillside, with a charming\nexposure, having the woods of the Ronce on either side, and in front a\ngrassy slope running down to the lake. Externally the chalet is an exact\ncopy of those which are so much admired by travelers on the road from\nSion to Brieg, and which fascinated me when I was returning from Italy.\nThe internal decorations will bear comparison with those of the most\ncelebrated buildings of the kind.\n\nA hundred paces from this rustic dwelling stands a charming and\nornamental house, communicating with it by a subterranean passage.\nThis contains the kitchen, and other servants' rooms, stables, and\ncoach-houses. Of all this series of brick buildings, the facade alone\nis seen, graceful in its simplicity, against a background of shrubbery.\nAnother building serves to lodge the gardeners and masks the entrance to\nthe orchards and kitchen-gardens.\n\nThe entrance gate to the property is so hidden in the wall dividing the\npark from the wood as almost to defy detection. The plantations, already\nwell grown, will, in two or three years, completely hide the buildings,\nso that, except in winter, when the trees are bare, no trace of\nhabitation will appear to the outside world, save only the smoke visible\nfrom the neighboring hills.\n\nThe surroundings of my chalet have been modeled on what is called the\nKing's Garden at Versailles, but it has an outlook on my lakelet and\nisland. The hills on every side display their abundant foliage--those\nsplendid trees for which your new civil list has so well cared. My\ngardeners have orders to cultivate new sweet-scented flowers to any\nextent, and no others, so that our home will be a fragrant emerald. The\nchalet, adorned with a wild vine which covers the roof, is literally\nembedded in climbing plants of all kinds--hops, clematis, jasmine,\nazalea, copaea. It will be a sharp eye which can descry our windows!\n\nThe chalet, my dear, is a good, solid house, with its heating system and\nall the conveniences of modern architecture, which can raise a palace in\nthe compass of a hundred square feet. It contains a suite of rooms for\nGaston and another for me. The ground-floor is occupied by an ante-room,\na parlor, and a dining room. Above our floor again are three rooms\ndestined for the nurseries. I have five first-rate horses, a small light\ncoupe, and a two-horse cabriolet. We are only forty-minutes' drive from\nParis; so that, when the spirit moves us to hear an opera or see a new\nplay, we can start after dinner and return the same night to our bower.\nThe road is a good one, and passes under the shade of our green dividing\nwall.\n\nMy servants--cook, coachman, groom, and gardeners, in addition to my\nmaid--are all very respectable people, whom I have spent the last six\nmonths in picking up, and they will be superintended by my old Philippe.\nAlthough confident of their loyalty and good faith, I have not neglected\nto cultivate self-interest; their wages are small, but will receive an\nannual addition in the shape of a New Year's Day present. They are all\naware that the slightest fault, or a mere suspicion of gossiping,\nmight lose them a capital place. Lovers are never troublesome to their\nservants; they are indulgent by disposition, and therefore I feel that I\ncan reckon on my household.\n\nAll that is choice, pretty, or decorative in my house in the Rue du\nBac has been transported to the chalet. The Rembrandt hangs on the\nstaircase, as though it were a mere daub; the Hobbema faces the Rubens\nin _his_ study; the Titian, which my sister-in-law Mary sent me from\nMadrid, adorns the boudoir. The beautiful furniture picked up by Felipe\nlooks very well in the parlor, which the architect has decorated most\ntastefully. Everything at the chalet is charmingly simple, with the\nsimplicity which can't be got under a hundred thousand francs. Our\nground-floor rests on cellars, which are built of millstone and embedded\nin concrete; it is almost completely buried in flowers and shrubs, and\nis deliciously cool without a vestige of damp. To complete the picture,\na fleet of white swans sail over my lake!\n\nOh! Renee, the silence which reigns in this valley would bring joy to\nthe dead! One is awakened by the birds singing or the breeze rustling in\nthe poplars. A little spring, discovered by the architect in digging the\nfoundations of the wall, trickles down the hillside over silvery sand\nto the lake, between two banks of water-cress, hugging the edge of the\nwoods. I know nothing that money can buy to equal it.\n\nMay not Gaston come to loathe this too perfect bliss? I shudder to think\nhow complete it is, for the ripest fruits harbor the worms, the most\ngorgeous flowers attract the insects. Is it not ever the monarch of the\nforest which is eaten away by the fatal brown grub, greedy as death?\nI have learned before now that an unseen and jealous power attacks\nhappiness which has reached perfection. Besides, this is the moral of\nall your preaching, and you have been proved a prophet.\n\nWhen I went, the day before yesterday, to see whether my last whim had\nbeen carried out, tears rose to my eyes; and, to the great surprise of\nmy architect, I at once passed his account for payment.\n\n\"But, madame,\" he exclaimed, \"your man of business will refuse to pay\nthis; it is a matter of three hundred thousand francs.\" My only reply\nwas to add the words, \"To be paid without question,\" with the bearing of\na seventeenth-century Chaulieu.\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"there is one condition to my gratitude. No human being\nmust hear from you of the park and buildings. Promise me, on your honor,\nto observe this article in our contract--not to breathe to a soul the\nproprietor's name.\"\n\nNow, can you understand the meaning of my sudden journeys, my mysterious\ncomings and goings? Now, do you know whither those beautiful things,\nwhich the world supposes to be sold, have flown? Do you perceive the\nultimate motive of my change of investment? Love, my dear, is a vast\nbusiness, and they who would succeed in it should have no other.\nHenceforth I shall have no more trouble from money matters; I have taken\nall the thorns out of my life, and done my housekeeping work once for\nall with a vengeance, so as never to be troubled with it again, except\nduring the daily ten minutes which I shall devote to my old major-domo\nPhilippe. I have made a study of life and its sharp curves; there came\na day when death also gave me harsh lessons. Now I want to turn all this\nto account. My one occupation will be to please _him_ and love _him_, to\nbrighten with variety what to common mortals is monotonously dull.\n\nGaston is still in complete ignorance. At my request he has, like\nmyself, taken up his quarters at Ville d'Avray; to-morrow we start for\nthe chalet. Our life there will cost but little; but if I told you the\nsum I am setting aside for my toilet, you would exclaim at my madness,\nand with reason. I intend to take as much trouble to make myself\nbeautiful for him every day as other women do for society. My dress in\nthe country, year in, year out, will cost twenty-four thousand francs,\nand the larger portion of this will not go in day costumes. As for him,\nhe can wear a blouse if he pleases! Don't suppose that I am going to\nturn our life into an amorous duel and wear myself out in devices for\nfeeding passion; all that I want is to have a conscience free from\nreproach. Thirteen years still lie before me as a pretty woman, and I\nam determined to be loved on the last day of the thirteenth even more\nfondly than on the morrow of our mysterious nuptials. This time no\ncutting words shall mar my lowly, grateful content. I will take the part\nof servant, since that of mistress throve so ill with me before.\n\nAh! Renee, if Gaston has sounded, as I have, the heights and depths of\nlove, my happiness is assured! Nature at the chalet wears her fairest\nface. The woods are charming; each step opens up to you some fresh\nvista of cool greenery, which delights the soul by the sweet thoughts it\nwakens. They breathe of love. If only this be not the gorgeous theatre\ndressed by my hand for my own martyrdom!\n\nIn two days from now I shall be Mme. Gaston. My God! is it fitting a\nChristian so to love mortal man?\n\n\"Well, at least you have the law with you,\" was the comment of my man\nof business, who is to be one of my witnesses, and who exclaimed, on\ndiscovering why my property was to be realized, \"I am losing a client!\"\n\nAnd you, my sweetheart (whom I dare no longer call my loved one), may\nyou not cry, \"I am losing a sister?\"\n\nMy sweet, address when you write in future to Mme. Gaston, Poste\nRestante, Versailles. We shall send there every day for letters. I don't\nwant to be known to the country people, and we shall get our provisions\nfrom Paris. In this way I hope we may guard the secret of our lives.\nNobody has been seen in the place during the years spent in preparing\nour retreat; and the purchase was made in the troubled period which\nfollowed the revolution of July. The only person who has shown himself\nhere is the architect; he alone is known, and he will not return.\n\nFarewell. As I write this word, I know not whether my heart is fuller\nof grief or joy. That proves, does it not, that the pain of losing you\nequals my love for Gaston?\n\n\n\n\nXLIX. MARIE GASTON TO DANIEL D'ARTHEZ October 1833.\n\nMy Dear Daniel,--I need two witnesses for my marriage. I beg of you to\ncome to-morrow evening for this purpose, bringing with you our worthy\nand honored friend, Joseph Bridau. She who is to be my wife, with an\ninstinctive divination of my dearest wishes, has declared her intention\nof living far from the world in complete retirement. You, who have done\nso much to lighten my penury, have been left in ignorance of my love;\nbut you will understand that absolute secrecy was essential.\n\nThis will explain to you why it is that, for the last year, we have seen\nso little of each other. On the morrow of my wedding we shall be\nparted for a long time; but, Daniel, you are of stuff to understand me.\nFriendship can subsist in the absence of the friend. There may be times\nwhen I shall want you badly, but I shall not see you, at least not in\nmy own house. Here again _she_ has forestalled our wishes. She has\nsacrificed to me her intimacy with a friend of her childhood, who has\nbeen a sister to her. For her sake, then, I also must relinquish my\ncomrade!\n\nFrom this fact alone you will divine that ours is no mere passing\nfancy, but love, absolute, perfect, godlike; love based upon the fullest\nknowledge that can bind two hearts in sympathy. To me it is a perpetual\nspring of purest delight.\n\nYet nature allows of no happiness without alloy; and deep down, in the\ninnermost recess of my heart, I am conscious of a lurking thought, not\nshared with her, the pang of which is for me alone. You have too often\ncome to the help of my inveterate poverty to be ignorant how desperate\nmatters were with me. Where should I have found courage to keep up the\nstruggle of life, after seeing my hopes so often blighted, but for your\ncheering words, your tactful aid, and the knowledge of what you had come\nthrough? Briefly, then, my friend, she freed me from that crushing load\nof debt, which was no secret to you. She is wealthy, I am penniless.\nMany a time have I exclaimed, in one of my fits of idleness, \"Oh for\nsome great heiress to cast her eye on me!\" And now, in presence of\nthis reality, the boy's careless jest, the unscrupulous cynicism of the\noutcast, have alike vanished, leaving in their place only a bitter sense\nof humiliation, which not the most considerate tenderness on her part,\nnor my own assurance of her noble nature, can remove. Nay, what better\nproof of my love could there exist, for her or for myself, than this\nshame, from which I have not recoiled, even when powerless to overcome\nit? The fact remains that there is a point where, far from protecting, I\nam the protected.\n\nThis is my pain which I confide to you.\n\nExcept in this one particular, dear Daniel, my fondest dreams are more\nthan realized. Fairest and noblest among women, such a bride might\nindeed raise a man to giddy heights of bliss. Her gentle ways are\nseasoned with wit, her love comes with an ever-fresh grace and charm;\nher mind is well informed and quick to understand; in person, she is\nfair and lovely, with a rounded slimness, as though Raphael and Rubens\nhad conspired to create a woman! I do not know whether I could have\nworshiped with such fervor at the shrine of a dark beauty; a brunette\nalways strikes me as an unfinished boy. She is a widow, childless, and\ntwenty-seven years of age. Though brimful of life and energy, she has\nher moods also of dreamy melancholy. These rare gifts go with a proud\naristocratic bearing; she has a fine presence.\n\nShe belongs to one of those old families who make a fetich of rank, yet\nloves me enough to ignore the misfortune of my birth. Our secret passion\nis now of long standing; we have made trial, each of the other, and find\nthat in the matter of jealousy we are twin spirits; our thoughts are the\nreverberation of the same thunderclap. We both love for the first time,\nand this bewitching springtime has filled its days for us with all the\nimages of delight that fancy can paint in laughing, sweet, or musing\nmood. Our path has been strewn with the flowers of tender imaginings.\nEach hour brought its own wealth, and when we parted, it was to put our\nthoughts in verse. Not for a moment did I harbor the idea of sullying\nthe brightness of such a time by giving the rein to sensual passion,\nhowever it might chafe within. She was a widow and free; intuitively,\nshe realized all the homage implied in this constant self-restraint,\nwhich often moved her to tears. Can you not read in this, my friend, a\nsoul of noble temper? In mutual fear we shunned even the first kiss of\nlove.\n\n\"We have each a wrong to reproach ourselves with,\" she said one day.\n\n\"Where is yours?\" I asked.\n\n\"My marriage,\" was her reply.\n\nDaniel, you are a giant among us and you love one of the most gifted\nwomen of the aristocracy, which has produced my Armande; what need to\ntell you more? Such an answer lays bare to you a woman's heart and all\nthe happiness which is in store for your friend, MARIE GASTON.\n\n\n\n\nL. MME. DE L'ESTORADE TO MME. DE MACUMER\n\nLouise, can it be that, with all your knowledge of the deep-seated\nmischief wrought by the indulgence of passion, even within the heart of\nmarriage, you are planning a life of wedded solitude? Having sacrificed\nyour first husband in the course of a fashionable career, would you now\nfly to the desert to consume a second? What stores of misery you are\nlaying up for yourself!\n\nBut I see from the way you have set about it that there is no going\nback. The man who has overcome your aversion to a second marriage must\nindeed possess some magic of mind and heart; and you can only be left\nto your illusions. But have you forgotten your former criticism on young\nmen? Not one, you would say, but has visited haunts of shame, and\nhas besmirched his purity with the filth of the streets. Where is the\nchange, pray--in them or in you?\n\nYou are a lucky woman to be able to believe in happiness. I have not the\ncourage to blame you for it, though the instinct of affection urges me\nto dissuade you from this marriage. Yes, a thousand times, yes, it\nis true that nature and society are at one in making war on absolute\nhappiness, because such a condition is opposed to the laws of both;\npossibly, also, because Heaven is jealous of its privileges. My love\nfor you forebodes some disaster to which all my penetration can give no\ndefinite form. I know neither whence nor from whom it will arise; but\none need be no prophet to foretell that the mere weight of a boundless\nhappiness will overpower you. Excess of joy is harder to bear than any\namount of sorrow.\n\nAgainst him I have not a word to say. You love him, and in all\nprobability I have never seen him; but some idle day I hope you will\nsend me a sketch, however slight, of this rare, fine animal.\n\nIf you see me so resigned and cheerful, it is because I am convinced\nthat, once the honeymoon is over you will both with one accord, fall\nback into the common track. Some day, two years hence, when we are\nwalking along this famous road, you will exclaim, \"Why, there is the\nchalet which was to be my home for ever!\" And you will laugh your dear\nold laugh, which shows all your pretty teeth!\n\nI have said nothing yet to Louis; it would be too good an opening for\nhis ridicule. I shall tell him simply that you are going to be married,\nand that you wish it kept secret. Unluckily, you need neither mother\nnor sister for your bridal evening. We are in October now; like a brave\nwoman, you are grappling with winter first. If it were not a question\nof marriage, I should say you were taking the bull by the horns. In any\ncase, you will have in me the most discreet and intelligent of friends.\nThat mysterious region, known as the centre of Africa, has swallowed\nup many travelers, and you seem to me to be launching on an expedition\nwhich, in the domain of sentiment, corresponds to those where so\nmany explorers have perished, whether in the sands or at the hands of\nnatives. Your desert is, happily, only two leagues from Paris, so I can\nwish you quite cheerfully, \"A safe journey and speedy return.\"\n\n\n\n\nLI. THE COMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE TO MME. MARIE GASTON 1835.\n\nWhat has come to you, my dear? After a silence of two years, surely\nRenee has a right to feel anxious about Louise. So this is love! It\nbrushes aside and scatters to the winds a friendship such as ours! You\nmust admit that, devoted as I am to my children--more even perhaps than\nyou to your Gaston--a mother's love has something expansive about it\nwhich does not allow it to steal from other affections, or interfere\nwith the claims of friendship. I miss your letters, I long for a sight\nof your dear, sweet face. Oh! Louise, my heart has only conjecture to\nfeed upon!\n\nAs regards ourselves, I will try and tell you everything as briefly as\npossible.\n\nOn reading your last letter but one, I find some stinging comments on\nour political situation. You mocked at us for keeping the post in the\nAudit Department, which, as well as the title of Count, Louis owed to\nthe favor of Charles X. But I should like to know, please, how it would\nbe possible out of an income of forty thousand livres, thirty thousand\nof which go with the entail, to give a suitable start in life to\nAthenais and my poor little beggar Rene. Was it not a duty to live on\nour salary and prudently allow the income of the estate to accumulate?\nIn this way we shall, in twenty years, have put together about six\nhundred thousand francs, which will provide portions for my daughter and\nfor Rene, whom I destine for the navy. The poor little chap will have an\nincome of ten thousand livres, and perhaps we may contrive to leave him\nin cash enough to bring his portion up to the amount of his sister's.\n\nWhen he is Captain, my beggar will be able to make a wealthy marriage,\nand take a position in society as good as his elder brother's.\n\nThese considerations of prudence determined the acceptance in our family\nof the new order of things. The new dynasty, as was natural, raised\nLouis to the Peerage and made him a grand officer of the Legion of\nHonor. The oath once taken, l'Estorade could not be half-hearted in his\nservices, and he has since then made himself very useful in the Chamber.\nThe position he has now attained is one in which he can rest upon his\noars till the end of his days. He has a good deal of adroitness in\nbusiness matters; and though he can hardly be called an orator, speaks\npleasantly and fluently, which is all that is necessary in politics.\nHis shrewdness and the extent of his information in all matters of\ngovernment and administration are fully appreciated, and all parties\nconsider him indispensable. I may tell you that he was recently offered\nan embassy, but I would not let him accept it. I am tied to Paris by the\neducation of Armand and Athenais--who are now respectively thirteen and\nnearly eleven--and I don't intend leaving till little Rene has completed\nhis, which is just beginning.\n\nWe could not have remained faithful to the elder branch of the dynasty\nand returned to our country life without allowing the education and\nprospects of the three children to suffer. A mother, my sweet, is hardly\ncalled on to be a Decius, especially at a time when the type is rare. In\nfifteen years from now, l'Estorade will be able to retire to La Crampade\non a good pension, having found a place as referendary for Armand in the\nAudit Department.\n\nAs for Rene, the navy will doubtless make a diplomatist of him.\nThe little rogue, at seven years old, has all the cunning of an old\nCardinal.\n\nOh! Louise, I am indeed a happy mother. My children are an endless\nsource of joy to me.\n\n  Senza brama sicura ricchezza.\n\nArmand is a day scholar at Henry IV.'s school. I made up my mind he\nshould have a public-school training, yet could not reconcile myself to\nthe thought of parting with him; so I compromised, as the Duc d'Orleans\ndid before he became--or in order that he might become--Louis Philippe.\nEvery morning Lucas, the old servant whom you will remember, takes\nArmand to school in time for the first lesson, and brings him home again\nat half-past four. In the house we have a private tutor, an admirable\nscholar, who helps Armand with his work in the evenings, and calls him\nin the morning at the school hour. Lucas takes him some lunch during the\nplay hour at midday. In this way I am with my boy at dinner and until he\ngoes to bed at night, and I see him off in the morning.\n\nArmand is the same charming little fellow, full of feeling and unselfish\nimpulse, whom you loved; and his tutor is quite pleased with him. I\nstill have Nais and the baby--two restless little mortals--but I am\nquite as much a child as they are. I could not bring myself to lose the\ndarlings' sweet caresses. I could not live without the feeling that\nat any moment I can fly to Armand's bedside and watch his slumbers or\nsnatch a kiss.\n\nYet home education is not without its drawbacks, to which I am fully\nalive. Society, like nature, is a jealous power, and will have not her\nrights encroached on, or her system set at naught. Thus, children who\nare brought up at home are exposed too early to the fire of the world;\nthey see its passions and become at home with its subterfuges. The finer\ndistinctions, which regulate the conduct of matured men and women, elude\ntheir perceptions, and they take feeling and passion for their guide\ninstead of subordinating those to the code of society; whilst the gay\ntrappings and tinsel which attract so much of the world's favor blind\nthem to the importance of the more sober virtues. A child of fifteen\nwith the assurance of a man of the world is a thing against all nature;\nat twenty-five he will be prematurely old, and his precocious knowledge\nonly unfits him for the genuine study on which all solid ability must\nrest. Life in society is one long comedy, and those who take part in it,\nlike other actors, reflect back impressions which never penetrate\nbelow the surface. A mother, therefore, who wishes not to part from her\nchildren, must resolutely determine that they shall not enter the gay\nworld; she must have courage to resist their inclinations, as well\nas her own, and keep them in the background. Cornelia had to keep her\njewels under lock and key. Shall I do less for the children who are all\nthe world to me?\n\nNow that I am thirty, the heat of the day is over, the hardest bit of\nthe road lies behind me. In a few years I shall be an old woman, and the\nsense of duty done is an immense encouragement. It would almost seem as\nthough my trio can read my thoughts and shape themselves accordingly. A\nmysterious bond of sympathy unites me to these children who have never\nleft my side. If they knew the blank in my life which they have to fill,\nthey could not be more lavish of the solace they bring.\n\nArmand, who was dull and dreamy during his first three years at school,\nand caused me some uneasiness, has made a sudden start. Doubtless\nhe realized, in a way most children never do, the aim of all this\npreparatory work, which is to sharpen the intelligence, to get them into\nhabits of application and accustom them to that fundamental principle of\nall society--obedience. My dear, a few days ago I had the proud joy of\nseeing Armand crowned at the great interscholastic competition in\nthe crowded Sorbonne, when your godson received the first prize for\ntranslation. At the school distribution he got two first prizes--one for\nverse, and one for an essay. I went quite white when his name was called\nout, and longed to shout aloud, \"I am his mother!\" Little Nais squeezed\nmy hand till it hurt, if at such a moment it were possible to feel pain.\nAh! Louise, a day like this might outweigh many a dream of love!\n\nHis brother's triumphs have spurred on little Rene, who wants to go to\nschool too. Sometimes the three children make such a racket, shouting\nand rushing about the house, that I wonder how my head stands it. I am\nalways with them; no one else, not even Mary, is allowed to take care\nof my children. But the calling of a mother, if taxing, has so many\ncompensating joys! To see a child leave its play and run to hug one, out\nof the fulness of its heart, what could be sweeter?\n\nThen it is only in being constantly with them that one can study their\ncharacters. It is the duty of a mother, and one which she can depute to\nno hired teacher, to decipher the tastes, temper, and natural aptitudes\nof her children from their infancy. All home-bred children are\ndistinguished by ease of manner and tact, two acquired qualities which\nmay go far to supply the lack of natural ability, whereas no natural\nability can atone for the loss of this early training. I have already\nlearned to discriminate this difference of tone in the men whom I meet\nin society, and to trace the hand of a woman in the formation of a\nyoung man's manners. How could any woman defraud her children of such a\npossession? You see what rewards attend the performance of my tasks!\n\nArmand, I feel certain, will make an admirable judge, the most upright\nof public servants, the most devoted of deputies. And where would you\nfind a sailor bolder, more adventurous, more astute than my Rene will be\na few years hence? The little rascal has already an iron will, whatever\nhe wants he manages to get; he will try a thousand circuitous ways to\nreach his end, and if not successful then, will devise a thousand and\nfirst. Where dear Armand quietly resigns himself and tries to get at the\nreason of things, Rene will storm, and strive, and puzzle, chattering\nall the time, till at last he finds some chink in the obstacle; if there\nis room for the blade of a knife to pass, his little carriage will ride\nthrough in triumph.\n\nAnd Nais? Nais is so completely a second self that I can hardly realize\nher as distinct from my own flesh and blood. What a darling she is, and\nhow I love to make a little lady of her, to dress her curly hair, tender\nthoughts mingling the while with every touch! I must have her happy; I\nshall only give her to the man who loves her and whom she loves.\nBut, Heavens! when I let her put on her little ornaments, or pass a\ncherry-colored ribbon through her hair, or fasten the shoes on her tiny\nfeet, a sickening thought comes over me. How can one order the destiny\nof a girl? Who can say that she will not love a scoundrel or some man\nwho is indifferent to her? Tears often spring to my eyes as I watch her.\nThis lovely creature, this flower, this rosebud which has blossomed in\none's heart, to be handed over to a man who will tear it from the stem\nand leave it bare! Louise, it is you--you, who in two years have not\nwritten three words to tell me of your welfare--it is you who have\nrecalled to my mind the terrible possibilities of marriage, so full of\nanguish for a mother wrapped up, as I am, in her child. Farewell now,\nfor in truth you don't deserve my friendship, and I hardly know how to\nwrite. Oh! answer me, dear Louise.\n\n\n\n\nLII. MME. GASTON TO MME. DE L'ESTORADE The Chalet.\n\nSo, after a silence of two years, you are pricked by curiosity, and want\nto know why I have not written. My dear Renee, there are no words, no\nimages, no language to express my happiness. That we have strength to\nbear it sums up all I could say. It costs us no effort, for we are in\nperfect sympathy. The whole two years have known no note of discord in\nthe harmony, no jarring word in the interchange of feeling, no shade of\ndifference in our lightest wish. Not one in this long succession of\ndays has failed to bear its own peculiar fruit; not a moment has passed\nwithout being enriched by the play of fancy. So far are we from dreading\nthe canker of monotony in our life, that our only fear is lest it should\nnot be long enough to contain all the poetic creations of a love as rich\nand varied in its development as Nature herself. Of disappointment not\na trace! We find more pleasure in being together than on the first day,\nand each hour as it goes by discloses fresh reason for our love. Every\nday as we take our evening stroll after dinner, we tell each other that\nwe really must go and see what is doing in Paris, just as one might talk\nof going to Switzerland.\n\n\"Only think,\" Gaston will exclaim, \"such and such a boulevard is\nbeing made, the Madeleine is finished. We ought to see it. Let us go\nto-morrow.\"\n\nAnd to-morrow comes, and we are in no hurry to get up, and we breakfast\nin our bedroom. Then midday is on us, and it is too hot; a siesta seems\nappropriate. Then Gaston wishes to look at me, and he gazes on my face\nas though it were a picture, losing himself in this contemplation,\nwhich, as you may suppose, is not one-sided. Tears rise to the eyes\nof both as we think of our love and tremble. I am still the mistress,\npretending, that is, to give less than I receive, and I revel in this\ndeception. To a woman what can be sweeter than to see passion ever held\nin check by tenderness, and the man who is her master stayed, like a\ntimid suitor, by a word from her, within the limits that she chooses?\n\nYou asked me to describe him; but, Renee, it is not possible to make\na portrait of the man we love. How could the heart be kept out of the\nwork? Besides, to be frank between ourselves, we may admit that one of\nthe dire effects of civilization on our manners is to make of man in\nsociety a being so utterly different from the natural man of strong\nfeeling, that sometimes not a single point of likeness can be found\nbetween these two aspects of the same person. The man who falls into the\nmost graceful operatic poses, as he pours sweet nothings into your ear\nby the fire at night, may be entirely destitute of those more intimate\ncharms which a woman values. On the other hand, an ugly, boorish,\nbadly-dressed figure may mark a man endowed with the very genius of\nlove, and who has a perfect mastery over situations which might baffle\nus with our superficial graces. A man whose conventional aspect accords\nwith his real nature, who, in the intimacy of wedded love, possesses\nthat inborn grace which can be neither given nor acquired, but which\nGreek art has embodied in statuary, that careless innocence of the\nancient poets which, even in frank undress, seems to clothe the soul as\nwith a veil of modesty--this is our ideal, born of our own conceptions,\nand linked with the universal harmony which seems to be the reality\nunderlying all created things. To find this ideal in life is the problem\nwhich haunts the imagination of every woman--in Gaston I have found it.\n\nAh! dear, I did not know what love could be, united to youth, talent,\nand beauty. Gaston has no affectations, he moves with an instinctive and\nunstudied grace. When we walk alone together in the woods, his arm round\nmy waist, mine resting on his shoulder, body fitting to body, and head\ntouching head, our step is so even, uniform, and gentle, that those who\nsee us pass by night take the vision for a single figure gliding over\nthe graveled walks, like one of Homer's immortals. A like harmony exists\nin our desires, our thoughts, our words. More than once on some evening\nwhen a passing shower has left the leaves glistening and the moist grass\nbright with a more vivid green, it has chanced that we ended our walk\nwithout uttering a word, as we listened to the patter of falling drops\nand feasted our eyes on the scarlet sunset, flaring on the hilltops or\ndyeing with a warmer tone the gray of the tree trunks.\n\nBeyond a doubt our thoughts then rose to Heaven in silent prayer,\npleading as it were, for our happiness. At times a cry would escape\nus at the moment when some sudden bend on the path opened up fresh\nbeauties. What words can tell how honey-sweet, how full of meaning, is\na kiss half-timidly exchanged within the sanctuary of nature--it is as\nthough God had created us to worship in this fashion.\n\nAnd we return home, each more deeply in love than ever.\n\nA love so passionate between old married people would be an outrage on\nsociety in Paris; only in the heart of the woods, like lovers, can we\ngive scope to it.\n\nTo come to particulars, Gaston is of middle height--the height proper\nto all men of purpose. Neither stout nor thin, his figure is admirably\nmade, with ample fulness in the proportions, while every motion is\nagile; he leaps a ditch with the easy grace of a wild animal. Whatever\nhis attitude, he seems to have an instinctive sense of balance, and this\nis very rare in men who are given to thought. Though a dark man, he has\nan extraordinarily fair complexion; his jet-black hair contrasts finely\nwith the lustreless tints of the neck and forehead. He has the tragic\nhead of Louis XIII. His moustache and tuft have been allowed to grow,\nbut I made him shave the whiskers and beard, which were getting too\ncommon. An honorable poverty has been his safeguard, and handed him over\nto me, unsoiled by the loose life which ruins so many young men. His\nteeth are magnificent, and he has a constitution of iron. His keen\nblue eyes, for me full of tenderness, will flash like lightning at any\nrousing thought.\n\nLike all men of strong character and powerful mind, he has an admirable\ntemper; its evenness would surprise you, as it did me. I have listened\nto the tale of many a woman's home troubles; I have heard of the moods\nand depression of men dissatisfied with themselves, who either won't get\nold or age ungracefully, men who carry about through life the rankling\nmemory of some youthful excess, whose veins run poison and whose eyes\nare never frankly happy, men who cloak suspicion under bad temper, and\nmake their women pay for an hour's peace by a morning of annoyance, who\ntake vengeance on us for a beauty which is hateful to them because they\nhave ceased themselves to be attractive,--all these are horrors unknown\nto youth. They are the penalty of unequal unions. Oh! my dear, whatever\nyou do, don't marry Athenais to an old man!\n\nBut his smile--how I feast on it! A smile which is always there, yet\nalways fresh through the play of subtle fancy, a speaking smile which\nmakes of the lips a storehouse for thoughts of love and unspoken\ngratitude, a smile which links present joys to past. For nothing is\nallowed to drop out of our common life. The smallest works of nature\nhave become part and parcel of our joy. In these delightful woods\neverything is alive and eloquent of ourselves. An old moss-grown oak,\nnear the woodsman's house on the roadside, reminds us how we sat there,\nwearied, under its shade, while Gaston taught me about the mosses at our\nfeet and told me their story, till, gradually ascending from science to\nscience, we touched the very confines of creation.\n\nThere is something so kindred in our minds that they seem to me like\ntwo editions of the same book. You see what a literary tendency I have\ndeveloped! We both have the habit, or the gift, of looking at every\nsubject broadly, of taking in all its points of view, and the proof we\nare constantly giving ourselves of the singleness of our inward vision\nis an ever-new pleasure. We have actually come to look on this community\nof mind as a pledge of love; and if it ever failed us, it would mean as\nmuch to us as would a breach of fidelity in an ordinary home.\n\nMy life, full as it is of pleasures, would seem to you, nevertheless,\nextremely laborious. To begin with, my dear, you must know that\nLouise-Armande-Marie de Chaulieu does her own room. I could not bear\nthat a hired menial, some woman or girl from the outside, should become\ninitiated--literary touch again!--into the secrets of my bedroom. The\nveriest trifles connected with the worship of my heart partake of its\nsacred character. This is not jealousy; it is self-respect. Thus my\nroom is done out with all the care a young girl in love bestows on her\nperson, and with the precision of an old maid. My dressing-room is no\nchaos of litter; on the contrary, it makes a charming boudoir. My keen\neye has foreseen all contingencies. At whatever hour the lord and master\nenters, he will find nothing to distress, surprise, or shock him; he is\ngreeted by flowers, scents, and everything that can please the eye.\n\nI get up in the early dawn, while he is still sleeping, and, without\ndisturbing him, pass into the dressing-room, where, profiting by my\nmother's experience, I remove the traces of sleep by bathing in cold\nwater. For during sleep the skin, being less active, does not perform\nits functions adequately; it becomes warm and covered with a sort\nof mist or atmosphere of sticky matter, visible to the eye. From a\nsponge-bath a woman issues ten years younger, and this, perhaps, is the\ninterpretation of the myth of Venus rising from the sea. So the cold\nwater restores to me the saucy charm of dawn, and, having combed\nand scented my hair and made a most fastidious toilet, I glide back,\nsnake-like, in order that my master may find me, dainty as a spring\nmorning, at his wakening. He is charmed with this freshness, as of a\nnewly-opened flower, without having the least idea how it is produced.\n\nThe regular toilet of the day is a matter for my maid, and this takes\nplace later in a larger room, set aside for the purpose. As you may\nsuppose, there is also a toilet for going to bed. Three times a day, you\nsee, or it may be four, do I array myself for the delight of my husband;\nwhich, again, dear one, is suggestive of certain ancient myths.\n\nBut our work is not all play. We take a great deal of interest in our\nflowers, in the beauties of the hothouse, and in our trees. We give\nourselves in all seriousness to horticulture, and embosom the chalet in\nflowers, of which we are passionately fond. Our lawns are always green,\nour shrubberies as well tended as those of a millionaire. And nothing\nI assure you, can match the beauty of our walled garden. We are regular\ngluttons over our fruit, and watch with tender interest our Montreuil\npeaches, our hotbeds, our laden trellises, and pyramidal pear-trees.\n\nBut lest these rural pursuits should fail to satisfy my beloved's mind,\nI have advised him to finish, in the quiet of this retreat, some plays\nwhich were begun in his starvation days, and which are really very fine.\nThis is the only kind of literary work which can be done in odd moments,\nfor it requires long intervals of reflection, and does not demand\nthe elaborate pruning essential to a finished style. One can't make a\ntask-work of dialogue; there must be biting touches, summings-up, and\nflashes of wit, which are the blossoms of the mind, and come rather by\ninspiration than reflection. This sort of intellectual sport is very\nmuch in my line. I assist Gaston in his work, and in this way manage to\naccompany him even in the boldest flights of his imagination. Do you see\nnow how it is that my winter evenings never drag?\n\nOur servants have such an easy time, that never once since we were\nmarried have we had to reprimand any of them. When questioned about us,\nthey have had wit enough to draw on their imaginations, and have given\nus out as the companion and secretary of a lady and gentleman supposed\nto be traveling. They never go out without asking permission, which they\nknow will not be refused; they are contented too, and see plainly that\nit will be their own fault if there is a change for the worse. The\ngardeners are allowed to sell the surplus of our fruits and vegetables.\nThe dairymaid does the same with the milk, the cream, and the fresh\nbutter, on condition that the best of the produce is reserved for us.\nThey are well pleased with their profits, and we are delighted with an\nabundance which no money and no ingenuity can procure in that terrible\nParis, where it costs a hundred francs to produce a single fine peach.\n\nAll this is not without its meaning, my dear. I wish to fill the place\nof society to my husband; now society is amusing, and therefore his\nsolitude must not be allowed to pall on him. I believed myself jealous\nin the old days, when I merely allowed myself to be loved; now I know\nreal jealousy, the jealousy of the lover. A single indifferent glance\nunnerves me. From time to time I say to myself, \"Suppose he ceased to\nlove me!\" And a shudder goes through me. I tremble before him, as the\nChristian before his God.\n\nAlas! Renee, I am still without a child. The time will surely come--it\nmust come--when our hermitage will need a father's and a mother's care\nto brighten it, when we shall both pine to see the little frocks and\npelisses, the brown or golden heads, leaping, running through our\nshrubberies and flowery paths. Oh! it is a cruel jest of Nature's, a\nflowering tree that bears no fruit. The thought of your lovely children\ngoes through me like a knife. My life has grown narrower, while yours\nhas expanded and shed its rays afar. The passion of love is essentially\nselfish, while motherhood widens the circle of our feelings. How well\nI felt this difference when I read your kind, tender letter! To see you\nthus living in three hearts roused my envy. Yes, you are happy; you have\nhad wisdom to obey the laws of social life, whilst I stand outside, an\nalien.\n\nChildren, dear and loving children, can alone console a woman for the\nloss of her beauty. I shall soon be thirty, and at that age the dirge\nwithin begins. What though I am still beautiful, the limits of my\nwoman's reign are none the less in sight. When they are reached, what\nthen? I shall be forty before he is; I shall be old while he is still\nyoung. When this thought goes to my heart, I lie at his feet for an hour\nat a time, making him swear to tell me instantly if ever he feels his\nlove diminishing.\n\nBut he is a child. He swears, as though the mere suggestion were an\nabsurdity, and he is so beautiful that--Renee, you understand--I believe\nhim.\n\nGood-bye, sweet one. Shall we ever again let years pass without writing?\nHappiness is a monotonous theme, and that is, perhaps, the reason why,\nto souls who love, Dante appears even greater in the _Paradiso_ than in\nthe _Inferno_. I am not Dante; I am only your friend, and I don't\nwant to bore you. You can write, for in your children you have an\never-growing, every-varying source of happiness, while mine... No more\nof this. A thousand loves.\n\n\n\n\nLIII. MME. DE L'ESTORADE TO MME. GASTON\n\nMy dear Louise,--I have read and re-read your letter, and the more\ndeeply I enter into its spirit, the clearer does it become to me that\nit is the letter, not of a woman, but of a child. You are the same old\nLouise, and you forget, what I used to repeat over and over again to\nyou, that the passion of love belongs rightly to a state of nature, and\nhas only been purloined by civilization. So fleeting is its character,\nthat the resources of society are powerless to modify its primitive\ncondition, and it becomes the effort of all noble minds to make a man\nof the infant Cupid. But, as you yourself admit, such love ceases to be\nnatural.\n\nSociety, my dear abhors sterility; but substituting a lasting sentiment\nfor the mere passing frenzy of nature, it has succeeded in creating\nthat greatest of all human inventions--the family, which is the enduring\nbasis of all organized society. To the accomplishment of this end, it\nhas sacrificed the individual, man as well as woman; for we must not\nshut our eyes to the fact that a married man devotes his energy, his\npower, and all his possession to his wife. Is it not she who reaps the\nbenefit of all his care? For whom, if not for her, are the luxury and\nwealth, the position and distinction, the comfort and the gaiety of the\nhome?\n\nOh! my sweet, once again you have taken the wrong turning in life. To be\nadored is a young girl's dream, which may survive a few springtimes; it\ncannot be that of the mature woman, the wife and mother. To a woman's\nvanity it is, perhaps, enough to know that she can command adoration if\nshe likes. If you would live the life of a wife and mother, return, I\nbeg of you, to Paris. Let me repeat my warning: It is not misfortune\nwhich you have to dread, as others do--it is happiness.\n\nListen to me, my child! It is the simple things of life--bread, air,\nsilence--of which we do not tire; they have no piquancy which can create\ndistaste; it is highly-flavored dishes which irritate the palate, and in\nthe end exhaust it. Were it possible that I should to-day be loved by\na man for whom I could conceive a passion, such as yours for Gaston, I\nwould still cling to the duties and the children, who are so dear to\nme. To a woman's heart the feelings of a mother are among the simple,\nnatural, fruitful, and inexhaustible things of life. I can recall\nthe day, now nearly fourteen years ago, when I embarked on a life of\nself-sacrifice with the despair of a shipwrecked mariner clinging to the\nmast of his vessel; now, as I invoke the memory of past years, I feel\nthat I would make the same choice again. No other guiding principle\nis so safe, or leads to such rich reward. The spectacle of your life,\nwhich, for all the romance and poetry with which you invest it, still\nremains based on nothing but a ruthless selfishness, has helped to\nstrengthen my convictions. This is the last time I shall speak to you in\nthis way; but I could not refrain from once more pleading with you when\nI found that your happiness had been proof against the most searching of\nall trials.\n\nAnd one more point I must urge on you, suggested by my meditations on\nyour retirement. Life, whether of the body or the heart, consists in\ncertain balanced movements. Any excess introduced into the working of\nthis routine gives rise either to pain or to pleasure, both of which are\na mere fever of the soul, bound to be fugitive because nature is not\nso framed as to support it long. But to make of life one long excess is\nsurely to choose sickness for one's portion. You are sick because you\nmaintain at the temperature of passion a feeling which marriage ought to\nconvert into a steadying, purifying influence.\n\nYes, my sweet, I see it clearly now; the glory of a home consists in\nthis very calm, this intimacy, this sharing alike of good and evil,\nwhich the vulgar ridicule. How noble was the reply of the Duchesse de\nSully, the wife of the great Sully, to some one who remarked that her\nhusband, for all his grave exterior, did not scruple to keep a mistress.\n\"What of that?\" she said. \"I represent the honor of the house, and\nshould decline to play the part of a courtesan there.\"\n\nBut you, Louise, who are naturally more passionate than tender, would\nbe at once the wife and the mistress. With the soul of a Heloise and the\npassions of a Saint Theresa, you slip the leash on all your impulses, so\nlong as they are sanctioned by law; in a word, you degrade the marriage\nrite. Surely the tables are turned. The reproaches you once heaped on me\nfor immorally, as you said, seizing the means of happiness from the\nvery outset of my wedded life, might be directed against yourself for\ngrasping at everything which may serve your passion. What! must nature\nand society alike be in bondage to your caprice? You are the old Louise;\nyou have never acquired the qualities which ought to be a woman's;\nself-willed and unreasonable as a girl, you introduce withal into your\nlove the keenest and most mercenary of calculations! Are you sure that,\nafter all, the price you ask for your toilets is not too high? All these\nprecautions are to my mind very suggestive of mistrust.\n\nOh, dear Louise, if only you knew the sweetness of a mother's efforts\nto discipline herself in kindness and gentleness to all about her! My\nproud, self-sufficing temper gradually dissolved into a soft melancholy,\nwhich in turn has been swallowed up by those delights of motherhood\nwhich have been its reward. If the early hours were toilsome, the\nevening will be tranquil and clear. My dread is lest the day of your\nlife should take the opposite course.\n\nWhen I had read your letter to a close, I prayed God to send you among\nus for a day, that you might see what family life really is, and learn\nthe nature of those joys, which are lasting and sweeter than tongue can\ntell, because they are genuine, simple, and natural. But, alas! what\nchance have I with the best of arguments against a fallacy which makes\nyou happy? As I write these words, my eyes fill with tears. I had felt\nso sure that some months of honeymoon would prove a surfeit and restore\nyou to reason. But I see that there is no limit to your appetite, and\nthat, having killed a man who loved you, you will not cease till you\nhave killed love itself. Farewell, dear misguided friend. I am in\ndespair that the letter which I hoped might reconcile you to society by\nits picture of my happiness should have brought forth only a paean of\nselfishness. Yes, your love is selfish; you love Gaston far less for\nhimself than for what he is to you.\n\n\n\n\nLIV. MME. GASTON TO THE COMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE May 20th.\n\nRenee, calamity has come--no, that is no word for it--it has burst like\na thunderbolt over your poor Louise. You know what that means; calamity\nfor me is doubt; certainty would be death.\n\nThe day before yesterday, when I had finished my first toilet, I looked\neverywhere for Gaston to take a little turn with me before lunch, but\nin vain. I went to the stable, and there I saw his mare all in a lather,\nwhile the groom was removing the foam with a knife before rubbing her\ndown.\n\n\"Who in the world has put Fedelta in such a state?\" I asked.\n\n\"Master,\" replied the lad.\n\nI saw the mud of Paris on the mare's legs, for country mud is quite\ndifferent; and at once it flashed through me, \"He has been to Paris.\"\n\nThis thought raised a swarm of others in my heart, and it seemed as\nthough all the life in my body rushed there. To go to Paris without\ntelling me, at the hour when I leave him alone, to hasten there and back\nat such speed as to distress Fedelta. Suspicion clutched me in its iron\ngrip, till I could hardly breathe. I walked aside a few steps to a seat,\nwhere I tried to recover my self-command.\n\nHere Gaston found me, apparently pale and fluttered, for he immediately\nexclaimed, \"What is wrong?\" in a tone of such alarm, that I rose and\ntook his arm. But my muscles refused to move, and I was forced to sit\ndown again. Then he took me in his arms and carried me to the parlor\nclose by, where the frightened servants pressed after us, till Gaston\nmotioned them away. Once left to ourselves, I refused to speak, but was\nable to reach my room, where I shut myself in, to weep my fill. Gaston\nremained something like two hours at my door, listening to my sobs\nand questioning with angelic patience his poor darling, who made no\nresponse.\n\nAt last I told him that I would see him when my eyes were less red and\nmy voice was steady again.\n\nMy formal words drove him from the house. But by the time I had bathed\nmy eyes in iced water and cooled my face, I found him in our room, the\ndoor into which was open, though I had heard no steps. He begged me to\ntell him what was wrong.\n\n\"Nothing,\" I said; \"I saw the mud of Paris on Fedelta's trembling legs;\nit seemed strange that you should go there without telling me; but, of\ncourse, you are free.\"\n\n\"I shall punish you for such wicked thoughts by not giving any\nexplanation till to-morrow,\" he replied.\n\n\"Look at me,\" I said.\n\nMy eyes met his; deep answered to deep. No, not a trace of the cloud of\ndisloyalty which, rising from the soul, must dim the clearness of the\neye. I feigned satisfaction, though really unconvinced. It is not women\nonly who can lie and dissemble!\n\nThe whole of the day we spent together. Ever and again, as I looked\nat him, I realized how fast my heart-strings were bound to him. How\nI trembled and fluttered within when, after a moment's absence, he\nreappeared. I live in him, not in myself. My cruel sufferings gave the\nlie to your unkind letter. Did I ever feel my life thus bound up in the\nnoble Spaniard, who adored me, as I adore this heartless boy? I hate\nthat mare! Fool that I was to keep horses! But the next thing would have\nbeen to lame Gaston or imprison him in the cottage. Wild thoughts like\nthese filled my brain; you see how near I was to madness! If love be\nnot the cage, what power on earth can hold back the man who wants to be\nfree?\n\nI asked him point-blank, \"Do I bore you?\"\n\n\"What needless torture you give yourself!\" was his reply, while he\nlooked at me with tender, pitying eyes. \"Never have I loved you so\ndeeply.\"\n\n\"If that is true, my beloved, let me sell Fedelta,\" I answered.\n\n\"Sell her, by all means!\"\n\nThe reply crushed me. Was it not a covert taunt at my wealth and his\nown nothingness in the house? This may never have occurred to him, but\nI thought it had, and once more I left him. It was night, and I would go\nto bed.\n\nOh! Renee, to be alone with a harrowing thought drives one to thoughts\nof death. These charming gardens, the starry night, the cool air, laden\nwith incense from our wealth of flowers, our valley, our hills--all\nseemed to me gloomy, black, and desolate. It was as though I lay at the\nfoot of a precipice, surrounded by serpents and poisonous plants, and\nsaw no God in the sky. Such a night ages a woman.\n\nNext morning I said:\n\n\"Take Fedelta and be off to Paris! Don't sell her; I love her. Does she\nnot carry you?\"\n\nBut he was not deceived; my tone betrayed the storm of feeling which I\nstrove to conceal.\n\n\"Trust me!\" he replied; and the gesture with which he held out his hand,\nthe glance of his eye, were so full of loyalty that I was overcome.\n\n\"What petty creatures women are!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"No, you love me, that is all,\" he said, pressing me to his heart.\n\n\"Go to Paris without me,\" I said, and this time I made him understand\nthat my suspicions were laid aside.\n\nHe went; I thought he would have stayed. I won't attempt to tell you\nwhat I suffered. I found a second self within, quite strange to me. A\ncrisis like this has, for the woman who loves, a tragic solemnity that\nbaffles words; the whole of life rises before you then, and you search\nin vain for any horizon to it; the veriest trifle is big with meaning, a\nglance contains a volume, icicles drift on uttered words, and the death\nsentence is read in a movement of the lips.\n\nI thought he would have paid me back in kind; had I not been\nmagnanimous? I climbed to the top of the chalet, and my eyes followed\nhim on the road. Ah! my dear Renee, he vanished from my sight with an\nappalling swiftness.\n\n\"How keen he is to go!\" was the thought that sprang of itself.\n\nOnce more alone, I fell back into the hell of possibilities, the\nmaelstrom of mistrust. There were moments when I would have welcomed\nany certainty, even the worst, as a relief from the torture of suspense.\nSuspense is a duel carried on in the heart, and we give no quarter to\nourselves.\n\nI paced up and down the walks. I returned to the house, only to tear\nout again, like a mad woman. Gaston, who left at seven o'clock, did not\nreturn till eleven. Now, as it only takes half an hour to reach Paris\nthrough the park of St. Cloud and the Bois de Boulogne, it is plain that\nhe must have spent three hours in town. He came back radiant, with a\nwhip in his hand for me, an india-rubber whip with a gold handle.\n\nFor a fortnight I had been without a whip, my old one being worn and\nbroken.\n\n\"Was it for this you tortured me?\" I said, as I admired the workmanship\nof this beautiful ornament, which contains a little scent-box at one\nend.\n\nThen it flashed on me that the present was a fresh artifice.\nNevertheless I threw myself at once on his neck, not without reproaching\nhim gently for having caused me so much pain for the sake of a trifle.\nHe was greatly pleased with his ingenuity; his eyes and his whole\nbearing plainly showed the restrained triumph of the successful plotter;\nfor there is a radiance of the soul which is reflected in every feature\nand turn of the body. While still examining the beauties of this work of\nart, I asked him at a moment when we happened to be looking each other\nin the face:\n\n\"Who is the artist?\"\n\n\"A friend of mine.\"\n\n\"Ah! I see it has been mounted by Verdier,\" and I read the name of the\nshop printed on the handle.\n\nGaston is nothing but a child yet. He blushed, and I made much of him\nas a reward for the shame he felt in deceiving me. I pretended to notice\nnothing, and he may well have thought the incident was over.\n\nMay 25th.\n\nThe next morning I was in my riding-habit by six o'clock, and by seven\nlanded at Verdier's, where several whips of the same pattern were shown\nto me. One of the men serving recognized mine when I pointed it out to\nhim.\n\n\"We sold that yesterday to a young gentleman,\" he said. And from the\ndescription I gave him of my traitor Gaston, not a doubt was left of his\nidentity. I will spare you the palpitations which rent my heart during\nthat journey to Paris and the little scene there, which marked the\nturning-point of my life.\n\nBy half-seven I was home again, and Gaston found me, fresh and blooming,\nin my morning dress, sauntering about with a make-believe nonchalance. I\nfelt confident that old Philippe, who had been taken into my confidence,\nwould not have betrayed my absence.\n\n\"Gaston,\" I said, as we walked by the side of the lake, \"you cannot\nblind me to the difference between a work of art inspired by friendship\nand something which has been cast in a mould.\"\n\nHe turned white, and fixed his eyes on me rather than on the damaging\npiece of evidence I thrust before them.\n\n\"My dear,\" I went on, \"this is not a whip; it is a screen behind which\nyou are hiding something from me.\"\n\nThereupon I gave myself the gratification of watching his hopeless\nentanglement in the coverts and labyrinths of deceit and the desperate\nefforts he made to find some wall he might scale and thus escape. In\nvain; he had perforce to remain upon the field, face to face with an\nadversary, who at last laid down her arms in a feigned complacence. But\nit was too late. The fatal mistake, against which my mother had tried to\nwarm me, was made. My jealousy, exposed in all its nakedness, had led\nto war and all its stratagems between Gaston and myself. Jealousy, dear,\nhas neither sense nor decency.\n\nI made up my mind now to suffer in silence, but to keep my eyes open,\nuntil my doubts were resolved one way or another. Then I would either\nbreak with Gaston or bow to my misfortune: no middle course is possible\nfor a woman who respects herself.\n\nWhat can he be concealing? For a secret there is, and the secret has\nto do with a woman. Is it some youthful escapade for which he still\nblushes? But if so, what? The word _what_ is written in letters of\nfire on all I see. I read it in the glassy water of my lake, in the\nshrubbery, in the clouds, on the ceilings, at table, in the flowers of\nthe carpets. A voice cries to me _what?_ in my sleep. Dating from the\nmorning of my discovery, a cruel interest has sprung into our lives, and\nI have become familiar with the bitterest thought that can corrode the\nheart--the thought of treachery in him one loves. Oh! my dear, there is\nheaven and hell together in such a life. Never had I felt this scorching\nflame, I to whom love had appeared only in the form of devoutest\nworship.\n\n\"So you wished to know the gloomy torture-chamber of pain!\" I said to\nmyself. Good, the spirits of evil have heard your prayer; go on your\nroad, unhappy wretch!\n\nMay 30th.\n\nSince that fatal day Gaston no longer works with the careless ease of\nthe wealthy artist, whose work is merely pastime; he sets himself tasks\nlike a professional writer. Four hours a day he devotes to finishing his\ntwo plays.\n\n\"He wants money!\"\n\nA voice within whispered the thought. But why? He spends next to\nnothing; we have absolutely no secrets from each other; there is not a\ncorner of his study which my eyes and my fingers may not explore. His\nyearly expenditure does not amount to two thousand francs, and I know\nthat he has thirty thousand, I can hardly say laid by, but scattered\nloose in a drawer. You can guess what is coming. At midnight, while he\nwas sleeping, I went to see if the money was still there. An icy shiver\nran through me. The drawer was empty.\n\nThat same week I discovered that he went to Sevres to fetch his letters,\nand these letters he must tear up immediately; for though I am a very\nFigaro in contrivances, I have never yet seen a trace of one. Alas! my\nsweet, despite the fine promises and vows by which I bound myself after\nthe scene of the whip, an impulse, which I can only call madness, drove\nme to follow him in one of his rapid rides to the post-office. Gaston\nwas appalled to be thus discovered on horseback, paying the postage of a\nletter which he held in his hand. He looked fixedly at me, and then put\nspurs to Fedelta. The pace was so hard that I felt shaken to bits when I\nreached the lodge gate, though my mental agony was such at the time that\nit might well have dulled all consciousness of bodily pain. Arrived at\nthe gate, Gaston said nothing; he rang the bell and waited without a\nword. I was more dead than alive. I might be mistaken or I might not,\nbut in neither case was it fitting for Armande-Louise-Marie de Chaulieu\nto play the spy. I had sunk to the level of the gutter, by the side of\ncourtesans, opera-dancers, mere creatures of instinct; even the vulgar\nshop-girl or humble seamstress might look down on me.\n\nWhat a moment! At last the door opened; he handed his horse to the\ngroom, and I also dismounted, but into his arms, which were stretched\nout to receive me. I threw my skirt over my left arm, gave him my right,\nand we walked on--still in silence. The few steps we thus took might\nbe reckoned to me for a hundred years of purgatory. A swarm of thoughts\nbeset me as I walked, now seeming to take visible form in tongues of\nfire before my eyes, now assailing my mind, each with its own poisoned\ndart. When the groom and the horses were far away, I stopped Gaston,\nand, looking him in the face, said, as I pointed, with a gesture that\nyou should have seen, to the fatal letter still in his right hand:\n\n\"May I read it?\"\n\nHe gave it to me. I opened it and found a letter from Nathan, the\ndramatic author, informing Gaston that a play of his had been accepted,\nlearned, rehearsed, and would be produced the following Saturday. He\nalso enclosed a box ticket.\n\nThough for me this was the opening of heaven's gates to the martyr, yet\nthe fiend would not leave me in peace, but kept crying, \"Where are the\nthirty thousand francs?\" It was a question which self-respect, dignity,\nall my old self in fact, prevented me from uttering. If my thought\nbecame speech, I might as well throw myself into the lake at once, and\nyet I could hardly keep the words down. Dear friend, was not this a\ntrial passing the strength of woman?\n\nI returned the letter, saying:\n\n\"My poor Gaston, you are getting bored down here. Let us go back to\nParis, won't you?\"\n\n\"To Paris?\" he said. \"But why? I only wanted to find out if I had any\ngift, to taste the flowing bowl of success!\"\n\nNothing would be easier than for me to ransack the drawer sometime while\nhe is working and pretend great surprise at finding the money gone.\nBut that would be going half-way to meet the answer, \"Oh! my friend\nSo-and-So was hard up!\" etc., which a man of Gaston's quick wit would\nnot have far to seek.\n\nThe moral, my dear, is that the brilliant success of this play, which\nall Paris is crowding to see, is due to us, though the whole credit goes\nto Nathan. I am represented by one of the two stars in the legend: Et M\n* *. I saw the first night from the depths of one of the stage boxes.\n\nJuly 1st.\n\nGaston's work and his visits to Paris shall continue. He is preparing\nnew plays, partly because he wants a pretext for going to Paris, partly\nin order to make money. Three plays have been accepted, and two more are\ncommissioned.\n\nOh! my dear, I am lost, all is darkness around me. I would set fire to\nthe house in a moment if that would bring light. What does it all mean?\nIs he ashamed of taking money from me? He is too high-minded for so\ntrumpery a matter to weigh with him. Besides, scruples of the kind could\nonly be the outcome of some love affair. A man would take anything from\nhis wife, but from the woman he has ceased to care for, or is thinking\nof deserting, it is different. If he needs such large sums, it must be\nto spend them on a woman. For himself, why should he hesitate to draw\nfrom my purse? Our savings amount to one hundred thousand francs!\n\nIn short, my sweetheart, I have explored a whole continent of\npossibilities, and after carefully weighing all the evidence, am\nconvinced I have a rival. I am deserted--for whom? At all costs I must\nsee the unknown.\n\nJuly 10th.\n\nLight has come, and it is all over with me. Yes, Renee, at the age of\nthirty, in the perfection of my beauty, with all the resources of\na ready wit and the seductive charms of dress at my command, I am\nbetrayed--and for whom? A large-boned Englishwoman, with big feet and\nthick waist--a regular British cow! There is no longer room for doubt. I\nwill tell you the history of the last few days.\n\nWorn out with suspicions, which were fed by Gaston's guilty silence\n(for, if he had helped a friend, why keep it a secret from me?), his\ninsatiable desire for money, and his frequent journeys to Paris; jealous\ntoo of the work from which he seemed unable to tear himself, I at last\nmade up my mind to take certain steps, of such a degrading nature that\nI cannot tell you about them. Suffice it to say that three days ago I\nascertained that Gaston, when in Paris, visits a house in the Rue de\nla Ville l'Eveque, where he guards his mistress with jealous mystery,\nunexampled in Paris. The porter was surly, and I could get little out of\nhim, but that little was enough to put an end to any lingering hope, and\nwith hope to life. On this point my mind was resolved, and I only waited\nto learn the whole truth first.\n\nWith this object I went to Paris and took rooms in a house exactly\nopposite the one which Gaston visits. Thence I saw him with my own eyes\nenter the courtyard on horseback. Too soon a ghastly fact forced itself\non me. This Englishwoman, who seems to me about thirty-six, is known as\nMme. Gaston. This discovery was my deathblow.\n\nI saw him next walking to the Tuileries with a couple of children. Oh!\nmy dear, two children, the living images of Gaston! The likeness is\nso strong that it bears scandal on the face of it. And what pretty\nchildren! in their handsome English costumes! She is the mother of his\nchildren. Here is the key to the whole mystery.\n\nThe woman herself might be a Greek statue, stepped down from some\nmonument. Cold and white as marble, she moves sedately with a mother's\npride. She is undeniably beautiful but heavy as a man-of-war. There\nis no breeding or distinction about her; nothing of the English lady.\nProbably she is a farmer's daughter from some wretched and remote\ncountry village, or, it may be, the eleventh child of some poor\nclergyman!\n\nI reached home, after a miserable journey, during which all sorts of\nfiendish thoughts had me at their mercy, with hardly any life left in\nme. Was she married? Did he know her before our marriage? Had she been\ndeserted by some rich man, whose mistress she was, and thus thrown back\nupon Gaston's hands? Conjectures without end flitted through my brain,\nas though conjecture were needed in the presence of the children.\n\nThe next day I returned to Paris, and by a free use of my purse\nextracted from the porter the information that Mme. Gaston was legally\nmarried.\n\nHis reply to my question took the form, \"Yes, _Miss_.\"\n\nJuly 15th.\n\nMy dear, my love for Gaston is stronger than ever since that morning,\nand he has every appearance of being still more deeply in love. He is\nso young! A score of times it has been on my lips, when we rise in the\nmorning, to say, \"Then you love me better than the lady of the Rue de\nla Ville l'Eveque?\" But I dare not explain to myself why the words are\nchecked on my tongue.\n\n\"Are you very fond of children?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" was his reply; \"but children will come!\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\"\n\n\"I have consulted the best doctors, and they agree in advising me to\ntravel for a couple of months.\"\n\n\"Gaston,\" I said, \"if love in absence had been possible for me, do you\nsuppose I should ever have left the convent?\"\n\nHe laughed; but as for me, dear, the word \"travel\" pierced my heart.\nRather, far rather, would I leap from the top of the house than be\nrolled down the staircase, step by step.--Farewell, my sweetheart. I\nhave arranged for my death to be easy and without horrors, but certain.\nI made my will yesterday. You can come to me now, the prohibition is\nremoved. Come, then, and receive my last farewell. I will not die by\ninches; my death, like my life, shall bear the impress of dignity and\ngrace.\n\nGood-bye, dear sister soul, whose affection has never wavered nor grown\nweary, but has been the constant tender moonlight of my soul. If the\nintensity of passion has not been ours, at least we have been spared its\nvenomous bitterness. How rightly you have judged of life! Farewell.\n\n\n\n\nLV. THE COMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE TO MME. GASTON July 16th.\n\nMy dear Louise,--I send this letter by an express before hastening\nto the chalet myself. Take courage. Your last letter seemed to me so\nfrantic, that I thought myself justified, under the circumstances, in\nconfiding all to Louis; it was a question of saving you from yourself.\nIf the means we have employed have been, like yours, repulsive, yet the\nresult is so satisfactory that I am certain you will approve. I went so\nfar as to set the police to work, but the whole thing remains a secret\nbetween the prefect, ourselves and you.\n\nIn one word, Gaston is a jewel! But here are the facts. His brother,\nLouis Gaston, died at Calcutta, while in the service of a mercantile\ncompany, when he was on the very point of returning to France, a rich,\nprosperous, married man, having received a very large fortune with his\nwife, who was the widow of an English merchant. For ten years he had\nworked hard that he might be able to send home enough to support his\nbrother, to whom he was devotedly attached, and from whom his letters\ngenerously concealed all his trials and disappointments.\n\nThen came the failure of the great Halmer house; the widow was ruined,\nand the sudden shock affected Louis Gaston's brain. He had no mental\nenergy left to resist the disease which attacked him, and he died in\nBengal, whither he had gone to try and realize the remnants of his\nwife's property. The dear, good fellow had deposited with a banker\na first sum of three hundred thousand francs, which was to go to his\nbrother, but the banker was involved in the Halmer crash, and thus their\nlast resource failed them.\n\nLouis' widow, the handsome woman whom you took for your rival, arrived\nin Paris with two children--your nephews--and an empty purse, her\nmother's jewels having barely sufficed to pay for bringing them over.\nThe instructions which Louis Gaston had given the banker for sending\nthe money to his brother enabled the widow to find your husband's former\nhome. As Gaston had disappeared without leaving any address, Mme. Louis\nGaston was directed to d'Arthez, the only person who could give any\ninformation about him.\n\nD'Arthez was the more ready to relieve the young woman's pressing needs,\nbecause Louis Gaston, at the time of his marriage four years before, had\nwritten to make inquiries about his brother from the famous author, whom\nhe knew to be one of his friends. The Captain had consulted d'Arthez as\nto the best means of getting the money safely transferred to Marie, and\nd'Arthez had replied, telling him that Gaston was now a rich man through\nhis marriage with the Baronne de Macumer. The personal beauty, which\nwas the mother's rich heritage to her sons, had saved them both--one\nin India, the other in Paris--from destitution. A touching story, is it\nnot?\n\nD'Arthez naturally wrote, after a time, to tell your husband of the\ncondition of his sister-in-law and her children, informing him, at the\nsame time, of the generous intentions of the Indian Gaston towards his\nParis brother, which an unhappy chance had frustrated. Gaston, as you\nmay imagine, hurried off to Paris. Here is the first ride accounted for.\nDuring the last five years he had saved fifty thousand francs out of the\nincome you forced him to accept, and this sum he invested in the public\nfunds under the names of his two nephews, securing them each, in\nthis way, an income of twelve hundred francs. Next he furnished his\nsister-in-law's rooms, and promised her a quarterly allowance of three\nthousand francs. Here you see the meaning of his dramatic labors and the\npleasure caused him by the success of his first play.\n\nMme. Gaston, therefore, is no rival of yours, and has every right to\nyour name. A man of Gaston's sensitive delicacy was bound to keep the\naffair secret from you, knowing as he did, your generous nature. Nor\ndoes he look on what you give him as his own. D'Arthez read me the\nletter he had from your husband, asking him to be one of the witnesses\nat his marriage. Gaston in this declares that his happiness would have\nbeen perfect but for the one drawback of his poverty and indebtedness\nto you. A virgin soul is at the mercy of such scruples. Either they make\nthemselves felt or they do not; and when they do, it is easy to imagine\nthe conflict of feeling and embarrassment to which they give rise.\nNothing is more natural than Gaston's wish to provide in secret a\nsuitable maintenance for the woman who is his brother's widow, and who\nhad herself set aside one hundred thousand francs for him from her own\nfortune. She is a handsome woman, warm-hearted, and extremely well-bred,\nbut not clever. She is a mother; and, you may be sure, I lost my heart\nto her at first sight when I found her with one child in her arms, and\nthe other dressed like a little lord. The children first! is written in\nevery detail of her house.\n\nFar from being angry, therefore, with your beloved husband, you should\nfind in all this fresh reason for loving him. I have met him, and think\nhim the most delightful young fellow in Paris. Yes! dear child, when I\nsaw him, I had no difficulty in understanding that a woman might lose\nher head about him; his soul is mirrored in his countenance. If I were\nyou, I should settle the widow and her children at the chalet, in a\npretty little cottage which you could have built for them, and adopt the\nboys!\n\nBe at peace, then, dear soul, and plan this little surprise, in your\nturn, for Gaston.\n\n\n\n\nLVI. MME. GASTON TO THE COMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE\n\nAh! my dear friend, what can I say in answer except the cruel _\"It is\ntoo late\"_ of that fool Lafayette to his royal master? Oh! my life,\nmy sweet life, what physician will give it back to me. My own hand has\ndealt the deathblow. Alas! have I not been a mere will-o'-the-wisp,\nwhose twinkling spark was fated to perish before it reached a flame? My\neyes rain torrents of tears--and yet they must not fall when I am with\nhim. I fly to him, and he seeks me. My despair is all within. This\ntorture Dante forgot to place in his _Inferno._ Come to see me die!\n\n\n\n\nLVII. THE COMTESSE DE L'ESTORADE TO THE COMTE DE L'ESTORADE THE CHALET,\nAugust 7th.\n\nMy love,--Take the children away to Provence without me; I remain with\nLouise, who has only a few days yet to live. I cannot leave either her\nor her husband, for whose reason I fear.\n\nYou know the scrap of letter which sent me flying to Ville d'Avray,\npicking up the doctors on my way. Since then I have not left my darling\nfriend, and it has been impossible to write to you, for I have sat up\nevery night for a fortnight.\n\nWhen I arrived, I found her with Gaston, in full dress, beautiful,\nlaughing, happy. It was a heroic falsehood! They were like two lovely\nchildren together in their restored confidence. For a moment I was\ndeceived, like Gaston, by the effrontery; but Louise pressed my hand,\nwhispering:\n\n\"He must not know; I am dying.\"\n\nAn icy chill fell over me as I felt her burning hand and saw the red\nspots on her cheeks. I congratulated myself on my prudence in leaving\nthe doctors in the wood till they should be sent for.\n\n\"Leave us for a little,\" she said to Gaston. \"Two women who have not met\nfor five years have plenty of secrets to talk over, and Renee, I have no\ndoubt, has things to confide in me.\"\n\nDirectly we were alone, she flung herself into my arms, unable longer to\nrestrain her tears.\n\n\"Tell me about it,\" I said. \"I have brought with me, in case of need,\nthe best surgeon and the best physician from the hospital, and Bianchon\nas well; there are four altogether.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" she cried, \"have them in at once if they can save me, if there is\nstill time. The passion which hurried me to death now cries for life!\"\n\n\"But what have you done to yourself?\"\n\n\"I have in a few days brought myself to the last stage of consumption.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"I got myself into a profuse perspiration in the night, and then ran out\nand lay down by the side of the lake in the dew. Gaston thinks I have a\ncold, and I am dying!\"\n\n\"Send him to Paris; I will fetch the doctors myself,\" I said, as I\nrushed out wildly to the spot where I had left them.\n\nAlas! my love, after the consultation was over, not one of the doctors\ngave me the least hope; they all believe that Louise will die with the\nfall of the leaves. The dear child's constitution has wonderfully helped\nthe success of her plan. It seems she has a predisposition to this\ncomplaint; and though, in the ordinary course, she might have lived a\nlong time, a few days' folly has made the case desperate.\n\nI cannot tell you what I felt on hearing this sentence, based on such\nclear explanations. You know that I have lived in Louise as much as in\nmy own life. I was simply crushed, and could not stir to escort to the\ndoor these harbingers of evil. I don't know how long I remained lost\nin bitter thoughts, the tears running down my cheeks, when I was roused\nfrom my stupor by the words:\n\n\"So there is no hope for me!\" in a clear, angelic voice.\n\nIt was Louise, with her hand on my shoulder. She made me get up, and\ncarried me off to her small drawing-room. With a beseeching glance, she\nwent on:\n\n\"Stay with me to the end; I won't have doleful faces round me. Above\nall, I must keep the truth from _him_. I know that I have the strength\nto do it. I am full of youth and spirit, and can die standing! For\nmyself, I have no regrets. I am dying as I wished to die, still young\nand beautiful, in the perfection of my womanhood.\n\n\"As for him, I can see very well now that I should have made his\nlife miserable. Passion has me in its grips, like a struggling fawn,\nimpatient of the toils. My groundless jealousy has already wounded\nhim sorely. When the day came that my suspicions met only\nindifference--which in the long run is the rightful meed of all\njealousy--well, that would have been my death. I have had my share of\nlife. There are people whose names on the muster-roll of the world show\nsixty years of service, and yet in all that time they have not had\ntwo years of real life, whilst my record of thirty is doubled by the\nintensity of my love.\n\n\"Thus for him, as well as for me, the close is a happy one. But between\nus, dear Renee, it is different. You lose a loving sister, and that is a\nloss which nothing can repair. You alone here have the right to mourn my\ndeath.\"\n\nAfter a long pause, during which I could only see her through a mist of\ntears, she continued:\n\n\"The moral of my death is a cruel one. My dear doctor in petticoats was\nright; marriage cannot rest upon passion as its foundation, nor even\nupon love. How fine and noble is your life! keeping always to the one\nsafe road, you give your husband an ever-growing affection; while the\npassionate eagerness with which I threw myself into wedded life was\nbound in nature to diminish. Twice have I gone astray, and twice has\nDeath stretched forth his bony hand to strike my happiness. The first\ntime, he robbed me of the noblest and most devoted of men; now it is my\nturn, the grinning monster tears me from the arms of my poet husband,\nwith all his beauty and his grace.\n\n\"Yet I would not complain. Have I not known in turn two men, each the\nvery pattern of nobility--one in mind, the other in outward form? In\nFelipe, the soul dominated and transformed the body; in Gaston, one\ncould not say which was supreme--heart, mind, or grace of form. I die\nadored--what more could I wish for? Time, perhaps, in which to draw near\nthe God of whom I may have too little thought. My spirit will take its\nflight towards Him, full of love, and with the prayer that some day, in\nthe world above, He will unite me once more to the two who made a heaven\nof my life below. Without them, paradise would be a desert to me.\n\n\"To others, my example would be fatal, for mine was no common lot. To\nmeet a Felipe or a Gaston is more than mortals can expect, and therefore\nthe doctrine of society in regard to marriage accords with the natural\nlaw. Woman is weak, and in marrying she ought to make an entire\nsacrifice of her will to the man who, in return, should lay his\nselfishness at her feet. The stir which women of late years have created\nby their whining and insubordination is ridiculous, and only shows how\nwell we deserve the epithet of children, bestowed by philosophers on our\nsex.\"\n\nShe continued talking thus in the gentle voice you know so well,\nuttering the gravest truths in the prettiest manner, until Gaston\nentered, bringing with him his sister-in-law, the two children, and\nthe English nurse, whom, at Louise's request, he had been to fetch from\nParis.\n\n\"Here are the pretty instruments of my torture,\" she said, as her\nnephews approached. \"Was not the mistake excusable? What a wonderful\nlikeness to their uncle!\"\n\nShe was most friendly to Mme. Gaston the elder and begged that she would\nlook upon the chalet as her home; in short, she played the hostess to\nher in her best de Chaulieu manner, in which no one can rival her.\n\nI wrote at once to the Duc and Duchesse de Chaulieu, the Duc de Rhetore,\nand the Duc de Lenoncourt-Givry, as well as to Madeleine. It was time.\nNext day, Louise, worn out with so much exertion, was unable to go\nout; indeed, she only got up for dinner. In the course of the evening,\nMadeleine de Lenoncourt, her two brothers, and her mother arrived. The\ncoolness which Louise's second marriage had caused between herself and\nher family disappeared. Every day since that evening, Louise's father\nand both her brothers have ridden over in the morning, and the two\nduchesses spend all their evenings at the chalet. Death unites as well\nas separates; it silences all paltry feeling.\n\nLouise is perfection in her charm, her grace, her good sense, her wit,\nand her tenderness. She has retained to the last that perfect tact for\nwhich she has been so famous, and she lavishes on us the treasures of\nher brilliant mind, which made her one of the queens of Paris.\n\n\"I should like to look well even in my coffin,\" she said with her\nmatchless smile, as she lay down on the bed where she was to linger for\na fortnight.\n\nHer room has nothing of the sick-chamber in it; medicines, ointments,\nthe whole apparatus of nursing, is carefully concealed.\n\n\"Is not my deathbed pretty!\" she said to the Sevres priest who came to\nconfess her.\n\nWe gloated over her like misers. All this anxiety, and the terrible\ntruths which dawned on him, have prepared Gaston for the worst. He is\nfull of courage, but the blow has gone home. It would not surprise me\nto see him follow his wife in the natural course. Yesterday, as we were\nwalking round the lake, he said to me:\n\n\"I must be a father to those two children,\" and he pointed to his\nsister-in-law, who was taking the boys for a walk. \"But though I shall\ndo nothing to hasten my end, I want your promise that you will be a\nsecond mother to them, and will persuade your husband to accept the\noffice of guardian, which I shall depute to him in conjunction with my\nsister-in-law.\"\n\nHe said this quite simply, like a man who knows he is not long for this\nworld. He has smiles on his face to meet Louise's, and it is only I whom\nhe does not deceive. He is a mate for her in courage.\n\nLouise has expressed a wish to see her godson, but I am not sorry he\nshould be in Provence; she might want to remember him generously, and I\nshould be in a great difficulty.\n\nGood-bye, my love.\n\nAugust 25th (her birthday).\n\nYesterday evening Louise was delirious for a short time; but her\ndelirium was the prettiest babbling, which shows that even the madness\nof gifted people is not that of fools or nobodies. In a mere thread of\na voice she sang some Italian airs from _I Puritani, La Sonnambula,\nMoise_, while we stood round the bed in silence. Not one of us, not even\nthe Duc de Rhetore, had dry eyes, so clear was it to us all that her\nsoul was in this fashion passing from us. She could no longer see us!\nYet she was there still in the charm of the faint melody, with its\nsweetness not of this earth.\n\nDuring the night the death agony began. It is now seven in the morning,\nand I have just myself raised her from bed. Some flicker of strength\nrevived; she wished to sit by her window, and asked for Gaston's hand.\nAnd then, my love, the sweetest spirit whom we shall ever see on this\nearth departed, leaving us the empty shell.\n\nThe last sacrament had been administered the evening before, unknown to\nGaston, who was taking a snatch of sleep during this agonizing ceremony;\nand after she was moved to the window, she asked me to read her the _De\nProfundis_ in French, while she was thus face to face with the lovely\nscene, which was her handiwork. She repeated the words after me to\nherself, and pressed the hands of her husband, who knelt on the other\nside of the chair.\n\nAugust 26th.\n\nMy heart is broken. I have just seen her in her winding-sheet; her\nface is quite pale now with purple shadows. Oh! I want my children! my\nchildren! Bring me my children!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\n\n     The following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\n\n     Arthez, Daniel d'\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n       The Member for Arcis\n       The Secrets of a Princess\n\n     Beauseant, Marquise de\n       The Deserted Woman\n\n     Bianchon, Horace\n       Father Goriot\n       The Atheist's Mass\n       Cesar Birotteau\n       The Commission in Lunacy\n       Lost Illusions\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       The Secrets of a Princess\n       The Government Clerks\n       Pierrette\n       A Study of Woman\n       Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n       Honorine\n       The Seamy Side of History\n       The Magic Skin\n       A Second Home\n       A Prince of Bohemia\n       The Muse of the Department\n       The Imaginary Mistress\n       The Middle Classes\n       Cousin Betty\n       The Country Parson\n     In addition, M.

His father was a man of means and position, and he\r\npersonally supervised the early education of his son. The young\r\nGoethe studied at the universities of Leipsic and Strasburg, and in\r\n1772 entered upon the practise of law at Wetzlar. At the invitation\r\nof Karl August, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, he went in 1775 to live in\r\nWeimar, where he held a succession of political offices, becoming\r\nthe Duke's chief adviser. From 1786 to 1788 he traveled in Italy,\r\nand from 179' to 1817 directed the ducal theater at Weimar. He\r\ntook part in the wars against France, 1792-3, and in the following\r\nyear began his friendship with Schiller, which lasted till the latter's\r\ndeath in 1805. In 1806 he married Christiane Vulpius. From about\r\n1794 he devoted himself chiefly to literature, and after a life of\r\nextraordinary productiveness died at Weimar, March 22, 1832.\r\nThe most important of Goethe's works produced before he went to\r\nWeimar were his tragedy \"Gotz von Berlichingen\" (1773), which\r\nfirst brought him fame, and \"The Sorrows of Young Werther,\" a\r\nnovel which obtained enormous popularity during the so-called\r\n\"Sturm und Drang\" period. During the years at Weimar before he\r\nknew Schiller he began \"Wilhelm Meister,\" wrote the dramas,\r\n\"Iphigenie,\" \"Egmont,\" and \"Torquato Tasso,\" and his \"Reinecke\r\nFuchs.\" To the period of his friendship with Schiller belong the\r\ncontinuation of \"Wilhelm Meister,\" the beautiful idyl of \"Hermann\r\nand Dorothea,\" and the \"Roman Elegies.\" In the last period,\r\nbetween Schiller's death in 1805 and his own, appeared \"Faust,\"\r\n\"Elective Affinities,\" his autobiographical \"Dichtung und\r\nWahrheit\" (\"Poetry and Truth\"), his \"Italian Journey,\" much\r\nscientific work, and a series of treatises on German Art.\r\n\r\nThough the foregoing enumeration contains but a selection front\r\nthe titles of Goethe's best known writings, it suffices to show the\r\nextraordinary fertility and versatility of his genius. Rarely has a\r\nman of letters had so full and varied a life, or been capable of so\r\nmany-sided a development. His political and scientific activities,\r\nthough dwarfed in the eyes of our generation by his artistic\r\nproduction, yet showed the adaptability of his talent in the most\r\ndiverse directions, and helped to give him that balance of temper\r\nand breadth of vision in which he has been surpassed by no genius\r\nof the ancient or modern world.\r\n\r\nThe greatest and most representative expression of Goethe's\r\npowers is without doubt to be found in his drama of \"Faust\"; but\r\nbefore dealing with Goethe's masterpiece, it is worth while to say\r\nsomething of the history of the story on which it is founded--the\r\nmost famous instance of the old and widespread legend of the man\r\nwho sold his soul to the devil. The historical Dr. Faust seems to\r\nhave been a self-called philosopher who traveled about Germany\r\nin the first half of the sixteenth century, making money by the\r\npractise of magic, fortune-telling, and pretended cures. He died\r\nmysteriously about 1540, and a legend soon sprang up that the\r\ndevil, by whose aid he wrought his wonders, had finally carried\r\nhim off. In 1587 a life of him appeared, in which are attributed to\r\nhim many marvelous exploits and in which he is held up as an\r\nawful warning against the excessive desire for secular learning and\r\nadmiration for antique beauty which characterized the humanist\r\nmovement of the time. In this aspect the Faust legend is an\r\nexpression of early popular Protestantism, and of its antagonism to\r\nthe scientific and classical tendencies of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nWhile a succession of Faust books were appearing in Germany, the\r\noriginal life was translated into English and dramatized by\r\nMarlowe. English players brought Marlowe's work back to\r\nGermany, where it was copied by German actors, degenerated into\r\nspectacular farce, and finally into a puppet show. Through this\r\npuppet show Goethe made acquaintance with the legend.\r\n\r\nBy the time that Goethe was twenty, the Faust legend had\r\nfascinated his imagination; for three years before he went to\r\nWeimar he had been working on scattered scenes and bits of\r\ndialogue; and though he suspended actual composition on it during\r\nthree distinct periods, it was always to resume, and he closed his\r\nlabors upon it only with his life. Thus the period of time between\r\nhis first experiments and the final touches is more than sixty years.\r\nDuring this period the plans for the structure and the signification\r\nof the work inevitably underwent profound modifications, and\r\nthese have naturally affected the unity of the result; but, on the\r\nother hand, this long companionship and persistent recurrence to\r\nthe task from youth to old age have made it in a unique way the\r\nrecord of Goethe's personality in all its richness and diversity.\r\n\r\nThe drama was given to the public first as a fragment in 1790; then\r\nthe completed First Part appeared in 1808; and finally the Second\r\nPart was published in 1833, the year after the author's death.\r\nWriting in \"Dichtung und Wahrheit\" of the period about 1770,\r\nwhen he was in Strasburg with. Herder, Goethe says, \"The\r\nsignificant puppet-play legend . . . echoed and buzzed in many\r\ntones within me. I too had drifted about in all knowledge, and\r\nearly enough had been brought to feel the vanity of it. I too had\r\nmade all sorts of experiments in life, and had always come back\r\nmore unsatisfied and more tormented. I was now carrying these\r\nthings, like many others, about with me and delighting myself with\r\nthem in lonely hours, but without writing anything down.\" Without\r\ngoing into the details of the experience which underlies these\r\nwords, we can see the be ginning of that sympathy with the hero of\r\nthe old story that was the basis of its fascination and that\r\naccounted for Goethe's departure from the traditional catastrophe\r\nof Faust's damnation.\r\n\r\nOf the elements in the finished Faust that are derived from the\r\nlegend a rough idea may be obtained from the \"Doctor Faustus\" of\r\nMarlowe, printed in the present volume. As early as 1674 a life of\r\nFaust had contained the incident of the philosopher's falling in love\r\nwith a servant-girl; but the developed story of Gretchen is Goethe's\r\nown. The other elements added to the plot can be noted by a\r\ncomparison with Marlowe.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said that Goethe's \"Faust\" does not derive its\r\ngreatness from its conformity to the traditional standards of what a\r\ntragedy should be. He himself was accustomed to refer to it\r\ncynically as a monstrosity, and yet he put himself into it as\r\nintensely as Dante put himself into \"The Divine Comedy.\" A\r\npartial explanation of this apparent contradiction in the author's\r\nattitude is to be found in what has been said of its manner of\r\ncomposition. Goethe began it in his romantic youth, and availed\r\nhimself recklessly of the supernatural elements in the legend, with\r\nthe disregard of reason and plausibility characteristic of the\r\nromantic mood. When he returned to it in the beginning of the new\r\ncentury his artistic standards had changed, and the supernaturalism\r\ncould now be tolerated only by being made symbolic. Thus he\r\nmakes the career of Faust as a whole emblematic of the triumph of\r\nthe persistent striving for the ideal over the temptation to find\r\ncomplete satisfaction in the sense, and prepares the reader for this\r\ninterpretation by prefixing the \"Prologue in Heaven.\" The\r\nelaboration of this symbolic element is responsible for such scenes\r\nas the Walpurgis Night and the Intermezzo, scenes full of power\r\nand infinitely suggestive, but destructive of the unity of the play as\r\na tragedy of human life. Yet there remains in this First Part even in\r\nits final form much that is realistic in the best sense, the carousal\r\nin Auerbach's cellar, the portrait of Martha, the Easter-morning\r\nwalk, the character and fate of Margaret. It is such elements as\r\nthese that have appealed to the larger reading public and that have\r\nnaturally been emphasized by performance on the stage, and by\r\nvirtue of these alone \"Faust\" may rank as a great drama; but it is\r\nthe result of Goethe's broodings on the mystery of human life,\r\nshadowed forth in the symbolic parts and elaborated with still\r\ngreater complexity and still more far-reaching suggestiveness--and,\r\nit must be added, with deepening obscurity--in the Second Part,\r\nthat have given the work its place with \"Job,\" with the\r\n\"Prometheus Bound,\" with \"The Divine Comedy,\" and with\r\n\"Hamlet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDedication\r\n\r\nYE wavering shapes, again ye do enfold me,\r\nAs erst upon my troubled sight ye stole;\r\nShall I this time attempt to clasp, to hold ye?\r\nStill for the fond illusion yearns my soul?\r\nYe press around! Come then, your captive hold me,\r\nAs upward from the vapoury mist ye roll;\r\nWithin my breast youth's throbbing pulse is bounding,\r\nFann'd by the magic breath your march surrounding.\r\n\r\nShades fondly loved appear, your train attending,\r\nAnd visions fair of many a blissful day;\r\nFirst-love and friendship their fond accents blending,\r\nLike to some ancient, half-expiring lay;\r\nSorrow revives, her wail of anguish sending\r\nBack o'er life's devious labyrinthine way,\r\nAnd names the dear ones, they whom Fate bereaving\r\nOf life's fair hours, left me behind them grieving.\r\n\r\nThey hear me not my later cadence singing,\r\nThe souls to whom my earlier lays I sang;\r\nDispersed the throng, their severed flight now winging;\r\nMute are the voices that responsive rang.\r\nFor stranger crowds the Orphean lyre now stringing,\r\nE'en their applause is to my heart a pang;\r\nOf old who listened to my song, glad hearted,\r\nIf yet they live, now wander widely parted.\r\n\r\nA yearning long unfelt, each impulse swaying,\r\nTo yon calm spirit-realm uplifts my soul;\r\nIn faltering cadence, as when Zephyr playing,\r\nFans the Aeolian harp, my numbers roll;\r\nTear follows tear, my steadfast heart obeying\r\nThe tender impulse, loses its control;\r\nWhat I possess as from afar I see;\r\nThose I have lost become realities to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE FOR THE THEATRE\r\n\r\nMANAGER.  DRAMATIC POET.  MERRYMAN.\r\n\r\nMANAGER\r\n\r\nYE twain, in trouble and distress\r\nTrue friends whom I so oft have found,\r\nSay, for our scheme on German ground,\r\nWhat prospect have we of success?\r\nFain would I please the public, win their thanks;\r\nThey live and let live, hence it is but meet.\r\nThe posts are now erected, and the planks,\r\nAnd all look forward to a festal treat.\r\nTheir places taken, they, with eyebrows rais'd,\r\nSit patiently, and fain would be amaz'd.\r\nI know the art to hit the public taste,\r\nYet ne'er of failure felt so keen a dread;\r\nTrue, they are not accustomed to the best,\r\nBut then appalling the amount they've read..\r\nHow make our entertainment striking, new,\r\nAnd yet significant and pleasing too?\r\nFor to be plain, I love to see the throng,\r\nAs to our booth the living tide progresses;\r\nAs wave on wave successive rolls along,\r\nAnd through heaven's narrow portal forceful presses;\r\nStill in broad daylight, ere the clock strikes four,\r\nWith blows their way towards the box they take;\r\nAnd, as for bread in famine, at the baker's door,\r\nFor tickets are content their necks to break.\r\nSuch various minds the bard alone can sway,\r\nMy friend, oh work this miracle to-day!\r\n\r\nPOET\r\n\r\nOh of the motley throng speak not before me,\r\nAt whose aspect the Spirit wings its flight!\r\n\r\nConceal the surging concourse, I implore thee,\r\nWhose vortex draws us with resistless might.\r\nNo, to some peaceful heavenly nook restore me,\r\nWhere only for the bard blooms pure delight,\r\nWhere love and friendship yield their choicest blessing,\r\nOur heart's true bliss, with god-like hand caressing.\r\n\r\nWhat in the spirit's depths was there created,\r\nWhat shyly there the lip shaped forth in sound;\r\nA failure now, with words now fitly mated,\r\nIn the wild tumult of the hour is drown'd;\r\nFull oft the poet's thought for years bath waited\r\nUntil at length with perfect form 'tis crowned;\r\nWhat dazzles, for the moment born, must perish;\r\nWhat genuine is posterity will cherish.\r\n\r\nMERRYMAN\r\n\r\nThis cant about posterity I hate;\r\nAbout posterity were I to prate,\r\nWho then the living would amuse? For they\r\nWill have diversion, ay, and 'tis their due.\r\nA sprightly fellow's presence at your play,\r\nMethinks should also count for something too;\r\nWhose genial wit the audience still inspires,\r\nKnows from their changeful mood no angry feeling;\r\nA wider circle he desires,\r\nTo their heart's depths more surely thus appealing.\r\nTo work, then! Give a master-piece, my friend;\r\nBring Fancy with her choral trains before us,\r\nSense, reason, feeling, passion, but attend!\r\nLet folly also swell the tragic chorus.\r\n\r\nMANAGER\r\n\r\nIn chief, of incident enough prepare!\r\nA show they want, they come to gape and stare.\r\nSpin for their eyes abundant occupation,\r\nSO that the multitude may wondering gaze,\r\nYou by sheer bulk have won your reputation,\r\n\r\nBy mass alone can you subdue the masses,\r\nEach then selects in time what suits his bent.\r\nBring much, you something bring for various classes,\r\nAnd from the house goes every one content.\r\nYou give a piece, abroad in pieces send it!\r\n'Tis a ragout--success most needs attend it;\r\n'Tis easy to serve up, as easy to invent.\r\nA finish'd whole what boots it to present!\r\nFull soon the public will in pieces rend it.\r\n\r\nPOET\r\n\r\nHow mean such handicraft as this you cannot feel!\r\nHow it revolts the genuine artist's mind!\r\nThe sorry trash in which these coxcombs deal,\r\nIs here approved on principle, I find.\r\n\r\nMANAGER\r\n\r\nSuch a reproof disturbs me not a whit!\r\nWho on efficient work is bent,\r\nMust choose the fittest instrument.\r\nConsider! 'tis soft wood you have to split;\r\nThink too for whom you write, I pray!\r\nOne comes to while an hour away;\r\nOne from the festive board, a sated guest;\r\nOthers, more dreaded than the rest,\r\nFrom journal-reading hurry to the play.\r\nAs to a masquerade, with absent minds, they press,\r\nSheer curiosity their footsteps winging;\r\nLadies display their persons and their dress,\r\nActors unpaid their service bringing.\r\nWhat dreams beguile you on your poet's height?\r\nWhat puts a full house in a merry mood?\r\nMore closely view your patrons of the night!\r\nThe half are cold, the half are rude.\r\nOne, the play over, craves a game of cards;\r\nAnother a wild night in wanton joy would spend.\r\nPoor fools the muses' fair regards.\r\nWhy court for such a paltry end?\r\nI tell you, give them more, still more, 'tis all I ask,\r\nThus you will ne'er stray widely from the goal;\r\nYour audience seek to mystify, cajole;--\r\nTo satisfy them--that's a harder task.\r\nWhat ails thee? art enraptured or distressed?\r\n\r\nPOET\r\n\r\nDepart! elsewhere another servant choose\r\nWhat! shall the bard his godlike power abuse?\r\nMan's loftiest right, kind nature's high bequest,\r\nFor your mean purpose basely sport away?\r\nWhence comes his mastery o'er the human breast,\r\nWhence o'er the elements his sway,\r\nBut from the harmony that, gushing from his soul,\r\nDraws back into his heart the wondrous whole?\r\nWith careless hand when round her spindle, Nature\r\nWinds the interminable thread of life;\r\nWhen 'mid the clash of Being every creature\r\nMingles in harsh inextricable strife;\r\nWho deals their course unvaried till it falleth,\r\nIn rhythmic flow to music's measur'd tone?\r\nEach solitary note whose genius calleth,\r\nTo swell the mighty choir in unison?\r\nWho in the raging storm sees passion low'ring?\r\nOr flush of earnest thought in evening's glow?\r\nWho every blossom in sweet spring-time flowering\r\nAlong the loved one's path would strow?\r\nWho, Nature's green familiar leaves entwining,\r\nWreathe's glory's garland, won on every field?\r\nMakes sure Olympus, heavenly powers combining?\r\nMan's mighty spirit, in the bard reveal'd!\r\n\r\nMERRYMAN\r\n\r\nCome then, employ your lofty inspiration,\r\nAnd carry on the poet's avocation,\r\nJust as we carry on a love affair.\r\nTwo meet by chance, are pleased, they linger there,\r\nInsensibly are link'd, they scarce know how;\r\nFortune seems now propitious, adverse now,\r\nThen come alternate rapture and despair;\r\nAnd 'tis a true romance ere one's aware.\r\nJust such a drama let us now compose.\r\nPlunge boldly into life--its depths disclose!\r\nEach lives it, not to many is it known,\r\n'Twill interest wheresoever seiz'd and shown;\r\nBright pictures, but obscure their meaning:\r\nA ray of truth through error gleaming,\r\nThus you the best elixir brew,\r\nTo charm mankind, and edify them too.\r\nThen youth's fair blossoms crowd to view your play,\r\nAnd wait as on an oracle; while they,\r\nThe tender souls, who love the melting mood,\r\nSuck from your work their melancholy food;\r\nNow this one, and now that, you deeply stir,\r\nEach sees the working of his heart laid bare.\r\nTheir tears, their laughter, you command with ease,\r\nThe lofty still they honour, the illusive love.\r\nYour finish'd gentlemen you ne'er can please;\r\nA growing mind alone will grateful prove.\r\n\r\nPOET\r\n\r\nThen give me back youth's golden prime,\r\nWhen my own spirit too was growing,\r\nWhen from my heart th' unbidden rhyme\r\nGush'd forth, a fount for ever flowing;\r\nThen shadowy mist the world conceal'd,\r\nAnd every bud sweet promise made,\r\nOf wonders yet to be reveal'd,\r\nAs through the vales, with blooms inlaid,\r\nCulling a thousand flowers I stray'd.\r\nNaught had I, yet a rich profusion!\r\nThe thirst for truth, joy in each fond illusion.\r\nGive me unquell'd those impulses to prove;--\r\nRapture so deep, its ecstasy was pain,\r\nThe power of hate, the energy of love,\r\nGive me, oh give me back my youth again!\r\n\r\nMERRYMAN\r\n\r\nYouth, my good friend, you certainly require\r\nWhen foes in battle round are pressing,\r\nWhen a fair maid, her heart on fire,\r\nHangs on your neck with fond caressing,\r\nWhen from afar, the victor's crown,\r\nTo reach the hard-won goal inciteth;\r\nWhen from the whirling dance, to drown\r\nYour sense, the night's carouse inviteth.\r\nBut the familiar chords among\r\nBoldly to sweep, with graceful cunning,\r\nWhile to its goal, the verse along\r\nIts winding path is sweetly running;\r\nThis task is yours, old gentlemen, to-day;\r\nNor are you therefore less in reverence held;\r\nAge does not make us childish, as folk say,\r\nIt finds us genuine children e'en in eld.\r\n\r\nMANAGER\r\n\r\nA truce to words, mere empty sound,\r\nLet deeds at length appear, my friends!\r\nWhile idle compliments you round,\r\nYou might achieve some useful ends.\r\nWhy talk of the poetic vein?\r\nWho hesitates will never know it;\r\nIf bards ye are, as ye maintain,\r\nNow let your inspiration show it.\r\nTo you is known what we require,\r\nStrong drink to sip is our desire;\r\nCome, brew me such without delay!\r\nTo-morrow sees undone, what happens not to-day\r\nStill forward press, nor ever tire!\r\nThe possible, with steadfast trust,\r\nResolve should by the forelock grasp;\r\nThen she will ne'er let go her clasp,\r\nAnd labours on, because she must.\r\nTherefore in bringing out your play,\r\nNor scenes nor mechanism spare!\r\nHeaven's lamps employ, the greatest and the least,\r\nBe lavish of the stellar lights,\r\nWater, and fire, and rocky heights,\r\nSpare not at all, nor birds, nor beast.\r\nThus let creation's ample sphere\r\nForthwith in this our narrow booth appear,\r\nAnd with considerate speed, through fancy's spell,\r\nJourney from heaven, thence through the world, to hell!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE IN HEAVEN\r\n\r\nTHE LORD.

Philosophy,\r\nMedicine, Jurisprudence too,\r\nAnd to my cost Theology,\r\nWith ardent labour, studied through.\r\nAnd here I stand, with all my lore,\r\nPoor fool, no wiser than before.\r\nMagister, doctor styled, indeed,\r\nAlready these ten years I lead,\r\nUp, down, across, and to and fro,\r\nMy pupils by the nose,--and learn,\r\nThat we in truth can nothing know!\r\nThat in my heart like fire doth burn.\r\n'Tis true I've more cunning than all your dull tribe,\r\nMagister and doctor, priest, parson, and scribe;\r\nScruple or doubt comes not to enthrall me,\r\nNeither can devil nor hell now appal me--\r\nHence also my heart must all pleasure forego!\r\nI may not pretend, aught rightly to know,\r\nI may not pretend, through teaching, to find\r\nA means to improve or convert mankind.\r\nThen I have neither goods nor treasure,\r\nNo worldly honour, rank, or pleasure;\r\nNo dog in such fashion would longer live!\r\nTherefore myself to magic I give,\r\nIn hope, through spirit-voice and might,\r\nSecrets now veiled to bring to light,\r\nThat I no more, with aching brow,\r\nNeed speak of what I nothing know;\r\nThat I the force may recognise\r\nThat binds creation's inmost energies;\r\nHer vital powers, her embryo seeds survey,\r\nAnd fling the trade in empty words away.\r\nO full-orb'd moon, did but thy rays\r\nTheir last upon mine anguish gaze!\r\nBeside this desk, at dead of night,\r\nOft have I watched to hail thy light:\r\nThen, pensive friend! o'er book and scroll,\r\nWith soothing power, thy radiance stole!\r\nIn thy dear light, ah, might I climb,\r\nFreely, some mountain height sublime,\r\nRound mountain caves with spirits ride,\r\nIn thy mild haze o'er meadows glide,\r\nAnd, purged from knowledge-fumes, renew\r\nMy spirit, in thy healing dew!\r\nWoe's me! still prison'd in the gloom\r\nOf this abhorr'd and musty room!\r\nWhere heaven's dear light itself doth pass,\r\nBut dimly through the painted glass!\r\nHemmed in by book-heaps, piled around,\r\nWorm-eaten, hid 'neath dust and mould,\r\nWhich to the high vault's topmost bound,\r\nA smoke-stained paper doth enfold;\r\nWith boxes round thee piled, and glass,\r\nAnd many a useless instrument,\r\nWith old ancestral lumber blent--\r\nThis is thy world! a world! alas!\r\nAnd dost thou ask why heaves thy heart,\r\nWith tighten'd pressure in thy breast?\r\nWhy the dull ache will not depart,\r\nBy which thy life-pulse is oppress'd?\r\nInstead of nature's living sphere,\r\nCreated for mankind of old,\r\nBrute skeletons surround thee here,\r\nAnd dead men's bones in smoke and mould.\r\n\r\nUp! Forth into the distant land!\r\nIs not this book of mystery\r\nBy Nostradamus' proper hand,\r\nAn all-sufficient guide? Thou'lt see\r\nThe courses of the stars unroll'd;\r\nWhen nature doth her thoughts unfold\r\nTo thee, thy soul shall rise, and seek\r\nCommunion high with her to hold,\r\nAs spirit doth with spirit speak!\r\nVain by dull poring to divine\r\nThe meaning of each hallow'd sign.\r\nSpirits! I feel you hov'ring near;\r\nMake answer, if my voice ye hear!\r\n\r\n(He opens the book and perceives the sign of the Macrocosmos.)\r\n\r\nAh! at this spectacle through every sense,\r\nWhat sudden ecstasy of joy is flowing!\r\nI feel new rapture, hallow'd and intense,\r\nThrough every nerve and vein with ardour glowing.\r\nWas it a god who character'd this scroll,\r\nThe tumult in my spirit healing,\r\nO'er my sad heart with rapture stealing,\r\nAnd by a mystic impulse, to my soul,\r\nThe powers of nature all around revealing.\r\nAm I a God? What light intense!\r\nIn these pure symbols do I see,\r\nNature exert her vital energy.\r\nNow of the wise man's words I learn the sense;\r\n\r\n\"Unlock'd the spirit-world is lying,\r\nThy sense is shut, thy heart is dead!\r\nUp scholar, lave, with zeal undying,\r\nThine earthly breast in the morning-red!\"\r\n(He contemplates the sign.)\r\n\r\nHow all things live and work, and ever blending,\r\nWeave one vast whole from Being's ample range!\r\nHow powers celestial, rising and descending,\r\nTheir golden buckets ceaseless interchange!\r\nTheir flight on rapture-breathing pinions winging,\r\nFrom heaven to earth their genial influence bringing,\r\nThrough the wild sphere their chimes melodious ringing!\r\n\r\nA wondrous show! but ah! a show alone!\r\nWhere shall I grasp thee, infinite nature, where?\r\nYe breasts, ye fountains of all life, whereon\r\nHang heaven and earth, from which the withered heart\r\nFor solace yearns, ye still impart\r\nYour sweet and fostering tides--where are ye--where?\r\nYe gush, and must I languish in despair?\r\n(He turns over the leaves of the book impatiently, and perceives\r\nthe sign of the Earth-spirit.)\r\n\r\nHow all unlike the influence of this sign!\r\nEarth-spirit, thou to me art nigher,\r\nE'en now my strength is rising higher,\r\nE'en now I glow as with new wine;\r\nCourage I feel, abroad the world to dare,\r\n\r\nThe woe of earth, the bliss of earth to bear,\r\nWith storms to wrestle, brave the lightning's glare,\r\nAnd mid the crashing shipwreck not despair.\r\n\r\nClouds gather over me--\r\nThe moon conceals her light--\r\nThe lamp is quench'd--\r\nVapours are rising--\r\nQuiv'ring round my head\r\nFlash the red beams--\r\nDown from the vaulted roof\r\nA shuddering horror floats,\r\nAnd seizes me!\r\nI feel it, spirit, prayer-compell'd, 'tis thou\r\nArt hovering near!\r\nUnveil thyself!\r\nHa! How my heart is riven now!\r\nEach sense, with eager palpitation,\r\nIs strain'd to catch some new sensation!\r\nI feel my heart surrender'd unto thee!\r\nThou must! Thou must! Though life should be the fee!\r\n(He seizes the book, and pronounces mysteriously the sign\r\nof the spirit. A ruddy flame flashes up; the spirit appears in the\r\nflame.)\r\n\r\nSPIRIT\r\n\r\nWho calls me?\r\nFAUST (turning aside)\r\nDreadful shape!\r\n\r\nSPIRIT\r\n\r\nWith might, thou hast compelled me to appear,\r\nLong hast been sucking at my sphere,\r\nAnd now--\r\n\r\nFAUST\r\n\r\nWoe's me!

Where's now the soul's deep cry?\r\nWhere is the breast, which in its depths a world conceiv'd\r\nAnd bore and cherished? which, with ecstasy,\r\nTo rank itself with us, the spirits, heaved?\r\nWhere art thou, Faust? whose voice I heard resound,\r\nWho towards me press'd with energy profound?\r\nArt thou he? Thou,--who by my breath art blighted,\r\nWho, in his spirit's depths affrighted,\r\nTrembles, a crush'd and writhing worm!\r\n\r\nFAUST\r\n\r\nShall I yield, thing of flame, to thee?\r\nFaust, and thine equal, I am he!\r\n\r\nSPIRIT\r\n\r\nIn the currents of life, in action's storm,\r\nI float and I wave\r\nWith billowy motion!\r\nBirth and the grave\r\nA limitless ocean,\r\nA constant weaving\r\nWith change still rife,\r\nA restless heaving,\r\nA glowing life--\r\nThus time's whirring loom unceasing I ply,\r\nAnd weave the life-garment of deity.\r\n\r\nFAUST\r\n\r\nThou, restless spirit, dost from end to end\r\nO'ersweep the world; how near I feel to thee!\r\n\r\nSPIRIT\r\n\r\nThou'rt like the spirit, thou dost comprehend,\r\nNot me!

Do not tremble, love!\r\nLet this hand-pressure, let this glance reveal\r\nFeelings, all power of speech above;\r\nTo give oneself up wholly and to feel\r\nA joy that must eternal prove!\r\nEternal!--Yes, its end would be despair.\r\nNo end!--It cannot end!\r\n(MARGARET presses his hand, extricates herself,\r\nand runs away.

Thou gav'st me, gav'st me all\r\nFor which I prayed! Not vainly hast thou turn'd\r\nTo me thy countenance in flaming fire:\r\nGayest me glorious nature for my realm,\r\nAnd also power to feel her and enjoy;\r\nNot merely with a cold and wondering glance,\r\nThou dost permit me in her depths profound,\r\nAs in the bosom of a friend to gaze.\r\nBefore me thou dost lead her living tribes,\r\nAnd dost in silent grove, in air and stream\r\nTeach me to know my kindred. And when roars\r\nThe howling storm-blast through the groaning wood,\r\nWrenching the giant pine, which in its fall\r\nCrashing sweeps down its neighbour trunks and boughs,\r\nWhile hollow thunder from the hill resounds;\r\nThen thou dost lead me to some shelter'd cave,\r\nDost there reveal me to myself, and show\r\nOf my own bosom the mysterious depths.\r\nAnd when with soothing beam, the moon's pale orb\r\nFull in my view climbs up the pathless sky,\r\nFrom crag and dewy grove, the silvery forms\r\nOf by-gone ages hover, and assuage\r\nThe joy austere of contemplative thought.\r\n\r\nOh, that naught perfect is assign'd to man,\r\nI feel, alas! With this exalted joy,\r\nWhich lifts me near and nearer to the gods,\r\nThou gav'st me this companion, unto whom\r\nI needs must cling, though cold and insolent,\r\nHe still degrades me to myself, and turns\r\nThy glorious gifts to nothing, with a breath.\r\nHe in my bosom with malicious zeal\r\nFor that fair image fans a raging fire;\r\nFrom craving to enjoyment thus I reel,\r\nAnd in enjoyment languish for desire. (MEPHISTOPHELES\r\nenters.)\r\n\r\nMEPHISTOPHELES\r\n\r\nOf this lone life have you not had your fill?\r\nHow for so long can it have charms for you?\r\n'Tis well enough to try it if you will;\r\nBut then away again to something new!\r\n\r\nFAUST\r\n\r\nWould you could better occupy your leisure,\r\nThan in disturbing thus my hours of joy.\r\n\r\nMEPHISTOPHELES\r\n\r\nWell! Well!

Thy true love dwells apart,\r\nAnd all to her seems flat and tame;\r\nAlone thine image fills her heart,\r\nShe loves thee with an all-devouring flame.\r\nFirst came thy passion with o'erpowering rush,\r\nLike mountain torrent, swollen by the melted snow;\r\nPull in her heart didst pour the sudden gush,\r\nNow has thy brookiet ceased to flow.\r\nInstead of sitting throned midst forests wild,\r\nIt would become so great a lord\r\nTo comfort the enamour'd child,\r\nAnd the young monkey for her love reward.\r\nTo her the hours seem miserably long;\r\nShe from the window sees the clouds float by\r\nAs o'er the lofty city-walls they fly,\r\n\"If I a birdie were!\" so runs her song,\r\nHalf through the night and all day long.\r\nCheerful sometimes, more oft at heart full sore;\r\nFairly outwept seem now her tears,\r\nAnon she tranquil is, or so appears,\r\nAnd love-sick evermore.\r\n\r\nFAUST\r\n\r\nSnake!

Every now and again he bent to the ground. Hobbits go light, and their footprints are not easy even for a Ranger to read, but not far from the top a spring crossed the path, and in the wet earth he saw what he was seeking.\n\n'I read the signs aright,' he said to himself. 'Frodo ran to the hill-top. I wonder what he saw there? But he returned by the same way, and went down the hill again.'\n\nAragorn hesitated. He desired to go to the high seat himself, hoping to see there something that would guide him in his perplexities; but time was pressing. Suddenly he leaped forward, and ran to the summit, across the great flag-stones, and up the steps. Then sitting in the high seat he looked out. But the sun seemed darkened, and the world dim and remote. He turned from the North back again to North, and saw nothing save the distant hills, unless it were that far away he could see again a great bird like an eagle high in the air, descending slowly in wide circles down towards the earth.\n\nEven as he gazed his quick ears caught sounds in the woodlands below, on the west side of the River. He stiffened. There were cries, and among them, to his horror, he could distinguish the harsh voices of Orcs. Then suddenly with a deep-throated call a great horn blew, and the blasts of it smote the hills and echoed in the hollows, rising in a mighty shout above the roaring of the falls.\n\n'The horn of Boromir!' he cried. 'He is in need!' He sprang down the steps and away, leaping down the path. 'Alas! An ill fate is on me this day, and all that I do goes amiss. Where is Sam?'\n\nAs he ran the cries came louder, but fainter now and desperately the horn was blowing. Fierce and shrill rose the yells of the Orcs, and suddenly the horn-calls ceased. Aragorn raced down the last slope, but before he could reach the hill's foot, the sounds died away; and as he turned to the left and ran towards them they retreated, until at last he could hear them no more. Drawing his bright sword and crying Elendil! Elendil! he crashed through the trees.\n\nA mile, maybe, from Parth Galen in a little glade not far from the lake he found Boromir. He was sitting with his back to a great tree, as if he was resting. But Aragorn saw that he was pierced with many black-feathered arrows; his sword was still in his hand, but it was broken near the hilt; his horn cloven in two was at his side. Many Orcs lay slain, piled all about him and at his feet.\n\nAragorn knelt beside him. Boromir opened his eyes and strove to speak. At last slow words came. 'I tried to take the Ring from Frodo,' he said. 'I am sorry. I have paid.' His glance strayed to his fallen enemies; twenty at least lay there. 'They have gone: the Halflings: the Orcs have taken them. I think they are not dead. Orcs bound them.' He paused and his eyes closed wearily. After a moment he spoke again.\n\n'Farewell, Aragorn! Go to Minas Tirith and save my people! I have failed.'\n\n'No!' said Aragorn, taking his hand and kissing his brow. 'You have conquered. Few have gained such a victory. Be at peace! Minas Tirith shall not fall!'\n\nBoromir smiled.\n\n'Which way did they go? Was Frodo there?' said Aragorn.\n\nBut Boromir did not speak again.\n\n'Alas!' said Aragorn. 'Thus passes the heir of Denethor, Lord of the Tower of Guard! This is a bitter end. Now the Company is all in ruin. It is I that have failed. Vain was Gandalf's trust in me. What shall I do now? Boromir has laid it on me to go to Minas Tirith, and my heart desires it; but where are the Ring and the Bearer? How shall I find them and save the Quest from disaster?'\n\nHe knelt for a while, bent with weeping, still clasping Boromir's hand. So it was that Legolas and Gimli found him. They came from the western slopes of the hill, silently, creeping through the trees as if they were hunting. Gimli had his axe in hand, and Legolas his long knife: all his arrows were spent. When they came into the glade they halted in amazement; and then they stood a moment with heads bowed in grief, for it seemed to them plain what had happened.\n\n'Alas!' said Legolas, coming to Aragorn's side. 'We have hunted and slain many Orcs in the woods, but we should have been of more use here. We came when we heard the horn \u0426 but too late, it seems. I fear you have taken deadly hurt.'\n\n'Boromir is dead,' said Aragorn. 'I am unscathed, for I was not here with him. He fell defending the hobbits, while I was away upon the hill.'\n\n'The hobbits!' cried Gimli 'Where are they then? Where is Frodo?'\n\n'I do not know,' answered Aragorn wearily. 'Before he died Boromir told me that the Orcs had bound them; he did not think that they were dead. I sent him to follow Merry and Pippin; but I did not ask him if Frodo or Sam were with him: not until it was too late. All that I have done today has gone amiss. What is to be done now?'\n\n'First we must tend the fallen,' said Legolas. 'We cannot leave him lying like carrion among these foul Orcs.'\n\n'But we must be swift,' said Gimli. 'He would not wish us to linger. We must follow the Orcs, if there is hope that any of our Company are living prisoners.'\n\n'But we do not know whether the Ring-bearer is with them or not,' said Aragorn. 'Are we to abandon him? Must we not seek him first? An evil choice is now before us!'\n\n'Then let us do first what we must do,' said Legolas. 'We have not the time or the tools to bury our comrade fitly, or to raise a mound over him. A cairn we might build.'\n\n'The labour would be hard and long: there are no stones that we could use nearer than the water-side,' said Gimli.\n\n'Then let us lay him in a boat with his weapons, and the weapons of his vanquished foes,' said Aragorn. 'We will send him to the Falls of Rauros and give him to Anduin. The River of Gondor will take care at least that no evil creature dishonours his bones.'\n\nQuickly they searched the bodies of the Orcs, gathering their swords and cloven helms and shields into a heap. 'See!' cried Aragorn. 'Here we find tokens!' He picked out from the pile of grim weapons two knives, leaf-bladed, damasked in gold and red; and searching further he found also the sheaths, black, set with small red gems. 'No orc-tools these!' he said. 'They were borne by the hobbits. Doubtless the Orcs despoiled them, but feared to keep the knives, knowing them for what they are: work of Westernesse, wound about with spells for the bane of Mordor. Well, now, if they still live, our friends are weaponless. I will take these things, hoping against hope, to give them back.'\n\n'And I,' said Legolas, 'will take all the arrows that I can find, for my quiver is empty.' He searched in the pile and on the ground about and found not a few that were undamaged and longer in the shaft than such arrows as the Orcs were accustomed to use. He looked at them closely.\n\nAnd Aragorn looked on the slain, and he said: 'Here lie many that are not folk of Mordor. Some are from the North, from the Misty Mountains, if I know anything of Orcs and their kinds. And here are others strange to me. Their gear is not after the manner of Orcs at all!'\n\nThere were four goblin-soldiers of greater stature, swart, slant-eyed, with thick legs and large hands. They were armed with short broad-bladed swords, not with the curved scimitars usual with Orcs: and they had bows of yew, in length and shape like the bows of Men. Upon their shields they bore a strange device: a small white hand in the centre of a black field; on the front of their iron helms was set an S-rune, wrought of some white metal.\n\n'I have not seen these tokens before,' said Aragorn. 'What do they mean?'\n\n'S is for Sauron,' said Gimli. 'That is easy to read.'\n\n'Nay!' said Legolas. 'Sauron does not use the Elf-runes.'\n\n'Neither does he use his right name, nor permit it to be spelt or spoken,' said Aragorn. 'And he does not use white. The Orcs in the service of Barad-dur use the sign of the Red Eye.' He stood for a moment in thought. 'S is for Saruman, I guess,' he said at length. 'There is evil afoot in Isengard, and the West is no longer safe. It is as Gandalf feared: by some means the traitor Saruman has had news of our journey. It is likely too that he knows of Gandalf's fall. Pursuers from Moria may have escaped the vigilance of Lorien, or they may have avoided that land and come to Isengard by other paths. Orcs travel fast. But Saruman has many ways of learning news. Do you remember the birds?'\n\n'Well, we have no time to ponder riddles,' said Gimli. 'Let us bear Boromir away!'\n\n'But after that we must guess the riddles, if we are to choose our course rightly,' answered Aragorn.\n\n'Maybe there is no right choice,' said Gimli.\n\nTaking his axe the Dwarf now cut several branches. These they lashed together with bowstrings, and spread their cloaks upon the frame. Upon this rough bier they carried the body of their companion to the shore, together with such trophies of his last battle as they chose to send forth with him. It was only a short way, yet they found it no easy task, for Boromir was a man both tall and strong.\n\nAt the water-side Aragorn remained, watching the bier, while Legolas and Gimli hastened back on foot to Parth Galen. It was a mile or more, and it was some time before they came back, paddling two boats swiftly along the shore.\n\n'There is a strange tale to tell!' said Legolas. 'There are only two boats upon the bank. We could find no trace of the other.'\n\n'Have Orcs been there?' asked Aragorn.\n\n'We saw no signs of them,' answered Gimli. 'And Orcs would have taken or destroyed all the boats, and the baggage as well.'\n\n'I will look at the ground when we come there,' said Aragorn.\n\nNow they laid Boromir in the middle of the boat that was to bear him away. The grey hood and elven-cloak they folded and placed beneath his head. They combed his long dark hair and arrayed it upon his shoulders. The golden belt of Lorien gleamed about his waist. His helm they set beside him, and across his lap they laid the cloven horn and the hilts and shards of his sword; beneath his feet they put the swords of his enemies. Then fastening the prow to the stern of the other boat, they drew him out into the water. They rowed sadly along the shore, and turning into the swift-running channel they passed the green sward of Parth Galen. The steep sides of Tol Brandir were glowing: it was now mid-afternoon. As they went south the fume of Rauros rose and shimmered before them, a haze of gold. The rush and thunder of the falls shook the windless air.\n\nSorrowfully they cast loose the funeral boat: there Boromir lay, restful, peaceful, gliding upon the bosom of the flowing water. The stream took him while they held their own boat back with their paddles. He floated by them, and slowly his boat departed, waning to a dark spot against the golden light; and then suddenly it vanished. Rauros roared on unchanging. The River had taken Boromir son of Denethor, and he was not seen again in Minas Tirith, standing as he used to stand upon the White Tower in the morning. But in Gondor in after-days it long was said that the elven-boat rode the falls and the foaming pool, and bore him down through Osgiliath, and past the many mouths of Anduin, out into the Great Sea at night under the stars.\n\nFor a while the three companions remained silent, gazing after him. Then Aragorn spoke. 'They will look for him from the White Tower,' he said, 'but he will not return from mountain or from sea.' Then slowly he began to sing:\n\n\t\tThrough Rohan over fen and field where the long grass grows\n\t\tThe West Wind comes walking, and about the walls it goes.\n\t\t'What news from the West, O wandering wind, do you bring to me tonight?\n\t\tHave you seen Boromir the Tall by moon or by starlight?'\n\t\t'I saw him ride over seven streams, over waters wide and grey;\n\t\tI saw him walk in empty lands, until he passed away\n\t\tInto the shadows of the North. I saw him then no more.\n\t\tThe North Wind may have heard the horn of the son of Denethor.'\n\t\t'O Boromir! From the high walls westward I looked afar,\n\t\tBut you came not from the empty lands where no men are.'\n\nThen Legolas sang:\n\n\t\tFrom the mouths of the Sea the South Wind flies, from the sandhills and the stones;\n\t\tThe wailing of the gulls it bears, and at the gate it moans.\n\t\t'What news from the South, O sighing wind, do you bring to me at eve?\n\t\tWhere now is Boromir the Fair? He tarries and I grieve.'\n\t\t'Ask not of me where he doth dwell \u0426 so many bones there lie\n\t\tOn the white shores and the dark shores under the stormy sky;\n\t\tSo many have passed down Anduin to find the flowing Sea.\n\t\tAsk of the North Wind news of them the North Wind sends to me!'\n\t\t'O Boromir! Beyond the gate the seaward road runs south,\n\t\tBut you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey sea's mouth.'\n\nThen Aragorn sang again:\n\n\t\tFrom the Gate of Kings the North Wind rides, and past the roaring falls;\n\t\tAnd clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls.\n\t\t'What news from the North, O mighty wind, do you bring to me today?\n\t\tWhat news of Boromir the Bold? For he is long away.'\n\t\t'Beneath Amon Hen I heard his cry. There many foes he fought.\n\t\tHis cloven shield, his broken sword, they to the water brought.\n\t\tHis head so proud, his face so fair, his limbs they laid to rest;\n\t\tAnd Rauros, golden Rauros-falls, bore him upon its breast.'\n\t\t'O Boromir! The Tower of Guard shall ever northward gaze\n\t\tTo Rauros, golden Rauros-falls, until the end of days.'\n\nSo they ended. Then they turned their boat and drove it with all the speed they could against the stream back to Parth Galen.\n\n'You left the East Wind to me,' said Gimli, 'but I will say naught of it.'\n\n'That is as it should be,' said Aragorn. 'In Minas Tirith they endure the East Wind, but they do not ask it for tidings. But now Boromir has taken his road, and we must make haste to choose our own.'\n\nHe surveyed the green lawn, quickly but thoroughly, stooping often to the earth. 'The Orcs have been on this ground,' he said. 'Otherwise nothing can be made out for certain. All our footprints are here, crossing and re-crossing. I cannot tell whether any of the hobbits have come back since the search for Frodo began.' He returned to the bank, close to where the rill from the spring trickled out into the River. 'There are some clear prints here,' he said. 'A hobbit waded out into the water and back; but I cannot say how long ago.'\n\n'How then do you read this riddle?' asked Gimli.\n\nAragorn did not answer at once, but went back to the camping-place and looked at the baggage. 'Two packs are missing.' he said, 'and one is certainly Sam's: it was rather large and heavy. This then is the answer: Frodo has gone by boat, and his servant has gone with him. Frodo must have returned while we were all away. I met Sam going up the hill and told him to follow me; but plainly he did not do so. He guessed his master's mind and came back here before Frodo had gone. He did not find it easy to leave Sam behind!'\n\n'But why should he leave us behind, and without a word?' said Gimli. 'That was a strange deed!'\n\n'And a brave deed,' said Aragorn. 'Sam was right, I think. Frodo did not wish to lead any friend to death with him in Mordor. But he knew that he must go himself. Something happened after he left us that overcame his fear and doubt.'\n\n'Maybe hunting Orcs came on him and he fled,' said Legolas.\n\n'He fled, certainly,' said Aragorn, 'but not, I think, from Orcs.' What he thought was the cause of Frodo's sudden resolve and flight Aragorn did not say. The last words of Boromir he long kept secret.\n\n'Well, so much at least is now clear,' said Legolas: 'Frodo is no longer on this side of the River: only he can have taken the boat. And Sam is with him; only he would have taken his pack.'\n\n'Our choice then,' said Gimli, 'is either to take the remaining boat and follow Frodo, or else to follow the Orcs on foot. There is little hope either way. We have already lost precious hours.'\n\n'Let me think!' said Aragorn. 'And now may I make a right choice and change the evil fate of this unhappy day!' He stood silent for a moment. 'I will follow the Orcs,' he said at last. 'I would have guided Frodo to Mordor and gone with him to the end; but if I seek him now in the wilderness, I must abandon the captives to torment and death. My heart speaks clearly at last: the fate of the Bearer is in my hands no longer. The Company has played its part. Yet we that remain cannot forsake our companions while we have strength left. Come! We will go now. Leave all that can be spared behind! We will press on by day and dark!'\n\nThey drew up the last boat and carried it to the trees. They laid beneath it such of their goods as they did not need and could not carry away. Then they left Parth Galen. The afternoon was fading as they came back to the glade where Boromir had fallen. There they picked up the trail of the Orcs. It needed little skill to find.\n\n'No other folk make such a trampling,' said Legolas. 'It seems their delight to slash and beat down growing things that are not even in their way.'\n\n'But they go with a great speed for all that,' said Aragorn, 'and they do not tire. And later we may have to search for our path in hard bare lands.'\n\n'Well, after them!' said Gimli. 'Dwarves too can go swiftly, and they do not tire sooner than Orcs. But it will be a long chase: they have a long start.'\n\n'Yes,' said Aragorn, 'we shall all need the endurance of Dwarves. But come! With hope or without hope we will follow the trail of our enemies. And woe to them, if we prove the swifter! We will make such a chase as shall be accounted a marvel among the Three Kindreds \u0426\u2020Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Forth the Three Hunters!'\n\nLike a deer he sprang away. Through the trees he sped. On and on he led them, tireless and swift, now that his mind was at last made up. The woods about the lake they left behind. Long slopes they climbed, dark, hard-edged against the sky already red with sunset. Dusk came. They passed away, grey shadows in a stony land.\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Riders of Rohan\n\nDusk deepened. Mist lay behind them among the trees below, and brooded on the pale margins of the Anduin, but the sky was clear. Stars came out. The waxing moon was riding in the West, and the shadows of the rocks were black. They had come to the feet of stony hills, and their pace was slower, for the trail was no longer easy to follow. Here the highlands of the Emyn Muil ran from North to South in two long tumbled ridges. The western side of each ridge was steep and difficult, but the eastward slopes were gentler, furrowed with many gullies and narrow ravines. All night the three companions scrambled in this bony land, climbing to the crest of the first and tallest ridge, and down again into the darkness of a deep winding valley on the other side.\n\nThere in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a brief space. The moon had long gone down before them, the stars glittered above them; the first light of day had not yet come over the dark hills behind. For the moment Aragorn was at a loss: the orc-trail had descended into the valley, but there it had vanished.\n\n'Which way would they turn, do you think?' said Legolas. 'Northward to take a straighter road to Isengard, or Fangorn, if that is their aim as you guess? Or southward to strike the Entwash?'\n\n'They will not make for the river, whatever mark they aim at,' said Aragorn. 'And unless there is much amiss in Rohan and the power of Saruman is greatly increased; they will take the shortest way that they can find over the fields of the Rohirrim. Let us search northwards!'\n\nThe dale ran like a stony trough between the ridged hills, and a trickling stream flowed among the boulders at the bottom. A cliff frowned upon their right; to their left rose grey slopes, dim and shadowy in the late night. They went on for a mile or more northwards. Aragorn was searching, bent towards the ground, among the folds and gullies leading up into the western ridge. Legolas was some way ahead. Suddenly the Elf gave a cry and the others came running towards him.\n\n'We have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting,' he said. 'Look!' He pointed, and they saw that what they had at first taken to be boulders lying at the foot of the slope were huddled bodies. Five dead Orcs lay there. They had been hewn with many cruel strokes, and two had been beheaded. The ground was wet with their dark blood.\n\n'Here is another riddle!' said Gimli. 'But it needs the light of day and for that we cannot wait.'\n\n'Yet however you read it, it seems not unhopeful,' said Legolas. 'Enemies of the Orcs are likely to be our friends. Do any folk dwell in these hills?'\n\n'No,' said Aragorn. 'The Rohirrim seldom come here, and it is far from Minas Tirith. It might be that some company of Men were hunting here for reasons that we do not know. Yet I think not.'\n\n'What do you think?' said Gimli.\n\n'I think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him,' answered Aragorn. 'These are Northern Orcs from far away. Among the slain are none of the great Orcs with the strange badges. There was a quarrel, I guess: it is no uncommon thing with these foul folk. Maybe there was some dispute about the road.'\n\n'Or about the captives,' said Gimli. 'Let us hope that they, too, did not meet their end here.'\n\nAragorn searched the ground in a wide circle, but no other traces of the fight could be found. They went on. Already the eastward sky was turning pale; the stars were fading, and a grey light was slowly growing. A little further north they came to a fold in which a tiny stream, falling and winding, had cut a stony path down into the valley. In it some bushes grew, and there were patches of grass upon its sides.\n\n'At last!' said Aragorn. 'Here are the tracks that we seek! Up this water-channel: this is the way that the Orcs went after their debate.'\n\nSwiftly now the pursuers turned and followed the new path. As if fresh from a night's rest they sprang from stone to stone. At last they reached the crest of the grey hill, and a sudden breeze blew in their hair and stirred their cloaks: the chill wind of dawn.\n\nTurning back they saw across the River the far hills kindled. Day leaped into the sky. The red rim of the sun rose over the shoulders of the dark land. Before them in the West the world lay still, formless and grey; but even as they looked, the shadows of night melted, the colours of the waking earth returned: green flowed over the wide meads of Rohan; the white mists shimmered in the watervales; and far off to the left, thirty leagues or more, blue and purple stood the White Mountains, rising into peaks of jet, tipped with glimmering snows, flushed with the rose of morning.\n\n'Gondor! Gondor!' cried Aragorn. 'Would that I looked on you again in happier hour! Not yet does my road lie southward to your bright streams.\n\n\t\tGondor! Gondor, between the Mountains and the Sea!\n\t\tWest Wind blew there; the light upon the Silver Tree\n\t\tFell like bright rain in gardens of the Kings of old.\n\t\tO proud walls! White towers! O winged crown and throne of gold!\n\t\tO Gondor, Gondor! Shall Men behold the Silver Tree,\n\t\tOr West Wind blow again between the Mountains and the Sea?\n\n'Now let us go!' he said, drawing his eyes away from the South, and looking out west and north to the way that he must tread.\n\nThe ridge upon which the companions stood went down steeply before their feet. Below it twenty fathoms or more, there was a wide and rugged shelf which ended suddenly in the brink of a sheer cliff: the East Wall of Rohan. So ended the Emyn Muil, and the green plains of the Rohirrim stretched away before them to the edge of sight.\n\n'Look!' cried Legolas, pointing up into the pale sky above them. 'There is the eagle again! He is very high. He seems to be flying now away, from this land back to the North. He is going with great speed. Look!'\n\n'No, not even my eyes can see him, my good Legolas,' said Aragorn. 'He must be far aloft indeed. I wonder what is his errand, if he is the same bird that I have seen before. But look! I can see something nearer at hand and more urgent; there is something moving over the plain!'\n\n'Many things,' said Legolas. 'It is a great company on foot; but I cannot say more, nor see what kind of folk they may be. They are many leagues away: twelve, I guess; but the flatness of the plain is hard to measure.'\n\n'I think, nonetheless, that we no longer need any trail to tell us which way to go,' said Gimli. 'Let us find a path down to the fields as quick as may be.'\n\n'I doubt if you will find a path quicker than the one that the Orcs chose,' said Aragorn.\n\nThey followed their enemies now by the clear light of day. It seemed that the Orcs had pressed on with all possible speed. Every now and again the pursuers found things that had been dropped or cast away: food-bags, the rinds and crusts of hard grey bread, a torn black cloak, a heavy iron-nailed shoe broken on the stones. The trail led them north along the top of the escarpment, and at length they came to a deep cleft carved in the rock by a stream that splashed noisily down. In the narrow ravine a rough path descended like a steep stair into the plain.\n\n\nAt the bottom they came with a strange suddenness on the grass of Rohan. It swelled like a green sea up to the very foot of the Emyn Muil. The falling stream vanished into a deep growth of cresses and water-plants, and they could hear it tinkling away in green tunnels, down long gentle slopes towards the fens of Entwash Vale far away. They seemed to have left winter clinging to the hills behind. Here the air was softer and warmer, and faintly scented, as if spring was already stirring and the sap was flowing again in herb and leaf. Legolas took a deep breath, like one that drinks a great draught after long thirst in barren places.\n\n'Ah! the green smell!' he said. 'It is better than much sleep. Let us run!'\n\n'Light feet may run swiftly here,' said Aragorn. 'More swiftly, maybe, than iron-shod Orcs. Now we have a chance to lessen their lead!'\n\nThey went in single file, running like hounds on a strong scent, and an eager light was in their eyes. Nearly due west the broad swath of the marching Orcs tramped its ugly slot; the sweet grass of Rohan had been bruised and blackened as they passed. Presently Aragorn gave a cry and turned aside. 'Stay!' he shouted. 'Do not follow me yet!' He ran quickly to the right, away from the main trail; for he had seen footprints that went that way, branching off from the others, the marks of small unshod feet. These, however, did not go far before they were crossed by orc-prints, also coming out from the main trail behind and in front, and then they curved sharply back again and were lost in the trampling. At the furthest point Aragorn stooped and picked up something from the grass; then he ran back.\n\n'Yes,' he said, 'they are quite plain: a hobbit's footprints. Pippin's I think. He is smaller than the other. And look at this! He held up a thing that glittered in the sunlight. It looked like the new-opened leaf of a beech-tree, fair and strange in that treeless plain.\n\n'The brooch of an elven-cloak!' cried Legolas and Gimli together.\n\n'Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall,' said Aragorn. 'This did not drop by chance: it was cast away as a token to any that might follow. I think Pippin ran away from the trail for that purpose.'\n\n'Then he at least was alive,' said Gimli. 'And he had the use of his wits, and of his legs too. That is heartening. We do not pursue in vain.'\n\n'Let us hope that he did not pay too dearly for his boldness,' said Legolas. 'Come! Let us go on! The thought of those merry young folk driven like cattle burns my heart.'\n\nThe sun climbed to the noon and then rode slowly down the sky. Light clouds came up out of the sea in the distant South and were blown away upon the breeze. The sun sank. Shadows rose behind and reached out long arms from the East. Still the hunters held on. One day now had passed since Boromir fell, and the Orcs were yet far ahead. No longer could any sight of them be seen in the level plains.\n\nAs nightshade was closing about them Aragorn halted. Only twice in the day's march had they rested for a brief while, and twelve leagues now lay between them and the eastern wall where they had stood at dawn.\n\n'We have come at last to a hard choice,' he said. 'Shall we rest by night, or shall we go on while our will and strength hold?'\n\n'Unless our enemies rest also, they will leave us far behind, if we stay to sleep.' said Legolas.\n\n'Surely even Orcs must pause on the march?' said Gimli.\n\n'Seldom will Orcs journey in the open under the sun, yet these have done so,' said Legolas. 'Certainly they will not rest by night.'\n\n'But if we walk by night, we cannot follow their trail,' said Gimli.\n\n'The trail is straight, and turns neither right nor left, as far as my eyes can see,' said Legolas.\n\n'Maybe, I could lead you at guess in the darkness and hold to the line,' said Aragorn, 'but if we strayed, or they turned aside, then when light came there might be long delay before the trail was found again.'\n\n'And there is this also,' said Gimli, 'only by day can we see if any tracks lead away. If a prisoner should escape, or if one should be carried off, eastward, say, to the Great River, towards Mordor, we might pass the signs and never know it.'\n\n'That is true,' said Aragorn. 'But if I read the signs back yonder rightly, the Orcs of the White Hand prevailed, and the whole company is now bound for Isengard. Their present course bears me out.'\n\n'Yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels,' said Gimli. 'And what of escape? In the dark we should have passed the signs that led you to the brooch.'\n\n'The Orcs will be doubly on their guard since then, and the prisoners even wearier,' said Legolas. 'There will be no escape again, if we do not contrive it. How that is to be done cannot be guessed, but first we must overtake them.'\n\n'And yet even I, Dwarf of many journeys, and not the least hardy of my folk, cannot run all the way to Isengard without any pause,' said Gimli. 'My heart burns me too, and I would have started sooner but now I must rest a little to run the better. And if we rest, then the blind night is the time to do so.'\n\n'I said that it was a hard choice,' said Aragorn. 'How shall we end this debate?'\n\n'You are our guide,' said Gimli, 'and you are skilled in the chase. You shall choose.'\n\n'My heart bids me go on,' said Legolas. 'But we must hold together. I will follow your counsel.'\n\n'You give the choice to an ill chooser,' said Aragorn. 'Since we passed through the Argonath my choices have gone amiss.' He fell silent gazing north and west into the gathering night for a long while.\n\n'We will not walk in the dark,' he said at length. 'The peril of missing the trail or signs of other coming and going seems to me the greater. If the Moon gave enough light, we would use it, but alas! he sets early and is yet young and pale.'\n\n'And tonight he is shrouded anyway,' Gimli murmured. 'Would that the Lady had given us a light, such a gift as she gave to Frodo!'\n\n'It will be more needed where it is bestowed,' said Aragorn. 'With him lies the true Quest. Ours is but a small matter in the great deeds of this time. A vain pursuit from its beginning, maybe, which no choice of mine can mar or mend. Well, I have chosen. So let us use the time as best we may!'\n\nHe cast himself on the ground and fell at once into sleep, for he had not slept since their night under the shadow of Tol Brandir. Before dawn was in the sky he woke and rose. Gimli was still deep in slumber, but Legolas was standing, gazing northwards into the darkness, thoughtful and silent as a young tree in a windless night.\n\n'They are far far away,' he said sadly, turning to Aragorn. 'I know in my heart that they have not rested this night. Only an eagle could overtake them now.'\n\n'Nonetheless we will still follow as we may,' said Aragorn. Stooping he roused the Dwarf. 'Come! We must go,' he said. 'The scent is growing cold.'\n\n'But it is still dark,' said Gimli. 'Even Legolas on a hill-top could not see them till the Sun is up.'\n\n'I fear they have passed beyond my sight from hill or plain, under moon or sun,' said Legolas.\n\n'Where sight fails the earth may bring us rumour,' said Aragorn. 'The land must groan under their hated feet.' He stretched himself upon the ground with his ear pressed against the turf. He lay there motionless, for so long a time that Gimli wondered if he had swooned or fallen asleep again. Dawn came glimmering, and slowly a grey light grew about them. At last he rose, and now his friends could see his face: it was pale and drawn, and his look was troubled.\n\n'The rumour of the earth is dim and confused,' he said. 'Nothing walks upon it for many miles about us. Faint and far are the feet of our enemies. But loud are the hoofs of the horses. It comes to my mind that I heard them, even as I lay on the ground in sleep, and they troubled my dreams: horses galloping, passing in the West. But now they are drawing ever further from us, riding northward. I wonder what is happening in this land!'\n\n'Let us go!' said Legolas.\n\nSo the third day of their pursuit began. During all its long hours of cloud and fitful sun they hardly paused, now striding, now running, as if no weariness could quench the fire that burned them. They seldom spoke. Over the wide solitude they passed and their elven-cloaks faded against the background of the grey-green fields; even in the cool sunlight of mid-day few but elvish eyes would have marked them, until they were close at hand. Often in their hearts they thanked the Lady of Lorien for the gift of lembas, for they could eat of it and find new strength even as they ran.\n\nAll day the track of their enemies led straight on, going north-west without a break or turn. As once again the day wore to its end they came to long treeless slopes, where the land rose, swelling up towards a line of low humpbacked downs ahead. The orc-trail grew fainter as it bent north towards them, for the ground became harder and the grass shorter. Far away to the left the river Entwash wound, a silver thread in a green floor. No moving thing could be seen. Often Aragorn wondered that they saw no sign of beast or man. The dwellings of the Rohirrim were for the most part many leagues away to the South, under the wooded eaves of the White Mountains, now hidden in mist and cloud; yet the Horse-lords had formerly kept many herds and studs in the Eastemnet, this easterly region of their realm, and there the herdsmen had wandered much, living in camp and tent, even in winter-time. But now all the land was empty, and there was silence that did not seem to be the quiet of peace.\n\nAt dusk they halted again. Now twice twelve leagues they had passed over the plains of Rohan and the wall of the Emyn Muil was lost in the shadows of the East. The young moon was glimmering in a misty sky, but it gave small light, and the stars were veiled.\n\n'Now do I most grudge a time of rest or any halt in our chase,' said Legolas. 'The Orcs have run before us, as if the very whips of Sauron were behind them. I fear they have already reached the forest and the dark hills, and even now are passing into the shadows of the trees.'\n\nGimli ground his teeth. 'This is a bitter end to our hope and to all our toil!' he said.\n\n'To hope, maybe, but not to toil,' said Aragorn. 'We shall not turn back here. Yet I am weary.' He gazed back along the way that they had come towards the night gathering in the East. 'There is something strange at work in this land. I distrust the silence. I distrust even the pale Moon. The stars are faint; and I am weary as I have seldom been before, weary as no Ranger should be with a clear trail to follow. There is some will that lends speed to our foes and sets an unseen barrier before us: a weariness that is in the heart more than in the limb.'\n\n'Truly!' said Legolas. 'That I have known since first we came down from the Emyn Muil. For the will is not behind us but before us.' He pointed away over the land of Rohan into the darkling West under the sickle moon.\n\n'Saruman!' muttered Aragorn. 'But he shall not turn us back! Halt we must once more; for, see! even the Moon is falling into gathering cloud. But north lies our road between down and fen when day returns.'\n\nAs before Legolas was first afoot, if indeed he had ever slept. 'Awake! Awake!' he cried. 'It is a red dawn. Strange things await us by the eaves of the forest. Good or evil, I do not know; but we are called. Awake!'\n\nThe others sprang up, and almost at once they set off again. Slowly the downs drew near. It was still an hour before noon when they reached them: green slopes rising to bare ridges that ran in a line straight towards the North. At their feet the ground was dry and the turf short, but a long strip of sunken land, some ten miles wide, lay between them and the river wandering deep in dim thickets of reed and rush. Just to the West of the southernmost slope there was a great ring, where the turf had been torn and beaten by many trampling feet. From it the orc-trail ran out again, turning north along the dry skirts of the hills. Aragorn halted and examined the tracks closely.\n\n'They rested here a while,' he said, 'but even the outward trail is already old. I fear that your heart spoke truly, Legolas: it is thrice twelve hours, I guess, since the Orcs stood where we now stand. If they held to their pace, then at sundown yesterday they would reach the borders of Fangorn.'\n\n'I can see nothing away north or west but grass dwindling into mist,' said Gimli. 'Could we see the forest, if we climbed the hills?'\n\n'It is still far away,' said Aragorn. 'If I remember rightly, these downs run eight leagues or more to the north, and then north-west to the issuing of the Entwash there lies still a wide land, another fifteen leagues it may be.'\n\n'Well, let us go on,' said Gimli. 'My legs must forget the miles. They would be more willing, if my heart were less heavy.'\n\nThe sun was sinking when at last they drew near to the end of the line of downs. For many hours they had marched without rest. They were going slowly now, and Gimli's back was bent. Stone-hard are the Dwarves in labour or journey, but this endless chase began to tell on him, as all hope failed in his heart. Aragorn walked behind him, grim and silent, stooping now and again to scan some print or mark upon the ground. Only Legolas still stepped as lightly as ever, his feet hardly seeming to press the grass, leaving no footprints as he passed; but in the waybread of the Elves he found all the sustenance that he needed, and he could sleep, if sleep it could be called by Men, resting his mind in the strange paths of elvish dreams, even as he walked open-eyed in the light of this world.\n\n'Let us go up on to this green hill!' he said. Wearily they followed him, climbing the long slope, until they came out upon the top. It was a round hill smooth and bare, standing by itself, the most northerly of the downs. The sun sank and the shadows of evening fell like a curtain. They were alone in a grey formless world without mark or measure. Only far away north-west there was a deeper darkness against the dying light: the Mountains of Mist and the forest at their feet.\n\n'Nothing can we see to guide us here,' said Gimli. 'Well, now we must halt again and wear the night away. It is growing cold!'\n\n'The wind is north from the snows,' said Aragorn.\n\n'And ere morning it will be in the East,' said Legolas. 'But rest if you must. Yet do not cast all hope away. Tomorrow is unknown. Rede oft is found at the rising of the Sun.'\n\n'Three suns already have risen on our chase and brought no counsel,' said Gimli.\n\nThe night grew ever colder. Aragorn and Gimli slept fitfully, and whenever they awoke they saw Legolas standing beside them, or walking to and fro, singing softly to himself in his own tongue, and as he sang the white stars opened in the hard black vault above. So the night passed. Together they watched the dawn grow slowly in the sky, now bare and cloudless, until at last the sunrise came. It was pale and clear. The wind was in the East and all the mists had rolled away; wide lands lay bleak about them in the bitter light.\n\nAhead and eastward they saw the windy uplands of the Wold of Rohan that they had already glimpsed many days ago from the Great River. North-westward stalked the dark forest of Fangorn; still ten leagues away stood its shadowy eaves, and its further slopes faded into the distant blue. Beyond there glimmered far away, as if floating on a grey cloud, the white head of tall Methedras, the last peak of the Misty Mountains. Out of the forest the Entwash flowed to meet them, its stream now swift and narrow, and its banks deep-cloven. The orc-trail turned from the downs towards it.\n\nFollowing with his keen eyes the trail to the river, and then the river back towards the forest, Aragorn saw a shadow on the distant green, a dark swift-moving blur. He cast himself upon the ground and listened again intently. But Legolas stood beside him, shading his bright elven-eyes with his long slender hand, and he saw not a shadow, nor a blur, but the small figures of horsemen, many horsemen, and the glint of morning on the tips of their spears was like the twinkle of minute stars beyond the edge of mortal sight. Far behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads.\n\nThere was a silence in the empty fields, arid Gimli could hear the air moving in the grass.\n\n'Riders!' cried Aragorn, springing to his feet. 'Many riders on swift steeds are coming towards us!'\n\n'Yes,' said Legolas, 'there are one hundred and five. Yellow is their hair, and bright are their spears. Their leader is very tall.'\n\nAragorn smiled. 'Keen are the eyes of the Elves,' he said.\n\n'Nay! The riders are little more than five leagues distant,' said Legolas.\n\n'Five leagues or one,' said Gimli; 'we cannot escape them in this bare land. Shall we wait for them here or go on our way?'\n\n'We will wait,' said Aragorn. 'I am weary, and our hunt has failed. Or at least others were before us; for these horsemen are riding back down the orc-trail. We may get news from them.'\n\n'Or spears,' said Gimli.\n\n'There are three empty saddles, but I see no hobbits,' said Legolas.\n\n'I did not say that we should hear good news,' said Aragorn. 'But evil or good we will await it here.'\n\nThe three companions now left the hill-top, where they might be an easy mark against the pale sky, and they walked slowly down the northward slope. A little above the hill's foot they halted, and wrapping their cloaks about them, they sat huddled together upon the faded grass. The time passed slowly and heavily. The wind was thin and searching. Gimli was uneasy.\n\n'What do you know of these horsemen, Aragorn?' he said. 'Do we sit here waiting for sudden death?'\n\n'I have been among them,' answered Aragorn. 'They are proud and wilful, but they are true-hearted, generous in thought and deed; bold but not cruel; wise but unlearned, writing no books but singing many songs, after the manner of the children of Men before the Dark Years. But I do not know what has happened here of late, nor in what mind the Rohirrim may now be between the traitor Saruman and the threat of Sauron. They have long been the friends of the people of Gondor, though they are not akin to them. It was in forgotten years long ago that Eorl the Young brought them out of the North, and their kinship is rather with the Bardings of Dale, and with the Beornings of the Wood, among whom may still be seen many men tall and fair, as are the Riders of Rohan. At least they will not love the Orcs.'\n\n'But Gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay tribute to Mordor,' said Gimli.\n\n'I believe it no more than did Boromir,' answered Aragorn.\n\n'You will soon learn the truth,' said Legolas. 'Already they approach.'\n\nAt length even Gimli could hear the distant beat of galloping hoofs. The horsemen, following the trail, had turned from the river, and were drawing near the downs. They were riding like the wind.\n\nNow the cries of clear strong voices came ringing over the fields. Suddenly they swept up with a noise like thunder, and the foremost horseman swerved, passing by the foot of the hill, and leading the host back southward along the western skirts of the downs. After him they rode: a long line of mail-clad men, swift, shining, fell and fair to look upon.\n\nTheir horses were of great stature, strong and clean-limbed; their grey coats glistened, their long tails flowed in the wind, their manes were braided on their proud necks. The Men that rode them matched them well: tall and long-limbed; their hair, flaxen-pale, flowed under their light helms, and streamed in long braids behind them; their faces were stern and keen. In their hands were tall spears of ash, painted shields were slung at their backs, long swords were at their belts, their burnished skirts of mail hung down upon their knees.\n\nIn pairs they galloped by, and though every now and then one rose in his stirrups and gazed ahead and to either side, they appeared not to perceive the three strangers sitting silently and watching them. The host had almost passed when suddenly Aragorn stood up, and called in a loud voice:\n\n'What news from the North, Riders of Rohan?'\n\nWith astonishing speed and skill they checked their steeds, wheeled, and came charging round. Soon the three companions found themselves in a ring of horsemen moving in a running circle, up the hill-slope behind them and down, round and round them, and drawing ever inwards. Aragorn stood silent, and the other two sat without moving, wondering what way things would turn.\n\nWithout a word or cry, suddenly, the Riders halted. A thicket of spears were pointed towards the strangers; and some of the horsemen had bows in hand, and their arrows were already fitted to the string. Then one rode forward, a tall man, taller than all the rest; from his helm as a crest a white horsetail flowed. He advanced until the point of his spear was within a foot of Aragorn's breast. Aragorn did not stir.\n\n'Who are you, and what are you doing in this land?' said the Rider, using the Common Speech of the West, in manner and tone like to the speech of Boromir, Man of Gondor.\n\n'I am called Strider,' answered Aragorn. 'I came out of the North. I am hunting Orcs.'\n\nThe Rider leaped from his horse. Giving his spear to another who rode up and dismounted at his side, he drew his sword and stood face to face with Aragorn, surveying him keenly, and not without wonder. At length he spoke again.\n\n'At first I thought that you yourselves were Orcs,' he said, 'but now I see that it is not so. Indeed you know little of Orcs, if you go hunting them in this fashion. They were swift and well-armed, and they were many. You would have changed from hunters to prey, if ever you had overtaken them. But there is something strange about you, Strider.' He bent his clear bright eyes again upon the Ranger. 'That is no name for a Man that you give. And strange too is your raiment. Have you sprung out of the grass? How did you escape our sight? Are you elvish folk?'\n\n'No,' said Aragorn. 'One only of us is an Elf, Legolas from the Woodland Realm in distant Mirkwood. But we have passed through Lothlorien, and the gifts and favour of the Lady go with us.'\n\nThe Rider looked at them with renewed wonder, but his eyes hardened. 'Then there is a Lady in the Golden Wood, as old tales tell!' he said. 'Few escape her nets, they say. These are strange days! But if you have her favour, then you also are net-weavers and sorcerers, maybe.' He turned a cold glance suddenly upon Legolas and Gimli. 'Why do you not speak, silent ones?' he demanded.\n\nGimli rose and planted his feet firmly apart: his hand gripped the handle of his axe, and his dark eyes flashed. 'Give me your name, horse-master, and I will give you mine, and more besides,' he said.\n\n'As for that,' said the Rider, staring down at the Dwarf, 'the stranger should declare himself first. Yet I am named Eomer son of Eomund, and am called the Third Marshal of Riddermark.'\n\n'Then Eomer son of Eomund, Third Marshal of Riddermark, let Gimli the Dwarf Gloin's son warn you against foolish words. You speak evil of that which is fair beyond the reach of your thought, and only little wit can excuse you.'\n\nEomer's eyes blazed, and the Men of Rohan murmured angrily, and closed in, advancing their spears. 'I would cut off your head, beard and all, Master Dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the ground,' said Eomer.\n\n'He stands not alone,' said Legolas, bending his bow and fitting an arrow with hands that moved quicker than sight. 'You would die before your stroke fell.'\n\nEomer raised his sword, and things might have gone ill, but Aragorn sprang between them, and raised his hand. 'Your pardon, Eomer!' he cried. 'When you know more you will understand why you have angered my companions. We intend no evil to Rohan, nor to any of its folk, neither to man nor to horse. Will you not hear our tale before you strike?'\n\n'I will,' said Eomer lowering his blade. 'But wanderers in the Riddermark would be wise to be less haughty in these days of doubt. First tell me your right name.'\n\n'First tell me whom you serve,' said Aragorn. 'Are you friend or foe of Sauron, the Dark Lord of Mordor?'\n\n'I serve only the Lord of the Mark, Theoden King son of Thengel,' answered Eomer. 'We do not serve the Power of the Black Land far away, but neither are we yet at open war with him; and if you are fleeing from him, then you had best leave this land. There is trouble now on all our borders, and we are threatened; but we desire only to be free, and to live as we have lived, keeping our own, and serving no foreign lord, good or evil. We welcomed guests kindly in the better days, but in these times the unbidden stranger finds us swift and hard. Come! Who are you? Whom do you serve? At whose command do you hunt Orcs in our land?'\n\n'I serve no man,' said Aragorn; 'but the servants of Sauron I pursue into whatever land they may go. There are few among mortal Men who know more of Orcs; and I do not hunt them in this fashion out of choice. The Orcs whom we pursued took captive two of my friends. In such need a man that has no horse will go on foot, and he will not ask for leave to follow the trail. Nor will he count the heads of the enemy save with a sword. I am not weaponless.'\n\nAragorn threw back his cloak. The elven-sheath glittered as he grasped it, and the bright blade of Anduril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it out. 'Elendil!' he cried. 'I am Aragorn son of Arathorn and am called Elessar, the Elfstone, Dunadan, the heir of Isildur Elendil's son of Gondor. Here is the Sword that was Broken and is forged again! Will you aid me or thwart me? Choose swiftly!'\n\nGimli and Legolas looked at their companion in amazement, for they had not seen him in this mood before. He seemed to have grown in stature while Eomer had shrunk; and in his living face they caught a brief vision of the power and majesty of the kings of stone. For a moment it seemed to the eyes of Legolas that a white flame flickered on the brows of Aragorn like a shining crown.\n\nEomer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face. He cast down his proud eyes. 'These are indeed strange days,' he muttered. 'Dreams and legends spring to life out of the grass.\n\n'Tell me, lord,' he said, 'what brings you here? And what was the meaning of the dark words? Long has Boromir son of Denethor been gone seeking an answer, and the horse that we lent him came back riderless. What doom do you bring out of the North?'\n\n'The doom of choice,' said Aragorn. 'You may say this to Theoden son of Thengel: open war lies before him, with Sauron or against him. None may live now as they have lived, and few shall keep what they call their own. But of these great matters we will speak later. If chance allows, I will come myself to the king. Now I am in great need, and I ask for help, or at least for tidings. You heard that we are pursuing an orc-host that carried off our friends. What can you tell us?'\n\n'That you need not pursue them further,' said Eomer. 'The Orcs are destroyed.'\n\n'And our friends?'\n\n'We found none but Orcs.'\n\n'But that is strange indeed,' said Aragorn. 'Did you search the slain? Were there no bodies other than those of orc-kind? They would be small. Only children to your eyes, unshod but clad in grey.'\n\n'There were no dwarves nor children,' said Eomer. 'We counted all the slain and despoiled them, and then we piled the carcases and burned them, as is our custom. The ashes are smoking still.'\n\n'We do not speak of dwarves or children,' said Gimli. 'Our friends were hobbits.'\n\n'Hobbits?' said Eomer. 'And what may they be? It is a strange name.'\n\n'A strange name for a strange folk,' said Gimli. 'But these were very dear to us. It seems that you have heard in Rohan of the words that troubled Minas Tirith. They spoke of the Halfling. These hobbits are Halflings.'\n\n'Halflings!' laughed the Rider that stood beside Eomer. 'Halflings! But they are only a little people in old songs and children's tales out of the North. Do we walk in legends or on the green earth in the daylight?'\n\n'A man may do both,' said Aragorn. 'For not we but those who come after will make the legends of our time. The green earth, say you? That is a mighty matter of legend, though you tread it under the light of day!'\n\n'Time is pressing,' said the Rider, not heeding Aragorn. 'We must hasten south, lord. Let us leave these wild folk to their fancies. Or let us bind them and take them to the king.'\n\n'Peace, Eothain!' said Eomer in his own tongue. 'Leave me a while. Tell the eored to assemble on the path, and make ready to ride to the Entwade.'\n\nMuttering Eothain retired, and spoke to the others. Soon they drew off and left Eomer alone with the three companions.\n\n'All that you say is strange, Aragorn.' he said. 'Yet you speak the truth, that is plain: the Men of the Mark do not lie, and therefore they are not easily deceived. But you have not told all. Will you not now speak more fully of your errand, so that I may judge what to do?'\n\n'I set out from Imladris, as it is named in the rhyme, many weeks ago,' answered Aragorn. 'With me went Boromir of Minas Tirith. My errand was to go to that city with the son of Denethor, to aid his folk in their war against Sauron. But the Company that I journeyed with had other business. Of that I cannot speak now. Gandalf the Grey was our leader.'\n\n'Gandalf!' Eomer exclaimed. 'Gandalf Greyhame is known in the Mark: but his name, I warn you, is no longer a password to the king's favour. He has been a guest in the land many times in the memory of men, coming as he will, after a season, or after many years. He is ever the herald of strange events: a bringer of evil, some now say.\n\n'Indeed since his last coming in the summer all things have gone amiss. At that time our trouble with Saruman began. Until then we counted Saruman our friend, but Gandalf came then and warned us that sudden war was preparing in Isengard. He said that he himself had been a prisoner in Orthanc and had hardly escaped, and he begged for help. But Theoden would not listen to him, and he went away. Speak not the name of Gandalf loudly in Theoden's ears! He is wroth. For Gandalf took the horse that is called Shadowfax, the most precious of all the king's steeds, chief of the Mearas, which only the Lord of the Mark may ride. For the sire of their race was the great horse of Eorl that knew the speech of Men. Seven nights ago Shadowfax returned; but the king's anger is not less, for now the horse is wild and will let no man handle him.'\n\n'Then Shadowfax has found his way alone from the far North,' said Aragorn; 'for it was there that he and Gandalf parted. But alas! Gandalf will ride no longer. He fell into darkness in the Mines of Moria and comes not again.'\n\n'That is heavy tidings,' said Eomer. 'At least to me, and to many; though not to all, as you may find, if you come to the king.'\n\n'It is tidings more grievous than any in this land can understand, though it may touch them sorely ere the year is much older,' said Aragorn. 'But when the great fall, the less must lead. My part it has been to guide our Company on the long road from Moria. Through Lorien we came \u0426 of which it were well that you should learn the truth ere you speak of it again \u0426 and thence down the leagues of the Great River to the falls of Rauros. There Boromir was slain by the same Orcs whom you destroyed.'\n\n'Your news is all of woe!' cried Eomer in dismay. 'Great harm is this death to Minas Tirith, and to us all. That was a worthy man! All spoke his praise. He came seldom to the Mark, for he was ever in the wars on the East-borders; but I have seen him. More like to the swift sons of Eorl than to the grave Men of Gondor he seemed to me, and likely to prove a great captain of his people when his time came. But we have had no word of this grief out of Gondor. When did he fall?'\n\n'It is now the fourth day since he was slain,' answered Aragorn, 'and since the evening of that day we have journeyed from the shadow of Tol Brandir.'\n\n'On foot?' cried Eomer.\n\n'Yes, even as you see us.'\n\nWide wonder came into Eomer's eyes. 'Strider is too poor a name, son of Arathorn,' he said. 'Wingfoot I name you. This deed of the three friends should be sung in many a hall. Forty leagues and five you have measured ere the fourth day is ended! Hardy is the race of Elendil!\n\n'But now, lord, what would you have me do! I must return in haste to Theoden. I spoke warily before my men. It is true that we are not yet at open war with the Black Land, and there are some, close to the king's ear, that speak craven counsels; but war is coming. We shall not forsake our old alliance with Gondor, and while they fight we shall aid them: so say I and all who hold with me. The East-mark is my charge, the ward of the Third Marshal, and I have removed all our herds and herdfolk, withdrawing them beyond Entwash, and leaving none here but guards and swift scouts.'\n\n'Then you do not pay tribute to Sauron?' said Gimli.\n\n'We do not and we never have,' said Eomer with a flash of his eyes, 'though it comes to my ears that that lie has been told. Some years ago the Lord of the Black Land wished to purchase horses of us at great price, but we refused him, for he puts beasts to evil use. Then he sent plundering Orcs, and they carry off what they can, choosing always the black horses: few of these are now left. For that reason our feud with the Orcs is bitter.\n\n'But at this time our chief concern is with Saruman. He has claimed lordship over all this land, and there has been war between us for many months. He has taken Orcs into his service, and Wolf-riders, and evil Men, and he has closed the Gap against us, so that we are likely to be beset both east and west.\n\n'It is ill dealing with such a foe: he is a wizard both cunning and dwimmer-crafty, having many guises. He walks here and there, they say, as an old man hooded and cloaked, very like to Gandalf, as many now recall. His spies slip through every net, and his birds of ill omen are abroad in the sky. I do not know how it will all end, and my heart misgives me; for it seems to me that his friends do not all dwell in Isengard. But if you come to the king's house, you shall see for yourself. Will you not come? Do I hope in vain that you have been sent to me for a help in doubt and need?'\n\n'I will come when I may,' said Aragorn.\n\n'Come now!' said Eomer. 'The Heir of Elendil would be a strength indeed to the Sons of Eorl in this evil tide. There is battle even now upon the Westemnet, and I fear that it may go ill for us.\n\n'Indeed in this riding north I went without the king's leave, for in my absence his house is left with little guard. But scouts warned me of the orc-host coming down out of the East Wall three nights ago, and among them they reported that some bore the white badges of Saruman. So suspecting what I most fear, a league between Orthanc and the Dark Tower, I led forth my eored, men of my own household; and we overtook the Orcs at nightfall two days ago, near to the borders of the Entwood. There we surrounded them, and gave battle yesterday at dawn. Fifteen of my men I lost, and twelve horses alas! For the Orcs were greater in number than we counted on. Others joined them, coming out of the East across the Great River: their trail is plain to see a little north of this spot. And others, too, came out of the forest. Great Orcs, who also bore the White Hand of Isengard: that kind is stronger and more fell than all others.\n\n'Nonetheless we put an end to them. But we have been too long away. We are needed south and west. Will you not come? There are spare horses as you see. There is work for the Sword to do. Yes, and we could find a use for Gimli's axe and the bow of Legolas, if they will pardon my rash words concerning the Lady of the Wood. I spoke only as do all men in my land, and I would gladly learn better.'\n\n'I thank you for your fair words,' said Aragorn, 'and my heart desires to come with you; but I cannot desert my friends while hope remains.'\n\n'Hope does not remain,' said Eomer. 'You will not find your friends on the North-borders.'\n\n'Yet my friends are not behind. We found a clear token not far from the East Wall that one at least of them was still alive there. But between the wall and the downs we have found no other trace of them, and no trail has turned aside, this way or that, unless my skill has wholly left me.'\n\n'Then what do you think has become of them?'\n\n'I do not know. They may have been slain and burned among the Orcs; but that you will say cannot be, and I do not fear it. I can only think that they were carried off into the forest before the battle, even before you encircled your foes, maybe. Can you swear that none escaped your net in such a way?'\n\n'I would swear that no Orc escaped after we sighted them,' said Eomer. 'We reached the forest-eaves before them, and if after that any living thing broke through our ring, then it was no Orc and had some elvish power.'\n\n'Our friends were attired even as we are,' said Aragorn; 'and you passed us by under the full light of day.'\n\n'I had forgotten that,' said Eomer. 'It is hard to be sure of anything among so many marvels. The world is all grown strange. Elf and Dwarf in company walk in our daily fields; and folk speak with the Lady of the Wood and yet live; and the Sword comes back to war that was broken in the long ages ere the fathers of our fathers rode into the Mark! How shall a man judge what to do in such times?'\n\n'As he ever has judged,' said Aragorn. 'Good and ill have not changed since yesteryear; nor are they one thing among Elves and Dwarves, and another among Men. It is a man's part to discern them, as much in the Golden Wood as in his own house.'\n\n'True indeed,' said Eomer. 'But I do not doubt you, nor the deed which my heart would do. Yet I am not free to do all as I would. It is against our law to let strangers wander at will in our land, until the king himself shall give them leave, and more strict is the command in these days of peril. I have begged you to come back willingly with me, and you will not. Loth am I to begin a battle of one hundred against three.'\n\n'I do not think your law was made for such a chance,' said Aragorn. 'Nor indeed am I a stranger; for I have been in this land before, more than once, and ridden with the host of the Rohirrim, though under other name and in other guise. You I have not seen before, for you are young, but I have spoken with Eomund your father, and with Theoden son of Thengel. Never in former days would any high lord of this land have constrained a man to abandon such a quest as mine. My duty at least is clear, to go on. Come now, son of Eomund, the choice must be made at last. Aid us, or at the worst let us go free. Or seek to carry out your law. If you do so there will be fewer to return to your war or to your king.'\n\nEomer was silent for a moment, then he spoke. 'We both have need of haste,' he said. 'My company chafes to be away, and every hour lessens your hope. This is my choice. You may go; and what is more, I will lend you horses. This only I ask: when your quest is achieved, or is proved vain, return with the horses over the Entwade to Meduseld, the high house in Edoras where Theoden now sits. Thus you shall prove to him that I have not misjudged. In this I place myself, and maybe my very life, in the keeping of your good faith. Do not fail.'\n\n'I will not,' said Aragorn.\n\nThere was great wonder, and many dark and doubtful glances, among his men, when Eomer gave orders that the spare horses were to be lent to the strangers; but only Eothain dared to speak openly.\n\n'It may be well enough for this lord of the race of Gondor, as he claims,' he said, 'but who has heard of a horse of the Mark being given to a Dwarf?'\n\n'No one,' said Gimli. 'And do not trouble: no one will ever hear of it. I would sooner walk than sit on the back of any beast so great, free or begrudged.'\n\n'But you must ride now, or you will hinder us,' said Aragorn.\n\n'Come, you shall sit behind me, friend Gimli, said Legolas. Then all will be well, and you need neither borrow a horse nor be troubled by one.'\n\nA great dark-grey horse was brought to Aragorn, and he mounted it. 'Hasufel is his name,' said Eomer. 'May he bear you well and to better fortune than Garulf, his late master!'\n\nA smaller and lighter horse, but restive and fiery, was brought to Legolas. Arod was his name. But Legolas asked them to take off saddle and rein. 'I need them not,' he said, and leaped lightly up, and to their wonder Arod was tame and willing beneath him, moving here and there with but a spoken word: such was the elvish way with all good beasts. Gimli was lifted up behind his friend, and he clung to him, not much more at ease than Sam Gamgee in a boat.\n\n'Farewell, and may you find what you seek!' cried Eomer. 'Return with what speed you may, and let our swords hereafter shine together!'\n\n'I will come,' said Aragorn.\n\n'And I will come, too,' said Gimli. 'The matter of the Lady Galadriel lies still between us. I have yet to teach you gentle speech. '\n\n'We shall see,' said Eomer. 'So many strange things have chanced that to learn the praise of a fair lady under the loving strokes of a Dwarf's axe will seem no great wonder. Farewell!'\n\nWith that they parted. Very swift were the horses of Rohan. When after a little Gimli looked back, the company of Eomer were already small and far away. Aragorn did not look back: he was watching the trail as they sped on their way, bending low with his head beside the neck of Hasufel. Before long they came to the borders of the Entwash, and there they met the other trail of which Eomer had spoken, coming down from the East out of the Wold.\n\nAragorn dismounted and surveyed the ground, then leaping back into the saddle, he rode away for some distance eastward, keeping to one side and taking care not to override the footprints. Then he again dismounted and examined the ground, going backwards and forwards on foot.\n\n'There is little to discover,' he said when he returned. 'The main trail is all confused with the passage of the horsemen as they came back; their outward course must have lain nearer the river. But this eastward trail is fresh and clear. There is no sign there of any feet going the other way, back towards Anduin. Now we must ride slower, and make sure that no trace or footstep branches off on either side. The Orcs must have been aware from this point that they were pursued; they may have made some attempt to get their captives away before they were overtaken.'\n\nAs they rode forward the day was overcast. Low grey clouds came over the Wold. A mist shrouded the sun. Ever nearer the tree-clad slopes of Fangorn loomed, slowly darkling as the sun went west. They saw no sign of any trail to right or left, but here and there they passed single Orcs, fallen in their tracks as they ran, with grey-feathered arrows sticking in back or throat.\n\nAt last as the afternoon was waning they came to the eaves of the forest, and in an open glade among the first trees they found the place of the great burning: the ashes were still hot and smoking. Beside it was a great pile of helms and mail, cloven shields, and broken swords, bows and darts and other gear of war. Upon a stake in the middle was set a great goblin head; upon its shattered helm the white badge could still be seen. Further away, not far from the river, where it came streaming out from the edge of the wood, there was a mound. It was newly raised: the raw earth was covered with fresh-cut turves: about it were planted fifteen spears.\n\nAragorn and his companions searched far and wide about the field of battle, but the light faded, and evening soon drew down, dim and misty. By nightfall they had discovered no trace of Merry and Pippin.\n\n'We can do no more,' said Gimli sadly. 'We have been set many riddles since we came to Tol Brandir, but this is the hardest to unravel. I would guess that the burned bones of the hobbits are now mingled with the Orcs'. It will be hard news for Frodo, if he lives to hear it; and hard too for the old hobbit who waits in Rivendell. Elrond was against their coming.'\n\n'But Gandalf was not,' said Legolas.\n\n'But Gandalf chose to come himself, and he was the first to be lost,' answered Gimli. 'His foresight failed him.'\n\n'The counsel of Gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge of safety, for himself or for others,' said Aragorn. 'There are some things that it is better to begin than to refuse, even though the end may be dark. But I shall not depart from this place yet. In any case we must here await the morning-light.'\n\nA little way beyond the battle-field they made their camp under a spreading tree: it looked like a chestnut, and yet it still bore many broad brown leaves of a former year, like dry hands with long splayed fingers; they rattled mournfully in the night-breeze.\n\nGimli shivered. They had brought only one blanket apiece. 'Let us light a fire,' he said. 'I care no longer for the danger. Let the Orcs come as thick as summer-moths round a candle!'\n\n'If those unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods, it might draw them hither,' said Legolas.\n\n'And it might draw other things, neither Orc nor Hobbit,' said Aragorn. 'We are near to the mountain-marches of the traitor Saruman. Also we are on the very edge of Fangorn, and it is perilous to touch the trees of that wood, it is said.'\n\n'But the Rohirrim made a great burning here yesterday,' said Gimli, 'and they felled trees for the fire, as can be seen. Yet they passed the night after safely here, when their labour was ended.'\n\n'They were many,' said Aragorn, 'and they do not heed the wrath of Fangorn, for they come here seldom, and they do not go under the trees. But our paths are likely to lead us into the very forest itself. So have a care! Cut no living wood!'\n\n'There is no need,' said Gimli. 'The Riders have left chip and bough enough, and there is dead wood lying in plenty.' He went off to gather fuel, and busied himself with building and kindling a fire; but Aragorn sat silent with his back to the great tree, deep in thought; and Legolas stood alone in the open, looking towards the profound shadow of the wood, leaning forward, as one who listens to voices calling from a distance.\n\nWhen the Dwarf had a small bright blaze going, the three companions drew close to it and sat together, shrouding the light with their hooded forms. Legolas looked up at the boughs of the tree reaching out above them.\n\n'Look!' he said. 'The tree is glad of the fire!'\n\nIt may have been that the dancing shadows tricked their eyes, but certainly to each of the companions the boughs appeared to be bending this way and that so as to come above the flames, while the upper branches were stooping down; the brown leaves now stood out stiff, and rubbed together like many cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth.\n\nThere was a silence, for suddenly the dark and unknown forest, so near at hand, made itself felt as a great brooding presence, full of secret purpose. After a while Legolas spoke again.\n\n'Celeborn warned us not to go far into Fangorn,' he said. 'Do you know why, Aragorn? What are the fables of the forest that Boromir had heard?'\n\n'I have heard many tales in Gondor and elsewhere,' said Aragorn, 'but if it were not for the words of Celeborn I should deem them only fables that Men have made as true knowledge fades. I had thought of asking you what was the truth of the matter. And if an Elf of the Wood does not know, how shall a Man answer?'\n\n'You have journeyed further than I,' said Legolas. 'I have heard nothing of this in my own land, save only songs that tell how the Onodrim, that Men call Ents, dwelt there long ago; for Fangorn is old, old even as the Elves would reckon it.'\n\n'Yes, it is old,' said Aragorn, 'as old as the forest by the Barrow-downs, and it is far greater. Elrond says that the two are akin, the last strongholds of the mighty woods of the Elder Days, in which the Firstborn roamed while Men still slept. Yet Fangorn holds some secret of its own. What it is I do not know.'\n\n'And I do not wish to know,' said Gimli. 'Let nothing that dwells in Fangorn be troubled on my account!'\n\nThey now drew lots for the watches, and the lot for the first watch fell to Gimli. The others lay down. Almost at once sleep laid hold on them. 'Gimli!' said Aragorn drowsily. 'Remember, it is perilous to cut bough or twig from a living tree in Fangorn. But do not stray far in search of dead wood. Let the fire die rather! Call me at need!'\n\nWith that he fell asleep. Legolas already lay motionless, his fair hands folded upon his breast, his eyes unclosed, blending living night and deep dream, as is the way with Elves. Gimli sat hunched by the fire, running his thumb thoughtfully along the edge of his axe. The tree rustled. There was no other sound.\n\nSuddenly Gimli looked up, and there just on the edge of the fire-light stood an old bent man, leaning on a staff, and wrapped in a great cloak; his wide-brimmed hat was pulled down over his eyes. Gimli sprang up, too amazed for the moment to cry out, though at once the thought flashed into his mind that Saruman had caught them. Both Aragorn and Legolas, roused by his sudden movement, sat up and stared. The old man did not speak or make, sign.\n\n'Well, father, what can we do for you?' said Aragorn, leaping to his feet. 'Come and be warm, if you are cold!' He strode forward, but the old man was gone. There was no trace of him to be found near at hand, and they did not dare to wander far. The moon had set and the night was very dark.\n\nSuddenly Legolas gave a cry. 'The horses! The horses!'\n\nThe horses were gone. They had dragged their pickets and disappeared. For me time the three companions stood still and silent, troubled by this new stroke of ill fortune. They were under the eaves of Fangorn, and endless leagues lay between them and the Men of Rohan, their only friends in this wide and dangerous land. As they stood, it seemed to them that they heard, far off in the night, the sound of horses whinnying and neighing. Then all was quiet again, except for the cold rustle of the wind.\n\n'Well, they are gone,' said Aragorn at last. 'We cannot find them or catch them; so that if they do not return of their own will, we must do without. We started on our feet, and we have those still.'\n\n'Feet!' said Gimli. 'But we cannot eat them as well as walk on them,' He threw some fuel on the fire and slumped down beside it.\n\n'Only a few hours ago you were unwilling to sit on a horse of Rohan,' laughed Legolas. 'You will make a rider yet.'\n\n'It seems unlikely that I shall have the chance,' said Gimli.\n\n'If you wish to know what I think,' he began again after a while 'I think it was Saruman. Who else? Remember the words of Eomer: he walks about like an old man hooded and cloaked. Those were the words. He has gone off with our horses, or scared them away, and here we are. There is more trouble coming to us, mark my words!'\n\n'I mark them,' said Aragorn. 'But I marked also that this old man had a hat not a hood. Still I do not doubt that you guess right, and that we are in peril here, by night or day. Yet in the meantime there is nothing that we can do but rest, while we may. I will watch for a while now, Gimli. I have more need of thought than of sleep.'\n\nThe night passed slowly. Legolas followed Aragorn, and Gimli followed Legolas, and their watches wore away. But nothing happened. The old man did not appear again, and the horses did not return.\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Uruk-Hai\n\nPippin lay in a dark and troubled dream: it seemed that he could hear his own small voice echoing in black tunnels, calling Frodo, Frodo! But instead of Frodo hundreds of hideous orc-faces grinned at him out of the shadows, hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from every side. Where was Merry?\n\nHe woke. Cold air blew on his face. He was lying on his back. Evening was coming and the sky above was growing dim. He turned and found that the dream was little worse than the waking. His wrists, legs, and ankles were tied with cords. Beside him Merry lay, white-faced, with a dirty rag bound across his brows. All about them sat or stood a great company of Orcs.\n\nSlowly in Pippin's aching head memory pieced itself together and became separated from dream-shadows. Of course: he and Merry had run off into the woods. What had come over them? Why had they dashed off like that, taking no notice of old Strider? They had run a long way shouting \u0426 he could not remember how far or how long; and then suddenly they had crashed right into a group of Orcs: they were standing listening, and they did not appear to see Merry and Pippin until they were almost in their arms. Then they yelled and dozens of other goblins had sprung out of the trees. Merry and he had drawn their swords, but the Orcs did not wish to fight, and had tried only to lay hold of them, even when Merry had cut off several of their arms and hands. Good old Merry!\n\nThen Boromir had come leaping through the trees. He had made them fight. He slew many of them and the rest fled. But they had not gone far on the way back when they were attacked again. by a hundred Orcs at least, some of them very large, and they shot a rain of arrows: always at Boromir. Boromir had blown his great horn till the woods rang, and at first the Orcs had been dismayed and had drawn back; but when no answer but the echoes came, they had attacked more fierce than ever. Pippin did not remember much more. His last memo was of Boromir leaning against a tree, plucking out an arrow; then darkness fell suddenly.\n\n'I suppose I was knocked on the head,' he said to himself. 'I wonder if poor Merry is much hurt. What has happened to Boromir? Why didn't the Orcs kill us? Where are we, and where are we going?'\n\nHe could not answer the questions. He felt cold and sick. 'I wish Gandalf had never persuaded Elrond to let us come,' he thought. 'What good have I been? Just a nuisance: a passenger, a piece of luggage. And now I have been stolen and I am just a piece of luggage for the Orcs. I hope Strider or someone will come and claim us! But ought I to hope for it? Won't that throw out all the plans? I wish I could get free!'\n\nHe struggled a little, quite uselessly. One of the Orcs sitting near laughed and said something to a companion in their abominable tongue. 'Rest while you can, little fool!' he said then to Pippin, in the Common Speech, which he made almost as hideous as his own language. 'Rest while you can! We'll find a use for your legs before long. You'll wish you had got none before we get home.'\n\n'If I had my way, you'd wish you were dead now,' said the other. 'I'd make you squeak, you miserable rat.' He stooped over Pippin bringing his yellow fangs close to his face. He had a black knife with a long jagged blade in his hand. 'Lie quiet, or I'll tickle you with this,' he hissed. 'Don't draw attention to yourself, or I may forget my orders. Curse the Isengarders! Ugluk u bagronk sha pushdug Saruman-glob bubhosh skai': he passed into a long angry speech in his own tongue that slowly died away into muttering and snarling.\n\nTerrified Pippin lay still, though the pain at his wrists and ankles was growing, and the stones beneath him were boring into his back. To take his mind off himself he listened intently to all that he could hear. There were many voices round about, and though orc-speech sounded at all times full of hate and anger, it seemed plain that something like a quarrel had begun, and was getting hotter.\n\nTo Pippin's surprise he found that much of the talk was intelligible many of the Orcs were using ordinary language. Apparently the members of two or three quite different tribes were present, and they could not understand one another's orc-speech. There was an angry debate concerning what they were to do now: which way they were to take and what should be done with the prisoners.\n\n'There's no time to kill them properly,' said one. 'No time for play on this trip.'\n\n'That can't be helped,' said another. 'But why not kill them quick, kill them now? They're a cursed nuisance, and we're in a hurry. Evening's coming on, and we ought to get a move on.'\n\n'Orders.' said a third voice in a deep growl. 'Kill all but not the Halfings; they are to be brought back alive as quickly as possible. That's my orders.'\n\n'What are they wanted for?' asked several voices. 'Why alive? Do they give good sport?'\n\n'No! I heard that one of them has got something, something that's wanted for the War, some elvish plot or other. Anyway they'll both be questioned.'\n\n'Is that all you know? Why don't we search them and find out? We might find something that we could use ourselves.'\n\n'That is a very interesting remark,' sneered a voice, softer than the others but more evil. 'I may have to report that. The prisoners are not to be searched or plundered: those are my orders.'\n\n'And mine too,' said the deep voice. 'Alive and as captured; no spoiling. That's my orders.'\n\n'Not our orders!' said one of the earlier voices. 'We have come all the way from the Mines to kill, and avenge our folk. I wish to kill, and then go back north.'\n\n'Then you can wish again,' said the growling voice. 'I am Ugluk. I command. I return to Isengard by the shortest road.'\n\n'Is Saruman the master or the Great Eye?' said the evil voice. 'We should go back at once to Lugburz.'\n\n'If we could cross the Great River, we might,' said another voice. 'But there are not enough of us to venture down to the bridges.'\n\n'I came across,' said the evil voice. 'A winged Nazgul awaits us northward on the east-bank.'\n\n'Maybe, maybe! Then you'll fly off with our prisoners, and get all the pay and praise in Lugburz, and leave us to foot it as best we can through the Horse-country. No, we must stick together. These lands are dangerous: full of foul rebels and brigands.'\n\n'Aye, we must stick together,' growled Ugluk. 'I don't trust you little swine. You've no guts outside your own sties. But for us you'd all have run away. We are the fighting Uruk-hai! We slew the great warrior. We took the prisoners. We are the servants of Saruman the Wise, the White Hand: the Hand that gives us man's-flesh to eat. We came out of Isengard, and led you here, and we shall lead you back by the way we choose. I am Ugluk. I have spoken.'\n\n'You have spoken more than enough, Ugluk,' sneered the evil voice. 'I wonder how they would like it in Lugburz. They might think that Ugluk's shoulders needed relieving of a swollen head. They might ask where his strange ideas came from. Did they come from Saruman, perhaps? Who does he think he is, setting up on his own with his filthy white badges? They might agree with me, with Grishnakh their trusted messenger; and I Grishnakh say this: Saruman is a fool, and a dirty treacherous fool. But the Great Eye is on him.\n\n'Swine is it? How do you folk like being called swine by the muck-rakers of a dirty little wizard? It's orc-flesh they eat, I'll warrant.'\n\nMany loud yells in orc-speech answered him, and the ringing clash of weapons being drawn. Cautiously Pippin rolled over, hoping to see what would happen. His guards had gone to join in the fray. In the twilight he saw a large black Orc, probably Ugluk, standing facing Grishnakh, a short crook-legged creature, very broad and with long arms that hung almost to the ground. Round them were many smaller goblins. Pippin supposed that these were the ones from the North. They had drawn their knives and swords, but hesitated to attack Ugluk.\n\nUgluk shouted, and a number of other Orcs of nearly his own size ran up. Then suddenly, without warning, Ugluk sprang forwards, and with two swift strokes swept the heads off two of his opponents. Grishnakh stepped aside and vanished into the shadows. The others gave way, and one stepped backwards and fell over Merry's prostrate form with a curse. Yet that probably saved his life, for Ugluk's followers leaped over him and cut down another with their broad-bladed swords. It was the yellow-fanged guard. His body fell right on top of Pippin, still clutching its long saw-edged knife.\n\n'Put up your weapons!' shouted Ugluk. 'And let's have no more nonsense! We go straight west from here, and down the stair. From there straight to the downs, then along the river to the forest. And we march day and night. That clear?'\n\n'Now,' thought Pippin, 'if only it takes that ugly fellow a little while to get his troop under control, I've got a chance.' A gleam of hope had come to him. The edge of the black knife had snicked his arm, and then slid down to his wrist. He felt the blood trickling on to his hand, but he also felt the cold touch of steel against his skin.\n\nThe Orcs were getting ready to march again, but some of the Northerners were still unwilling, and the Isengarders slew two more before the rest were cowed. There was much cursing and confusion. For the moment Pippin was unwatched. His legs were securely bound, but his arms were only tied about the wrists, and his hands were in front of him. He could move them both together, though the bonds were cruelly tight. He pushed the dead Orc to one side, then hardly daring to breathe, he drew the knot of the wrist-cord up and down against the blade of the knife. It was sharp and the dead hand held it fast. The cord was cut! Quickly Pippin took it in his fingers and knotted it again into a loose bracelet of two loops and slipped it over his hands. Then he lay very still.\n\n'Pick up those prisoners!' shouted Ugluk. 'Don't play any tricks with them! If they are not alive when we get back, someone else will die too.'\n\nAn Orc seized Pippin like a sack, put its head between his tied hands, grabbed his arms and dragged them down, until Pippin's face was crushed against its neck; then it jolted off with him. Another treated Merry in the same way. The Orc's clawlike hand gripped Pippin's arms like iron; the nails bit into him. He shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams.\n\nSuddenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again. It was early night, but the slim moon was already falling westward. They were on the edge of a cliff that seemed to look out over a sea of pale mist. There was a sound of water falling nearby.\n\n'The scouts have come back at last,' said an Orc close at hand.\n\n'Well, what did you discover?' growled the voice of Ugluk.\n\n'Only a single horseman, and he made off westwards. All's clear now.'\n\n'Now, I daresay. But how long? You fools! You should have shot him. He'll raise the alarm. The cursed horsebreeders will hear of us by morning. Now we'll have to leg it double quick.'\n\nA shadow bent over Pippin. It was Ugluk. 'Sit up!' said the Orc. 'My lads are tired of lugging you about. We have got to climb down and you must use your legs. Be helpful now. No crying out, no trying to escape. We have ways of paying for tricks that you won't like, though they won't spoil your usefulness for the Master.'\n\nHe cut the thongs round Pippin's legs and ankles, picked him up by his hair and stood him on his feet. Pippin fell down, and Ugluk dragged him up by his hair again. Several Orcs laughed. Ugluk thrust a flask between his teeth and poured some burning liquid down his throat: he felt a hot fierce glow flow through him. The pain in his legs and ankles vanished. He could stand.\n\n'Now for the other!' said Ugluk. Pippin saw him go to Merry, who was lying close by, and kick him. Merry groaned. Seizing him roughly Ugluk pulled him into a sitting position, and tore the bandage off his head. Then he smeared the wound with some dark stuff out of a small wooden box. Merry cried out and struggled wildly.\n\nThe Orcs clapped and hooted. 'Can't take his medicine,' they jeered. 'Doesn't know what's good for him. Ai! We shall have some fun later.'\n\nBut at the moment Ugluk was not engaged in sport. He needed speed and had to humour unwilling followers. He was healing Merry in orc-fashion; and his treatment worked swiftly. When he had forced a drink from his flask down the hobbit's throat, cut his leg-bonds, and dragged him to his feet, Merry stood up, looking pale but grim and defiant, and very much alive. The gash in his forehead gave him no more trouble, but he bore a brown scar to the end of his days.\n\n'Hullo, Pippin!' he said. 'So you've come on this little expedition, too? Where do we get bed and breakfast?'\n\n'Now then!' said Ugluk. 'None of that! Hold your tongues. No talk to one another. Any trouble will be reported at the other end, and He'll know how to pay you. You'll get bed and breakfast all right: more than you can stomach.'\n\nThe orc-band began to descend a narrow ravine leading down into the misty plain below. Merry and Pippin, separated by a dozen Orcs or more, climbed down with them. At the bottom they stepped on to grass, and the hearts of the hobbits rose.\n\n'Now straight on!' shouted Ugluk. 'West and a little north. Follow Lugdush.'\n\n'But what are we going to do at sunrise?' said some of the Northerners.\n\n'Go on running,' said Ugluk. 'What do you think? Sit on the grass and wait for the Whiteskins to join the picnic?'\n\n'But we can't run in the sunlight.'\n\n'You'll run with me behind you,' said Ugluk. 'Run! Or you'll never see your beloved holes again. By the White Hand! What's the use of sending out mountain-maggots on a trip, only half trained. Run, curse you! Run while night lasts!'\n\nThen the whole company began to run with the long loping strides of Orcs. They kept no order, thrusting, jostling, and cursing; yet their speed was very great. Each hobbit had a guard of three. Pippin was far back in the line. He wondered how long he would be able to go on at this pace: he had had no food since the morning. One of his guards had a whip. But at present the orc-liquor was still hot in him. His wits, too, were wide awake.\n\nEvery now and again there came into his mind unbidden a vision of the keen face of Strider bending over a dark trail, and running, running behind. But what could even a Ranger see except a confused trail of orc-feet? His own little prints and Merry's were overwhelmed by the trampling of the iron-shod shoes before them and behind them and about them.\n\nThey had gone only a mile or so from the cliff when the land sloped down into a wide shallow depression, where the ground was soft and wet. Mist lay there, pale-glimmering in the last rays of the sickle moon. The dark shapes of the Orcs in front grew dim, and then were swallowed up.\n\n'Ai! Steady now!' shouted Ugluk from the rear.\n\nA sudden thought leaped into Pippin's mind, and he acted on it at once. He swerved aside to the right, and dived out of the reach of his clutching guard, headfirst into the mist; he landed sprawling on the grass.\n\n'Halt!' yelled Ugluk.\n\nThere was for a moment turmoil and confusion. Pippin sprang up and ran. But the Orcs were after him. Some suddenly loomed up right in front of him.\n\n'No hope of escape!' thought Pippin. 'But there is a hope that I have left some of my own marks unspoilt on the wet ground.' He groped with his two tied hands at his throat, and unclasped the brooch of his cloak. Just as long arms and hard claws seized him, he let it fall. 'There I suppose it will lie until the end of time,' he thought. 'I don't know why I did it. If the others have escaped, they've probably all gone with Frodo.'\n\nA whip-thong curled round his legs, and he stifled a cry.\n\n'Enough!' shouted Ugluk running up. 'He's still got to run a long way yet. Make 'em both run! Just use the whip as a reminder.'\n\n'But that's not all,' he snarled, turning to Pippin. 'I shan't forget. Payment is only put off. Leg it!'\n\nNeither Pippin nor Merry remembered much of the later part of the journey. Evil dreams and evil waking were blended into a long tunnel of misery, with hope growing ever fainter behind. They ran, and they ran, striving to keep up the pace set by the Orcs, licked every now and again with a cruel thong cunningly handled. If they halted or stumbled, they were seized and dragged for some distance.\n\nThe warmth of the orc-draught had gone. Pippin felt cold and sick again. Suddenly he fell face downward on the turf. Hard hands with rending nails gripped and lifted him. He was carried like a sack once more, and darkness grew about him: whether the darkness of another night, or a blindness of his eyes, he could not tell.\n\nDimly he became aware of voices clamouring: it seemed that many of the Orcs were demanding a halt. Ugluk was shouting. He felt himself flung to the ground, and he lay as he fell, till black dreams took him. But he did not long escape from pain; soon the iron grip of merciless hands was on him again. For a long time he was tossed and shaken, and then slowly the darkness gave way, and he came back to the waking world and found that it was morning. Orders were shouted and he was thrown roughly on the grass.\n\nThere he lay for a while, fighting with despair. His head swam, but from the heat in his body he guessed that he had been given another draught. An Orc stooped over him, and flung him some bread and a strip of raw dried flesh. He ate the stale grey bread hungrily, but not the meat. He was famished but not yet so famished as to eat flesh flung to him by an Orc, the flesh of he dared not guess what creature.\n\nHe sat up and looked about. Merry was not far away. They were by the banks of a swift narrow river. Ahead mountains loomed: a tall peak was catching the first rays of the sun. A dark smudge of forest lay on the lower slopes before them.\n\nThere was much shouting and debating among the Orcs; a quarrel seemed on the point of breaking out again between the Northerners and the Isengarders. Some were pointing back away south, and some were pointing eastward.\n\n'Very well,' said Ugluk. 'Leave them to me then! No killing, as I've told you before; but if you want to throw away what we've come all the way to get, throw it away! I'll look after it. Let the fighting Uruk-hai do the work, as usual. If you're afraid of the Whiteskins, run! Run! There's the forest,' he shouted, pointing ahead. 'Get to it! It's your best hope. Off you go! And quick, before I knock a few more heads off, to put some sense into the others.'\n\nThere was some cursing and scuffling, and then most of the Northerners broke away and dashed off, over a hundred of them, running wildly along the river towards the mountains. The hobbits were left with the Isengarders: a grim dark band, four score at least of large, swart, slant-eyed Orcs with great bows and short broad-bladed swords. A few of the larger and bolder Northerners remained with them.\n\n'Now we'll deal with Grishnakh,' said Ugluk; but some even of his own followers were looking uneasily southwards.\n\n'I know,' growled Ugluk. 'The cursed horse-boys have got wind of us. But that's all your fault, Snaga. You and the other scouts ought to have your ears cut off. But we are the fighters. We'll feast on horseflesh yet, or something better.'\n\nAt that moment Pippin saw why some of the troop had been pointing eastward. From that direction there now came hoarse cries, and there was Grishnakh again, and at his back a couple of score of others like him: long-armed crook-legged Orcs. They had a red eye painted on their shields. Ugluk stepped forward to meet them. 'So you've come back?' he said. 'Thought better of it, eh?'\n\n'I've returned to see that Orders are carried out and the prisoners safe,' answered Grishnakh.\n\n'Indeed!' said Ugluk. 'Waste of effort. I'll see that orders are carried out in my command. And what else did you come back for? You went in a hurry. Did you leave anything behind?'\n\n'I left a fool,' snarled Grishnakh. 'But there were some stout fellows with him that are too good to lose. I knew you'd lead them into a mess. I've come to help them.'\n\n'Splendid!' laughed Ugluk. 'But unless you've got some guts for fighting, you've taken the wrong way. Lugburz was your road. The Whiteskins are coming. What's happened to your precious Nazgul? Has he had another mount shot under him? Now, if you'd brought him along, that might have been useful \u0426 if these Nazgul are all they make out.'\n\n'Nazgul, Nazgul,' said Grishnakh, shivering and licking his lips, as if the word had a foul taste that he savoured painfully. 'You speak of what is deep beyond the reach of your muddy dreams, Ugluk,' he said. 'Nazgul! Ah! All that they make out! One day you'll wish that you had not said that. Ape!' he snarled fiercely. 'You ought to know that they're the apple of the Great Eye. But the winged Nazgul: not yet, not yet. He won't let them show themselves across the Great River yet, not too soon. They're for the War \u0426 and other purposes.'\n\n'You seem to know a lot,' said Ugluk. 'More than is good for you, I guess. Perhaps those in Lugburz might wonder how, and why. But in the meantime the Uruk-hai of Isengard can do the dirty work, as usual. Don't stand slavering there! Get your rabble together! The other swine are legging it to the forest. You'd better follow. You wouldn't get back to the Great River alive. Right off the mark! Now! I'll be on your heels.'\n\nThe Isengarders seized Merry and Pippin again and slung them on their backs. Then the troop started off. Hour after hour they ran, pausing now and again only to sling the hobbits to fresh carriers. Either because they were quicker and hardier, or because of some plan of Grishnakh's, the Isengarders gradually passed through the Orcs of Mordor, and Grishnakh's folk closed in behind. Soon they were gaining also on the Northerners ahead. The forest began to draw nearer.\n\nPippin was bruised and torn, his aching head was grated by the filthy jowl and hairy ear of the Orc that held him. Immediately in front were bowed backs, and tough thick legs going up and down, up and down, unresting, as if they were made of wire and horn, beating out the nightmare seconds of an endless time.\n\nIn the afternoon Ugluk's troop overtook the Northerners. They were flagging in the rays of the bright sun, winter sun shining in a pale cool sky though it was; their heads were down and their tongues lolling out.\n\n'Maggots!' jeered the Isengarders. 'You're cooked. The Whiteskins will catch you and eat you. They're coming!'\n\nA cry from Grishnakh showed that this was not mere jest. Horsemen, riding very swiftly, had indeed been sighted: still far behind, but gaining on the Orcs, gaining on them like a tide over the flats on folk straying in a quicksand.\n\nThe Isengarders began to run with a redoubled pace that astonished Pippin, a terrific spurt it seemed for the end of a race. Then he saw that the sun was sinking, falling behind the Misty Mountains; shadows reached over the land. The soldiers of Mordor lifted their heads and also began to put on speed. The forest was dark and close. Already they had passed a few outlying trees. The land was beginning to slope upwards. ever more steeply; but the Orcs did not halt. Both Ugluk and Grishnakh shouted, spurring them on to a last effort.\n\n'They will make it yet. They will escape,' thought Pippin. And then he managed to twist his neck, so as to glance back with one eye over his shoulder. He saw that riders away eastward were already level with the Orcs, galloping over the plain. The sunset gilded their spears and helmets, and glinted in their pale flowing hair. They were hemming the Orcs in, preventing them from scattering, and driving them along the line of the river.\n\nHe wondered very much what kind of folk they were. He wished now that he had learned more in Rivendell, and looked more at maps and things; but in those days the plans for the journey seemed to be in more competent hands, and he had never reckoned with being cut off from Gandalf, or from Strider, and even from Frodo. All that he could remember about Rohan was that Gandalf's horse, Shadowfax, had come from that land. That sounded hopeful, as far as it went.\n\n'But how will they know that we are not Orcs?' he thought. 'I don't suppose they've ever heard of hobbits down here. I suppose I ought to be glad that the beastly Orcs look like being destroyed, but I would rather be saved myself.' The chances were that he and Merry would be killed together with their captors, before ever the Men of Rohan were aware of them.\n\nA few of the riders appeared to be bowmen, skilled at shooting from a running horse. Riding swiftly into range they shot arrows at the Orcs that straggled behind, and several of them fell; then the riders wheeled away out of the range of the answering bows of their enemies, who shot wildly, not daring to halt. This happened many times, and on one occasion arrows fell among the Isengarders. One of them, just in front of Pippin, stumbled and did not get up again.\n\nNight came down without the Riders closing in for battle. Many Orcs had fallen, but fully two hundred remained. In the early darkness the Orcs came to a hillock. The eaves of the forest were very near, probably no more than three furlongs away, but they could go no further. The horsemen had encircled them. A small band disobeyed Ugluk's command, and ran on towards the forest: only three returned.\n\n'Well, here we are,' sneered Grishnakh. 'Fine leadership! I hope the great Ugluk will lead us out again.'\n\n'Put those Halflings down!' ordered Ugluk, taking no notice of Grishnakh. 'You, Lugdush, get two others and stand guard over them! They're not to be killed, unless the filthy Whiteskins break through. Understand? As long as I'm alive, I want 'em. But they're not to cry out, and they're not to be rescued. Bind their legs!'\n\nThe last part of the order was carried out mercilessly. But Pippin found that for the first time he was close to Merry. The Orcs were making a great deal of noise, shouting and clashing their weapons, and the hobbits managed to whisper together for a while.\n\n'I don't think much of this,' said Merry. 'I feel nearly done in. Don't think I could crawl away far, even if I was free.'\n\n'Lembas!' whispered Pippin. 'Lembas: I've got some. Have you? I don't think they've taken anything but our swords.'\n\n'Yes, I had a packet in my pocket,' answered Merry, 'but it must be battered to crumbs. Anyway I can't put my mouth in my pocket!'\n\n'You won't have to. I've\u0427'; but just then a savage kick warned Pippin that the noise had died down, and the guards were watchful.\n\nThe night was cold and still. All round the knoll on which the Orcs were gathered little watch-fires sprang up, golden-red in the darkness, a complete ring of them. They were within a long bowshot, but the riders did not show themselves against the light, and the Orcs wasted many arrows shooting at the fires, until Ugluk stopped them. The riders made no sound. Later in the night when the moon came out of the mist, then occasionally they could be seen, shadowy shapes that glinted now and again in the white light, as they moved in ceaseless patrol.\n\n'They'll wait for the Sun, curse them!' growled one of the guards. 'Why don't we get together and charge through? What's old Ugluk think he's doing, I should like to know?'\n\n'I daresay you would,' snarled Ugluk stepping up from behind. 'Meaning I don't think at all, eh? Curse you! You're as bad as the other rabble: the maggots and the apes of Lugburz. No good trying to charge with them. They'd just squeal and bolt, and there are more than enough of these filthy horse-boys to mop up our lot on the flat.\n\n'There's only one thing those maggots can do: they can see like gimlets in the dark. But these Whiteskins have better night-eyes than most Men, from all I've heard; and don't forget their horses! They can see the night-breeze, or so it's said. Still there's one thing the fine fellows don't know: Mauhur and his lads are in the forest, and they should turn up any time now.'\n\nUgluk's words were enough, apparently, to satisfy the Isengarders; but the other Orcs were both dispirited and rebellious. They posted a few watchers, but most of them lay on the ground, resting in the pleasant darkness. It did indeed become very dark again; for the moon passed westward into thick cloud, and Pippin could not see anything a few feet away. The fires brought no light to the hillock. The riders were not, however, content merely to wait for the dawn and let their enemies rest. A sudden outcry on the east side of the knoll showed that something was wrong. It seemed that some of the Men had ridden in close, slipped off their horses, crawled to the edge of the camp and killed several Orcs, and then had faded away again. Ugluk dashed off to stop a stampede.\n\nPippin and Merry sat up. Their guards, Isengarders, had gone with Ugluk. But if the hobbits had any thought of escape, it was soon dashed. A long hairy arm took each of them by the neck and drew them close together. Dimly they were aware of Grishnakh's great head and hideous face between them; his foul breath was on their cheeks. He began to paw them and feel them. Pippin shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his back.\n\n'Well, my little ones!' said Grishnakh in a soft whisper. 'Enjoying your nice rest? Or not? A little awkwardly placed, perhaps: swords and whips on one side, and nasty spears on the other! Little people should not meddle in affairs that are too big for them.' His fingers continued to grope. There was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes.\n\nThe thought came suddenly into Pippin's mind, as if caught direct from the urgent thought of his enemy: 'Grishnakh knows about the Ring! He's looking for it, while Ugluk is busy: he probably wants it for himself.' Cold fear was in Pippin's heart, yet at the same time he was wondering what use he could make of Grishnakh's desire.\n\n'I don't think you will find it that way,' he whispered. 'It isn't easy to find.'\n\n'Find it?' said Grishnakh: his fingers stopped crawling and gripped Pippin's shoulder. 'Find what? What are you talking about, little one?'\n\nFor a moment Pippin was silent. Then suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in his throat: gollum, gollum. 'Nothing, my precious,' he added.\n\nThe hobbits felt Grishnakh's fingers twitch. 'O ho!' hissed the goblin softly. 'That's what he means, is it? O ho! Very ve-ry dangerous, my little ones.'\n\n'Perhaps,' said Merry, now alert and aware of Pippin's guess. 'Perhaps; and not only for us. Still you know your own business best. Do you want it, or not? And what would you give for it?'\n\n'Do I want it? Do I want it?' said Grishnakh, as if puzzled; but his arms were trembling. 'What would I give for it? What do you mean?'\n\n'We mean,' said Pippin, choosing his words carefully, 'that it's no good groping in the dark. We could save you time and trouble. But you must untie our legs first, or we'll do nothing, and say nothing.'\n\n'My dear tender little fools,' hissed Grishnakh, 'everything you have, and everything you know, will be got out of you in due time: everything! You'll wish there was more that you could tell to satisfy the Questioner, indeed you will: quite soon. We shan't hurry the enquiry. Oh dear no! What do you think you've been kept alive for? My dear little fellows, please believe me when I say that it was not out of kindness: that's not even one of Ugluk's faults.'\n\n'I find it quite easy to believe,' said Merry. 'But you haven't got your prey home yet. And it doesn't seem to be going your way, whatever happens. If we come to Isengard, it won't be the great Grishnakh that benefits: Saruman will take all that he can find. If you want anything for yourself, now's the time to do a deal.'\n\nGrishnakh began to lose his temper. The name of Saruman seemed specially to enrage him. Time was passing and the disturbance was dying down. Ugluk or the Isengarders might return at any minute.\n\n'Have you got it \u0426 either of you?' he snarled.\n\n'Gollum, gollum!' said Pippin.\n\n'Untie our legs!' said Merry.\n\nThey felt the Orc's arms trembling violently. 'Curse you, you filthy little vermin!' he hissed. 'Untie your legs? I'll untie every string in your bodies. Do you think I can't search you to the bones? Search you! I'll cut you both to quivering shreds. I don't need the help of your legs to get you away \u0426 and have you all to myself!'\n\nSuddenly he seized them. The strength in his long arms and shoulders was terrifying. He tucked them one under each armpit, and crushed them fiercely to his sides; a great stifling hand was clapped over each of their mouths. Then he sprang forward, stooping low. Quickly and silently he went, until he came to the edge of the knoll. There, choosing a gap between the watchers, he passed like an evil shadow out into the night, down the slope and away westward towards the river that flowed out of the forest. In that direction there was a wide open space with only one fire.\n\nAfter going a dozen yards he halted, peering and listening. Nothing could be seen or heard. He crept slowly on, bent almost double. Then he squatted and listened again. Then he stood up, as if to risk a sudden dash. At that very moment the dark form of a rider loomed up right in front of him. A horse snorted and reared. A man called out.\n\nGrishnakh flung himself on the ground flat, dragging the hobbits under him; then he drew his sword. No doubt he meant to kill his captives, rather than allow them to escape or to be rescued; but it was his undoing. The sword rang faintly, and glinted a little in the light of the fire away to his left. An arrow came whistling out of the gloom: it was aimed with skill, or guided by fate, and it pierced his right hand. He dropped the sword and shrieked. There was a quick beat of hoofs, and even as Grishnakh leaped up and ran, he was ridden down and a spear passed through him. He gave a hideous shivering cry and lay still.\n\nThe hobbits remained flat on the ground, as Grishnakh had left them. Another horseman came riding swiftly to his comrade's aid. Whether because of some special keenness of sight, or because of some other sense, the horse lifted and sprang lightly over them; but its rider did not see them, lying covered in their elven-cloaks, too crushed for the moment, and too afraid to move.\n\nAt last Merry stirred and whispered softly: 'So far so good: but how are we to avoid being spitted?'\n\nThe answer came almost immediately. The cries of Grishnakh had roused the Orcs. From the yells and screeches that came from the knoll the hobbits guessed that their disappearance had been discovered: Ugluk was probably knocking off a few more heads. Then suddenly the answering cries of orc-voices came from the right, outside the circle of watch-fires, from the direction of the forest and the mountains. Mauhur had apparently arrived and was attacking the besiegers. There was the sound of galloping horses. The Riders were drawing in their ring close round the knoll, risking the orc-arrows, so as to prevent any sortie, while a company rode off to deal with the newcomers. Suddenly Merry and Pippin realized that without moving they were now outside the circle: there was nothing between them and escape.\n\n'Now,' said Merry, 'if only we had our legs and hands free, we might get away. But I can't touch the knots, and I can't bite them.'\n\n'No need to try,' said Pippin. 'I was going to tell you: I've managed to free my hands. These loops are only left for show. You'd better have a bit of lembas first.'\n\nHe slipped the cords off his wrists, and fished out a packet. The cakes were broken, but good, still in their leaf-wrappings. The hobbits each ate two or three pieces. The taste brought back to them the memory of fair faces, and laughter, and wholesome food in quiet days now far away. For a while they ate thoughtfully, sitting in the dark, heedless of the cries and sounds of battle nearby. Pippin was the first to come back to the present.\n\n'We must be off,' he said. 'Half a moment!' Grishnakh's sword was lying close at hand, but it was too heavy and clumsy for him to use; so he crawled forward, and finding the body of the goblin he drew from its sheath a long sharp knife. With this he quickly cut their bonds.\n\n'Now for it!' he said. 'When we've warmed up a bit, perhaps we shall be able to stand again, and walk. But in any case we had better start by crawling.'\n\nThey crawled. The turf was deep and yielding, and that helped them: but it seemed a long slow business. They gave the watch-fire a wide berth, and wormed their way forward bit by bit, until they came to the edge of the river, gurgling away in the black shadows under its deep banks. Then they looked back.\n\nThe sounds had died away. Evidently Mauhur and his 'lads' had been killed or driven off. The Riders had returned to their silent ominous vigil. It would not last very much longer. Already the night was old. In the East, which had remained unclouded, the sky was beginning to grow pale.\n\n'We must get under cover,' said Pippin, 'or we shall be seen. It will not be any comfort to us, if these riders discover that we are not Orcs after we are dead.' He got up and stamped his feet. 'Those cords have cut me like wires; but my feet are getting warm again. I could stagger on now. What about you, Merry?'\n\nMerry got up. 'Yes,' he said, 'I can manage it. Lembas does put heart into you! A more wholesome sort of feeling, too, than the heat of that orc-draught. I wonder what it was made of. Better not to know, I expect. Let's get a drink of water to wash away the thought of it!'\n\n'Not here, the banks are too steep,' said Pippin. 'Forward now!'\n\nThey turned and walked side by side slowly along the line of the river. Behind them the light grew in the East. As they walked they compared notes, talking lightly in hobbit-fashion of the things that had happened since their capture. No listener would have guessed from their words that they had suffered cruelly, and been in dire peril, going without hope towards torment and death; or that even now, as they knew well, they had little chance of ever finding friend or safety again.\n\n'You seem to have been doing well, Master Took,' said Merry. 'You will get almost a chapter in old Bilbo's book, if ever I get a chance to report to him. Good work: especially guessing that hairy villain's little game, and playing up to him. But I wonder if anyone will ever pick up your trail and find that brooch. I should hate to lose mine, but I am afraid yours is gone for good.\n\n'I shall have to brush up my toes, if I am to get level with you. Indeed Cousin Brandybuck is going in front now. This is where he comes in. I don't suppose you have much notion where we are; but I spent my time at Rivendell rather better. We are walking west along the Entwash. The butt-end of the Misty Mountains is in front, and Fangorn Forest.'\n\nEven as he spoke the dark edge of the forest loomed up straight before them. Night seemed to have taken refuge under its great trees, creeping away from the coming Dawn.\n\n'Lead on, Master Brandybuck!' said Pippin. 'Or lead back! We have been warned against Fangorn. But one so knowing will not have forgotten that.'\n\n'I have not,' answered Merry; 'but the forest seems better to me, all the same, than turning back into the middle of a battle.'\n\nHe led the way in under the huge branches of the trees. Old beyond guessing, they seemed. Great trailing beards of lichen hung from them, blowing and swaying in the breeze. Out of the shadows the hobbits peeped, gazing back down the slope: little furtive figures that in the dim light looked like elf-children in the deeps of time peering out of the Wild Wood in wonder at their first Dawn.\n\nFar over the Great River, and the Brown Lands, leagues upon grey leagues away, the Dawn came, red as flame. Loud rang the hunting-horns to greet it. The Riders of Rohan sprang suddenly to life. Horn answered horn again.\n\nMerry and Pippin heard, clear in the cold air, the neighing of war-horses, and the sudden singing of many men. The Sun's limb was lifted, an arc of fire, above the margin of the world. Then with a great cry the Riders charged from the East; the red light gleamed on mail and spear. The Orcs yelled and shot all the arrows that remained to them. The hobbits saw several horsemen fall; but their line held on up the hill and over it, and wheeled round and charged again. Most of the raiders that were left alive then broke and fled, this way and that, pursued one by one to the death. But one band, holding together in a black wedge, drove forward resolutely in the direction of the forest. Straight up the slope they charged towards the watchers. Now they were drawing near, and it seemed certain that they would escape: they had already hewn down three Riders that barred their way.\n\n'We have watched too long,' said Merry. 'There's Ugluk! I don't want to meet him again.' The hobbits turned and fled deep into the shadows of the wood.\n\nSo it was that they did not see the last stand, when Ugluk was overtaken and brought to bay at the very edge of Fangorn. There he was slain at last by Eomer, the Third Marshal of the Mark, who dismounted and fought him sword to sword. And over the wide fields the keen-eyed Riders hunted down the few Orcs that had escaped and still had strength to fly.\n\nThen when they had laid their fallen comrades in a mound and had sung their praises, the Riders made a great fire and scattered the ashes of their enemies. So ended the raid, and no news of it came ever back either to Mordor or to Isengard; but the smoke of the burning rose high to heaven and was seen by many watchful eyes.\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nTreebeard\n\nMeanwhile the hobbits went with as much speed as the dark and tangled forest allowed, following the line of the running stream, westward and up towards the slopes of the mountains, deeper and deeper into Fangorn. Slowly their fear of the Orcs died away, and their pace slackened. A queer stifling feeling came over them, as if the air were too thin or too scanty for breathing.\n\nAt last Merry halted. 'We can't go on like this,' he panted. 'I want some air.'\n\n'Let's have a drink at any rate,' said Pippin. 'I'm parched.' He clambered on to a great tree-root that wound down into the stream, and stooping drew up some water in his cupped hands. It was clear and cold, and he took many draughts. Merry followed him. The water refreshed them and seemed to cheer their hearts; for a while they sat together on the brink of the stream, dabbling their sore feet and legs, and peering round at the trees that stood silently about them, rank upon rank, until they faded away into grey twilight in every direction.\n\n'I suppose you haven't lost us already?' said Pippin, leaning back against a great tree-trunk. 'We can at least follow the course of this stream, the Entwash or whatever you call it, and get out again the way we came.'\n\n'We could, if our legs would do it,' said Merry; 'and if we could breathe properly.'\n\n'Yes, it is all very dim, and stuffy, in here,' said Pippin. 'It reminds me, somehow, of the old room in the Great Place of the Tooks away back in the Smials at Tuckborough: a huge place, where the furniture has never been moved or changed for generations. They say the Old Took lived in it year after year, while he and the room got older and shabbier together \u0426 and it has never changed since he died, a century ago. And Old Gerontius was my great-great-grandfather: that puts it back a bit. But that is nothing to the old feeling of this wood. Look at all those weeping, trailing, beards and whiskers of lichen! And most of the trees seem to be half covered with ragged dry leaves that have never fallen. Untidy. I can't imagine what spring would look like here, if it ever comes; still less a spring-cleaning.'\n\n'But the Sun at any rate must peep in sometimes.' said Merry. 'It does not look or feel at all like Bilbo's description of Mirkwood. That was all dark and black, and the home of dark black things. This is just dim, and frightfully tree-ish. You can't imagine animals living here at all, or staying for long.'\n\n'No, nor hobbits,' said Pippin. 'And I don't like the thought of trying to get through it either. Nothing to eat for a hundred miles, I should guess. How are our supplies?'\n\n'Low,' said Merry. 'We ran off with nothing but a couple of spare packets of lembas, and left everything else behind.' They looked at what remained of the elven-cakes: broken fragments for about five meagre days, that was all. 'And not a wrap or a blanket,' said Merry. 'We shall be cold tonight, whichever way we go.'\n\n'Well, we'd better decide on the way now,' said Pippin. 'The morning must be getting on.'\n\nJust then they became aware of a yellow light that had appeared, some way further on into the wood: shafts of sunlight seemed suddenly to have pierced the forest-roof.\n\n'Hullo!' said Merry. 'The Sun must have run into a cloud while we've been under these trees, and now she has run out again; or else she has climbed high enough to look down through some opening. It isn't far \u0426 let's go and investigate!'\n\nThey found it was further than they thought. The ground was rising steeply still, and it was becoming increasingly stony. The light grew broader as they went on, and soon they saw that there was a rock-wall before them: the side of a hill, or the abrupt end of some long root thrust out by the distant mountains. No trees grew on it, and the sun was falling full on its stony face. The twigs of the trees at its foot were stretched out stiff and still, as if reaching out to the warmth. Where all had looked so shabby and grey before, the wood now gleamed with rich browns, and with the smooth black-greys of bark like polished leather. The boles of the trees glowed with a soft green like young grass: early spring or a fleeting vision of it was about them.\n\nIn the face of the stony wall there was something like a stair: natural perhaps, and made by the weathering and splitting of the rock, for it was rough and uneven. High up, almost level with the tops of forest-trees, there was a shelf under a cliff. Nothing grew there but a few grasses and weeds at its edge, and one old stump of a tree with only two bent branches left: it looked almost like the figure of some gnarled old man, standing there, blinking in the morning-light.\n\n'Up we go!' said Merry joyfully. 'Now for a breath of air, and a sight of the land!'\n\nThey climbed and scrambled up the rock. If the stair had been made it was for bigger feet and longer legs than theirs. They were too eager to be surprised at the remarkable way in which the cuts and sores of their captivity had healed and their vigour had returned. They came at length to the edge of the shelf almost at the feet of the old stump; then they sprang up and turned round with their backs to the hill, breathing deep, and looking out eastward. They saw that they had only come some three or four miles into the forest: the heads of the trees marched down the slopes towards the plain. There, near the fringe of the forest, tall spires of curling black smoke went up, wavering and floating towards them.\n\n'The wind's changing,' said Merry. 'It's turned east again. It feels cool up here.'\n\n'Yes,' said Pippin. 'I'm afraid this is only a passing gleam, and it will all go grey again. What a pity! This shaggy old forest looked so different in the sunlight. I almost felt I liked the place.'\n\n'Almost felt you liked the Forest! That's good! That's uncommonly kind of you,' said a strange voice. 'Turn round and let me have a look at your faces. I almost feel that I dislike you both, but do not let us be hasty. Turn round!' A large knob-knuckled hand was laid on each of their shoulders, and they were twisted round, gently but irresistibly; then two great arms lifted them up.\n\nThey found that they were looking at a most extraordinary face. It belonged to a large Man-like, almost Troll-like, figure, at least fourteen foot high, very sturdy, with a tall head, and hardly any neck. Whether it was clad in stuff like green and grey bark, or whether that was its hide, was difficult to say. At any rate the arms, at a short distance from the trunk, were not wrinkled, but covered with a brown smooth skin. The large feet had seven toes each. The lower part of the long face was covered with a sweeping grey beard, bushy, almost twiggy at the roots, thin and mossy at the ends. But at the moment the hobbits noted little but the eyes. These deep eyes were now surveying them, slow and solemn, but very penetrating. They were brown, shot with a green light. Often afterwards Pippin tried to describe his first impression of them.\n\n'One felt as if there was an enormous well behind them, filled up with ages of memory and long, slow, steady thinking; but their surface was sparkling with the present: like sun shimmering on the outer leaves of a vast tree, or on the ripples of a very deep lake. I don't know but it felt as if something that grew in the ground \u0426 asleep, you might say, or just feeling itself as something between roof-tip and leaf-tip, between deep earth and sky had suddenly waked up, and was considering you with the same slow care that it had given to its own inside affairs for endless years.'\n\n'Hrum, Hoom,' murmured the voice, a deep voice like a very deep woodwind instrument. 'Very odd indeed! Do not be hasty, that is my motto. But if I had seen you, before I heard your voices \u0426 I liked them: nice little voices; they reminded me of something I cannot remember \u0426 if I had seen you before I heard you, I should have just trodden on you, taking you for little Orcs, and found out my mistake afterwards. Very odd you are, indeed. Root and twig, very odd!'\n\nPippin, though still amazed, no longer felt afraid. Under those eyes he felt a curious suspense, but not fear. 'Please,' he said, 'who are you? And what are you?'\n\nA queer look came into the old eyes, a kind of wariness; the deep wells were covered over. 'Hrum, now,' answered the voice; 'well, I am an Ent, or that's what they call me. Yes, Ent is the word. The Ent, I am, you might say, in your manner of speaking. Fangorn is my name according to some, Treebeard others make it. Treebeard will do.'\n\n'An Ent?' said Merry. 'What's that? But what do you call yourself? What's your real name?'\n\n'Hoo now!' replied Treebeard. 'Hoo! Now that would be telling! Not so hasty. And I am doing the asking. You are in my country. What are you, I wonder? I cannot place you. You do not seem to come in the old lists that I learned when I was young. But that was a long, long time ago, and they may have made new lists. Let me see! Let me see! How did it go?\n\n\t\tLearn now the lore of Living Creatures!\n\t\tFirst name the four, the free peoples:\n\t\tEldest of all, the elf-children;\n\t\tDwarf the delver, dark are his houses;\n\t\tEnt the earthborn, old as mountains;\n\t\tMan the mortal, master of horses.\n\nHm, hm, hm.\n\n\t\tBeaver the builder, buck the leaper,\n\t\tBear bee-hunter, boar the fighter;\n\t\tHound is hungry, hare is fearful\u0415\n\nhm, hm.\n\n\t\tEagle in eyrie, ox in pasture,\n\t\tHart horn-crowned; hawk is swiftest\n\t\tSwan the whitest, serpent coldest\u0415\n\nHoom, hm; hoom, hm, how did it go? Room tum, room tum, roomty toom tum. It was a long list. But anyway you do not seem to fit in anywhere!'\n\n'We always seem to have got left out of the old lists, and the old stories,' said Merry. 'Yet we've been about for quite a long time. We're hobbits.'\n\n'Why not make a new line?' said Pippin.\n\n\t\t'Half-grown hobbits, the hole-dwellers.'\n\nPut us in amongst the four, next to Man (the Big People) and you've got it.'\n\n'Hm! Not bad, not bad,' said Treebeard. 'That would do. So you live in holes, eh? It sounds very right and proper. Who calls you hobbits, though? That does not sound elvish to me. Elves made all the old words: they began it.'\n\n'Nobody else calls us hobbits; we call ourselves that,' said Pippin.\n\n'Hoom, hmm! Come now! Not so hasty! You call yourselves hobbits? But you should not go telling just anybody. You'll be letting out your own right names if you're not careful.'\n\n'We aren't careful about that,' said Merry. 'As a matter of fact I'm a Brandybuck, Meriadoc Brandybuck, though most people call me just Merry.'\n\n'And I'm a Took, Peregrin Took, but I'm generally called Pippin, or even Pip.'\n\n'Hm, but you are hasty folk, I see,' said Treebeard. 'I am honoured by your confidence; but you should not be too free all at once. There are Ents and Ents, you know; or there are Ents and things that look like Ents but ain't, as you might say. I'll call you Merry and Pippin if you please \u0426 nice names. For I am not going to tell you my name, not yet at any rate.' A queer half-knowing, half-humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes. 'For one thing it would take a long while: my name is growing all the time, and I've lived a very long, long time; so my name is like a story. Real names tell you the story of the things they belong to in my language, in the Old Entish as you might say. It is a lovely language, but it takes a very long time to say anything in it, because we do not say anything in it, unless it is worth taking a long time to say, and to listen to.\n\n'But now,' and the eyes became very bright and 'present', seeming to grow smaller and almost sharp, 'what is going on? What are you doing in it all? I can see and hear (and smell and feel) a great deal from this, from this, from this a-lalla-lalla-rumba-kamanda-lind-or-burume. Excuse me: that is a part of my name for it; I do not know what the word is in the outside languages: you know, the thing we are on, where I stand and look out on fine mornings, and think about the Sun, and the grass beyond the wood, and the horses, and the clouds, and the unfolding of the world. What is going on? What is Gandalf up to? And these \u0426 burarum,' he made a deep rumbling noise like a discord on a great organ \u0426 'these Orcs, and young Saruman down at Isengard? I like news. But not too quick now.'\n\n'There is quite a lot going on,' said Merry: 'and even if we tried to be quick, it would take a long time to tell. But you told us not to be hasty. Ought we to tell you anything so soon? Would you think it rude, if we asked what you are going to do with us, and which side you are on? And did you know Gandalf?'\n\n'Yes, I do know him: the only wizard that really cares about trees,' said Treebeard. 'Do you know him?'\n\n'Yes,' said Pippin sadly, 'we did. He was a great friend, and he was our guide.'\n\n'Then I can answer your other questions,' said Treebeard. 'I am not going to do anything with you: not if you mean by that 'do something to you' without your leave. We might do some things together. I don't know about sides. I go my own way; but your way may go along with mine for a while. But you speak of Master Gandalf, as if he was in a story that had come to an end.'\n\n'Yes, we do,' said Pippin sadly. 'The story seems to be going on, but I am afraid Gandalf has fallen out of it.'\n\n'Hoo, come now!' said Treebeard. 'Hoom, hm, ah well.' He paused, looking long at the hobbits. 'Hoom, ah, well I do not know what to say. Come now!'\n\n'If you would like to hear more. said Merry, 'we will tell you. But it will take some time. Wouldn't you like to put us down? Couldn't we sit here together in the sun, while it lasts? You must be getting tired of holding us up.'\n\n'Hm, tired? No. I am not tired. I do not easily get tired. And I do not sit down. I am not very, hm, bendable. But there, the Sun is going in. Let us leave this \u0426 did you say what you call it?'\n\n'Hill?' suggested Pippin. 'Shelf? Step?' suggested Merry.\n\nTreebeard repeated the words thoughtfully. 'Hill. Yes, that was it. But it is a hasty word for a thing that has stood here ever since this part of the world was shaped. Never mind. Let us leave it, and go.'\n\n'Where shall we go?' asked Merry.\n\n'To my home, or one of my homes,' answered Treebeard.\n\n'Is it far?'\n\n'I do not know. You might call it far, perhaps. But what does that matter?'\n\n'Well, you see, we have lost all our belongings,' said Merry. 'We have only a little food.'\n\n'O! Hm! You need not trouble about that,' said Treebeard. 'I can give you a drink that will keep you green and growing for a long, long while. And if we decide to part company, I can set you down outside my country at any point you choose. Let us go!'\n\nHolding the hobbits gently but firmly, one in the crook of each arm, Treebeard lifted up first one large foot and then the other, and moved them to the edge of the shelf. The rootlike toes grasped the rocks. Then carefully and solemnly, he stalked down from step to step, and reached the floor of the Forest.\n\nAt once he set off with long deliberate strides through the trees, deeper and deeper into the wood, never far from the stream, climbing steadily up towards the slopes of the mountains. Many of the trees seemed asleep, or as unaware of him as of any other creature that merely passed by; but some quivered, and some raised up their branches above his head as he approached. All the while, as he walked, he talked to himself in a long running stream of musical sounds.\n\nThe hobbits were silent for some time. They felt, oddly enough, safe and comfortable, and they had a great deal to think and wonder about. At last Pippin ventured to speak again.\n\n'Please, Treebeard,' he said, 'could I ask you something? Why did Celeborn warn us against your forest? He told us not to risk getting entangled in it.'\n\n'Hmm, did he now?' rumbled Treebeard. 'And I might have said much the same, if you had been going the other way. Do not risk getting entangled in the woods of Laurelindorenan! That is what the Elves used to call it, but now they make the name shorter: Lothlorien they call it. Perhaps they are right: maybe it is fading; not growing. Land of the Valley of Singing Gold, that was it, once upon a time. Now it is the Dreamflower. Ah well! But it is a queer place, and not for just any one to venture in. I am surprised that you ever got out, but much more surprised that you ever got in: that has not happened to strangers for many a year. It is a queer land.\n\n'And so is this. Folk have come to grief here. Aye, they have, to grief. Laurelindorenan lindelorendor malinornelion ornemalin,' he hummed to himself. 'They are falling rather behind the world in there, I guess,' he said 'Neither this country, nor anything else outside the Golden Wood, is what it was when Celeborn was young. Still:\n\n\t\tTaurelilomea-tumbalemorna Tumbaletaurea Lomeanor, [1 - See Appendix F under Ents.]\n\nthat is what they used to say. Things have changed, but it is still true in places.'\n\n'What do you mean?' said Pippin. 'What is true?'\n\n'The trees and the Ents,' said Treebeard. 'I do not understand all that goes on myself, so I cannot explain it to you. Some of us are still true Ents, and lively enough in our fashion, but many are growing sleepy, going tree-ish, as you might say. Most of the trees are just trees, of course; but many are half awake. Some are quite wide awake, and a few are, well, ah, well getting Entish. That is going on all the time.\n\n'When that happens to a tree, you find that some have bad hearts. Nothing to do with their wood: I do not mean that. Why, I knew some good old willows down the Entwash, gone long ago, alas! They were quite hollow, indeed they were falling all to pieces, but as quiet and sweet-spoken as a young leaf. And then there are some trees in the valleys under the mountains, sound as a bell, and bad right through. That sort of thing seems to spread. There used to be some very dangerous parts in this country. There are still some very black patches.'\n\n'Like the Old Forest away to the north, do you mean?' asked Merry.\n\n'Aye, aye, something like, but much worse. I do not doubt there is some shadow of the Great Darkness lying there still away north; and bad memories are handed down. But there are hollow dales in this land where the Darkness has never been lifted, and the trees are older than I am. Still, we do what we can. We keep off strangers and the foolhardy; and we train and we teach, we walk and we weed.\n\n'We are tree-herds, we old Ents. Few enough of us are left now. Sheep get like shepherd, and shepherds like sheep, it is said; but slowly, and neither have long in the world. It is quicker and closer with trees and Ents, and they walk down the ages together. For Ents are more like Elves: less interested in themselves than Men are, and better at getting inside other things. And yet again Ents are more like Men, more changeable than Elves are, and quicker at taking the colour of the outside, you might say. Or better than both: for they are steadier and keep their minds on things longer. 'Some of my kin look just like trees now, and need something great to rouse them; and they speak only in whispers. But some of my trees are limb-lithe, and many can talk to me. Elves began it, of course, waking trees up and teaching them to speak and learning their tree-talk. They always wished to talk to everything, the old Elves did. But then the Great Darkness came, and they passed away over the Sea, or fled into far valleys, and hid themselves, and made songs about days that would never come again. Never again. Aye, aye, there was all one wood once upon a time: from here to the Mountains of Lune, and this was just the East End.\n\n'Those were the broad days! Time was when I could walk and sing all day and hear no more than the echo of my own voice in the hollow hills. The woods were like the woods of Lothlorien, only thicker stronger, younger. And the smell of the air! I used to spend a week just breathing.'\n\nTreebeard fell silent, striding along, and yet making hardly a sound with his great feet. Then he began to hum again, and passed into a murmuring chant. Gradually the hobbits became aware that he was chanting to them:\n\n\t\tIn the willow-meads of Tasarinan I walked in the Spring.\n\t\tAh! the sight and the smell of the Spring in Nan-tasarion!\n\t\tAnd I said that was good.\n\t\tI wandered in Summer in the elm-woods of Ossiriand.\n\t\tAh! the light and the music in the Summer by the Seven Rivers of Ossir!\n\t\tAnd I thought that was best.\n\t\tTo the beeches of Neldoreth I came in the Autumn.\n\t\tAh! the gold and the red and the sighing of leaves in the Autumn in Taur-na-neldor!\n\t\tIt was more than my desire.\n\t\tTo the pine-trees upon the highland of Dorthonion I climbed in the Winter.\n\t\tAh! the wind and the whiteness and the black branches of Winter upon Orod-na-Thon!\n\t\tMy voice went up and sang in the sky.\n\t\tAnd now all those lands lie under the wave.\n\t\tAnd I walk in Ambarona, in Tauremorna, in Aldalome.\n\t\tIn my own land, in the country of Fangorn,\n\t\tWhere the roots are long,\n\t\tAnd the years lie thicker than the leaves\n\t\tIn Tauremornalome.\n\nHe ended, and strode on silently, and in all the wood, as far as ear could reach, there was not a sound.\n\nThe day waned, and dusk was twined about the boles of the trees. At last the hobbits saw, rising dimly before them, a steep dark land: they had come to the feet of the mountains, and to the green roots of tall Methedras. Down the hillside the young Entwash, leaping from its springs high above, ran noisily from step to step to meet them. On the right of the stream there was a long slope, clad with grass, now grey in the twilight. No trees grew there and it was open to the sky; stars were shining already in lakes between shores of cloud.\n\nTreebeard strode up the slope, hardly slackening his pace. Suddenly before them the hobbits saw a wide opening. Two great trees stood there, one on either side, like living gate-posts; but there was no gate save their crossing and interwoven boughs. As the old Ent approached, the trees lifted up their branches, and all their leaves quivered and rustled. For they were evergreen trees, and their leaves were dark and polished, and gleamed in the twilight. Beyond them was a wide level space, as though the floor of a great hall had been cut in the side of the hill. On either hand the walls sloped upwards, until they were fifty feet high or more, and along each wall stood an aisle of trees that also increased in height as they marched inwards.\n\nAt the far end the rock-wall was sheer, but at the bottom it had been hollowed back into a shallow bay with an arched roof: the only roof of the hall, save the branches of the trees, which at the inner end overshadowed all the ground leaving only a broad open path in the middle. A little stream escaped from the springs above, and leaving the main water, fell tinkling down the sheer face of the wall, pouring in silver drops, like a fine curtain in front of the arched bay. The water was gathered again into a stone basin in the floor between the trees, and thence it spilled and flowed away beside the open path, out to rejoin the Entwash in its journey through the forest.\n\n'Hm! Here we are!' said Treebeard, breaking his long silence. 'I have brought you about seventy thousand ent-strides, but what that comes to in the measurement of your land I do not know. Anyhow we are near the roots of the Last Mountain. Part of the name of this place might be Wellinghall, if it were turned into your language. I like it. We will stay here tonight.' He set them down on the grass between the aisles of the trees, and they followed him towards the great arch. The hobbits now noticed that as he walked his knees hardly bent, but his legs opened in a great stride. He planted his big toes (and they were indeed big, and very broad) on the ground first, before any other part of his feet.\n\nFor a moment Treebeard stood under the rain of the falling spring, and took a deep breath; then he laughed, and passed inside. A great stone table stood there, but no chairs. At the back of the bay it was already quite dark. Treebeard lifted two great vessels and stood them on the table. They seemed to be filled with water; but he held his hands over them, and immediately they began to glow, one with a golden and the other with a rich green light; and the blending of the two lights lit the bay; as if the sun of summer was shining through a roof of young leaves. Looking back, the hobbits saw that the trees in the court had also begun to glow, faintly at first, but steadily quickening, until every leaf was edged with light: some green, some gold, some red as copper; while the tree-trunks looked like pillars moulded out of luminous stone.\n\n'Well, well, now we can talk again,' said Treebeard. 'You are thirsty I expect. Perhaps you are also tired. Drink this!' He went to the back of the bay, and then they saw that several tall stone jars stood there, with heavy lids. He removed one of the lids, and dipped in a great ladle, and with it filled three bowls, one very large bowl, and two smaller ones.\n\n'This is an ent-house,' he said, 'and there are no seats, I fear. But you may sit on the table.' Picking up the hobbits he set them on the great stone slab, six feet above the ground, and there they sat dangling their legs, and drinking in sips.\n\nThe drink was like water, indeed very like the taste of the draughts they had drunk from the Entwash near, the borders of the forest, and yet there was some scent or savour in it which they could not describe: it was faint, but it reminded them of the smell of a distant wood borne from afar by a cool breeze at night. The effect of the draught began at the toes, and rose steadily through every limb, bringing refreshment and vigour as it coursed upwards, right to the tips of the hair. Indeed the hobbits felt that the hair on their heads was actually standing up, waving and curling and growing. As for Treebeard, he first laved his feet in the basin beyond the arch, and then he drained his bowl at one draught, one long, slow draught. The hobbits thought he would never stop.\n\nAt last he set the bowl down again. 'Ah \u0426 ah,' he sighed. 'Hm, hoom, now we can talk easier. You can sit on the floor, and I will lie down; that will prevent this drink from rising to my head and sending me to sleep.'\n\nOn the right side of the bay there was a great bed on low legs; not more than a couple of feet high, covered deep in dried grass and bracken. Treebeard lowered himself slowly on to this (with only the slightest sign of bending at his middle), until he lay at full length, with his arms behind his head, looking up at the ceiling. upon which lights were flickering, like the play of leaves in the sunshine. Merry and Pippin sat beside him on pillows of grass.\n\n'Now tell me your tale, and do not hurry!' said Treebeard.\n\nThe hobbits began to tell him the story of their adventures ever since they left Hobbiton. They followed no very clear order, for they interrupted one another continually, and Treebeard often stopped the speaker, and went back to some earlier point, or jumped forward asking questions about later events. They said nothing whatever about the Ring, and did not tell him why they set out or where they were going to; and he did not ask for any reasons.\n\nHe was immensely interested in everything: in the Black Riders, in Elrond, and Rivendell, in the Old Forest, and Tom Bombadil, in the Mines of Moria, and in Lothlorien and Galadriel. He made them describe the Shire and its country over and over again. He said an odd thing at this point. 'You never see any, hm, any Ents round there do you?' he asked. 'Well, not Ents, Entwives I should really say.'\n\n'Entwives?' said Pippin. 'Are they like you at all?'\n\n'Yes, hm, well no: I do not really know now,' said Treebeard thoughtfully. 'But they would like your country, so I just wondered.'\n\nTreebeard was however especially interested in everything that concerned Gandalf; and most interested of all in Saruman's doings. The hobbits regretted very much that they knew so little about them: only a rather vague report by Sam of what Gandalf had told the Council. But they were clear at any rate that Ugluk and his troop came from Isengard, and spoke of Saruman as their master.\n\n'Hm, hoom!' said Treebeard, when at last their story had wound and wandered down to the battle of the Orcs and the Riders of Rohan. 'Well, well! That is a bundle of news and no mistake. You have not told me all, no indeed, not by a long way. But I do not doubt that you are doing as Gandalf would wish. There is something very big going on, that I can see, and what it is maybe I shall learn in good time, or in bad time. By root and twig, but it is a strange business: up sprout a little folk that are not in the old lists, and behold the Nine forgotten Riders reappear to hunt them, and Gandalf takes them on a great journey, and Galadriel harbours them in Caras Galadhon, and Orcs pursue them down all the leagues of Wilderland: indeed they seem to be caught up in a great storm. I hope they weather it!'\n\n'And what about yourself?' asked Merry.\n\n'Hoom, hm, I have not troubled about the Great Wars,' said Treebeard, 'they mostly concern Elves and Men. That is the business of Wizards: Wizards are always troubled about the future. I do not like worrying about the future. I am not altogether on anybody's side, because nobody is altogether on my side, if you understand me: nobody cares for the woods as I care for them, not even Elves nowadays. Still, I take more kindly to Elves than to others: it was the Elves that cured us of dumbness long ago, and that was a great gift that cannot be forgotten, though our ways have parted since. And there are some things, of course, whose side I am altogether not on; I am against them altogether: these \u0426 burarum' (he again made a deep rumble of disgust) '\u0426 these Orcs, and their masters.\n\n'I used to be anxious when the shadow lay on Mirkwood, but when it removed to Mordor, I did not trouble for a while: Mordor is a long way away. But it seems that the wind is setting East, and the withering of all woods may be drawing near. There is naught that an old Ent can do to hold back that storm: he must weather it or crack.\n\n'But Saruman now! Saruman is a neighbour: I cannot overlook him. I must do something, I suppose. I have often wondered lately what I should do about Saruman.'\n\n'Who is Saruman?' asked Pippin. 'Do you know anything about his history?'\n\n'Saruman is a Wizard,' answered Treebeard. 'More than that I cannot say. I do not know the history of Wizards. They appeared first after the Great Ships came over the Sea; but if they came with the Ships I never can tell. Saruman was reckoned great among them, I believe. He gave up wandering about and minding the affairs of Men and Elves, some time ago \u0426 you would call it a very long time ago: and he settled down at Angrenost, or Isengard as the Men of Rohan call it. He was very quiet to begin with, but his fame began to grow. He was chosen to be head of the White Council, they say; but that did not turn out too well. I wonder now if even then Saruman was not turning to evil ways. But at any rate he used to give no trouble to his neighbours. I used to talk to him. There was a time when he was always walking about my woods. He was polite in those days, always asking my leave (at least when he met me); and always eager to listen. I told him many things that he would never have found out by himself; but he never repaid me in like kind. I cannot remember that he ever told me anything. And he got more and more like that; his face, as I remember it \u0426 I have not seen it for many a day \u0426 became like windows in a stone wall: windows with shutters inside.\n\n'I think that I now understand what he is up to. He is plotting to become a Power. He has a mind of metal and wheels; and he does not care for growing things, except as far as they serve him for the moment. And now it is clear that he is a black traitor. He has taken up with foul folk, with the Orcs. Brm, hoom! Worse than that: he has been doing something to them; something dangerous. For these Isengarders are more like wicked Men. It is a mark of evil things that came in the Great Darkness that they cannot abide the Sun; but Saruman's Orcs can endure it, even if they hate it. I wonder what he has done? Are they Men he has ruined, or has he blended the races of Orcs and Men? That would be a black evil!'\n\nTreebeard rumbled for a moment, as if he were pronouncing some deep, subterranean Entish malediction. 'Some time ago I began to wonder how Orcs dared to pass through my woods so freely,' he went on. 'Only lately did I guess that Saruman was to blame, and that long ago he had been spying out all the ways, and discovering my secrets. He and his foul folk are making havoc now. Down on the borders they are felling trees \u0426 good trees. Some of the trees they just cut down and leave to rot \u0426 orc-mischief that; but most are hewn up and carried off to feed the fires of Orthanc. There is always a smoke rising from Isengard these days.\n\n'Curse him, root and branch! Many of those trees were my friends creatures I had known from nut and acorn; many had voices of their own that are lost for ever now. And there are wastes of stump and bramble where once there were singing groves. I have been idle. I have let things slip. It must stop!'\n\nTreebeard raised himself from his bed with a jerk, stood up, and thumped his hand on the table. The vessels of light trembled and sent up two jets of flame. There was a flicker like green fire in his eyes, and his beard stood out stiff as a great besom.\n\n'I will stop it!' he boomed. 'And you shall come with me. You may be able to help me. You will be helping your own friends that way, too; for if Saruman is not checked Rohan and Gondor will have an enemy behind as well as in front. Our roads go together \u0426 to Isengard!'\n\n'We will come with you,' said Merry. 'We will do what we can.'\n\n'Yes!' said Pippin. 'I should like to see the White Hand overthrown. I should like to be there, even if I could not be of much use: I shall never forget Ugluk and the crossing of Rohan.'\n\n'Good! Good!' said Treebeard. 'But I spoke hastily. We must not be hasty. I have become too hot. I must cool myself and think; fur it is easier to shout stop! than to do it.'\n\nHe strode to the archway and stood for some time under the falling rain of the spring. Then he laughed and shook himself, and wherever the drops of water fell glittering from him to the ground they glinted like red and green sparks. He came back and laid himself on the bed again and was silent.\n\nAfter some time the hobbits heard him murmuring again. He seemed to be counting on his fingers. 'Fangorn, Finglas, Fladrif, aye, aye,' he sighed. 'The trouble is that there are so few of us left,' he said turning towards the hobbits. 'Only three remain of the first Ents that walked in the woods before the Darkness: only myself, Fangorn, and Finglas and Fladrif \u0426 to give them their Elvish names; you may call them Leaflock and Skinbark if you like that better. And of us three Leaflock and Skinbark are not much use for this business. Leaflock has grown sleepy, almost tree-ish, you might say: he has taken to standing by himself half-asleep all through the summer with the deep grass of the meadows round his knees. Covered with leafy hair he is. He used to rouse up in winter; but of late he has been too drowsy to walk far even then. Skinbark lived on the mountain-slopes west of Isengard. That is where the worst trouble has been. He was wounded by the Orcs, and many of his folk and his tree-herds have been murdered and destroyed. He has gone up into the high places, among the birches that he loves best, and he will not come down. Still, I daresay I could get together a fair company of our younger folks \u0426 if I could make them understand the need; if I could rouse them: we are not a hasty folk. What a pity there are so few of us!'\n\n'Why are there so few when you have lived in this country so long?' asked Pippin. 'Have a great many died?'\n\n'Oh, no!' said Treebeard. 'None have died from inside, as you might say. Some have fallen in the evil chances of the long years, of course: and more have grown tree-ish. But there were never many of us and we have not increased. There have been no Entings \u0426 no children, you would say, not for a terrible long count of years. You see, we lost the Entwives.'\n\n'How very sad!' said Pippin. 'How was it that they all died?'\n\n'They did not die!' said Treebeard. 'I never said died. We lost them, I said. We lost them and we cannot find them.' He sighed. 'I thought most folk knew that. There were songs about the hunt of the Ents for the Entwives sung among Elves and Men from Mirkwood to Gondor. They cannot be quite forgotten.'\n\n'Well, I am afraid the songs have not come west over the Mountains to the Shire,' said Merry. 'Won't you tell us some more, or sing us one of the songs?'\n\n'Yes, I will indeed,' said Treebeard, seeming pleased with the request. 'But I cannot tell it properly, only in short; and then we must end our talk: tomorrow we have councils to call, and work to do, and maybe a journey to begin.'\n\n'It is rather a strange and sad story,' he went on after a pause. 'When the world was young, and the woods were wide and wild, the Ents and the Entwives \u0426 and there were Entmaidens then: ah! the loveliness of Fimbrethil, of Wandlimb the lightfooted, in the days of our youth! \u0426 they walked together and they housed together. But our hearts did not go on growing in the same way: the Ents gave their love to things that they met in the world, and the Entwives gave their thought to other things, for the Ents loved the great trees; and the wild woods, and the slopes of the high hills; and they drank of the mountain-streams, and ate only such fruit as the trees let fall in their path; and they learned of the Elves and spoke with the Trees. But the Entwives gave their minds to the lesser trees, and to the meads in the sunshine beyond the feet of the forests; and they saw the sloe in the thicket, and the wild apple and the cherry blossoming in spring, and the green herbs in the waterlands in summer, and the seeding grasses in the autumn fields. They did not desire to speak with these things; but they wished them to hear and obey what was said to them. The Entwives ordered them to grow according to their wishes, and bear leaf and fruit to their liking; for the Entwives desired order, and plenty, and peace (by which they meant that things should remain where they had set them). So the Entwives made gardens to live in. But we Ents went on wandering, and we only came to the gardens now and again. Then when the Darkness came in the North, the Entwives crossed the Great River, and made new gardens, and tilled new fields, and we saw them more seldom. After the Darkness was overthrown the land of the Entwives blossomed richly, and their fields were full of corn. Many men learned the crafts of the Entwives and honoured them greatly; but we were only a legend to them, a secret in the heart of the forest. Yet here we still are, while all the gardens of the Entwives are wasted: Men call them the Brown Lands now.\n\n'I remember it was long ago \u0426 in the time of the war between Sauron and the Men of the Sea \u0426 desire came over me to see Fimbrethil again. Very fair she was still in my eyes, when I had last seen her, though little like the Entmaiden of old. For the Entwives were bent and browned by their labour; their hair parched by the sun to the hue of ripe corn and their cheeks like red apples. Yet their eyes were still the eyes of our own people. We crossed over Anduin and came to their land: but we found a desert: it was all burned and uprooted, for war had passed over it. But the Entwives were not there. Long we called, and long we searched; and we asked all folk that we met which way the Entwives had gone. Some said they had never seen them; and some said that they had seen them walking away west, and some said east, and others south. But nowhere that we went could we find them. Our sorrow was very great. Yet the wild wood called, and we returned to it. For many years we used to go out every now and again and look for the Entwives, walking far and wide and calling them by their beautiful names. But as time passed we went more seldom and wandered less far. And now the Entwives are only a memory for us, and our beards are long and grey. The Elves made many songs concerning the Search of the Ents, and some of the songs passed into the tongues of Men. But we made no songs about it, being content to chant their beautiful names when we thought of the Entwives. We believe that we may meet again in a time to come, and perhaps we shall find somewhere a land where we can live together and both be content. But it is foreboded that that will only be when we have both lost all that we now have. And it may well be that that time is drawing near at last. For if Sauron of old destroyed the gardens, the Enemy today seems likely to wither all the woods.\n\n'There was an Elvish song that spoke of this, or at least so I understand it. It used to be sung up and down the Great River. It was never an Entish song, mark you: it would have been a very long song in Entish! But we know it by heart, and hum it now and again. This is how it runs in your tongue:\n\n\nEnt.\n\n\t\tWhen Spring unfolds the beechen leaf, and sap is in the bough;\n\t\tWhen light is on the wild-wood stream, and wind is on the brow;\n\t\tWhen stride is long, and breath is deep, and keen the mountain-air,\n\t\tCome back to me! Come back to me, and say my land is fair!\n\nEntwife.\n\n\t\tWhen Spring is come to garth and field, and corn is in the blade;\n\t\tWhen blossom like a shining snow is on the orchard laid;\n\t\tWhen shower and Sun upon the Earth with fragrance fill the air,\n\t\tI'll linger here, and will not come, because my land is fair.\n\nEnt.\n\n\t\tWhen Summer lies upon the world, and in a noon of gold\n\t\tBeneath the roof of sleeping leaves the dreams of trees unfold;\n\t\tWhen woodland halls are green and cool, and wind is in the West,\n\t\tCome back to me! Come back to me, and say my land is best!\n\nEntwife.\n\n\t\tWhen Summer warms the hanging fruit and burns the berry brown;\n\t\tWhen straw is gold, and ear is white, and harvest comes to town;\n\t\tWhen honey spills, and apple swells, though wind be in the West,\n\t\tI'll linger here beneath the Sun, because my land is best!\n\nEnt.\n\n\t\tWhen Winter comes, the winter wild that hill and wood shall slay;\n\t\tWhen trees shall fall and starless night devour the sunless day;\n\t\tWhen wind is in the deadly East, then in the bitter rain\n\t\tI'll look for thee, and call to thee; I'll come to thee again!\n\nEntwife.\n\n\t\tWhen Winter comes, and singing ends; when darkness falls at last;\n\t\tWhen broken is the barren bough, and light and labour past;\n\t\tI'll look for thee, and wait for thee, until we meet again:\n\t\tTogether we will take the road beneath the bitter rain!\n\nBoth.\n\n\t\tTogether we will take the road that leads into the West,\n\t\tAnd far away will find a land where both our hearts may rest.\n\nTreebeard ended his song. 'That is how it goes,' he said. 'It is Elvish, of course: lighthearted, quickworded, and soon over. I daresay it is fair enough. But the Ents could say more on their side, if they had time! But now I am going to stand up and take a little sleep. Where will you stand?'\n\n'We usually lie down to sleep,' said Merry. 'We shall be all right where we are.'\n\n'Lie down to sleep!' said Treebeard. 'Why of course you do! Hm, hoom; I was forgetting: singing that song put me in mind of old times; almost thought that I was talking to young Entings, I did. Well, you can lie on the bed. I am going to stand in the rain. Good night!'\n\nMerry and Pippin climbed on to the bed and curled up in the soft grass and fern. It was fresh, and sweet-scented, and warm. The lights died down, and the glow of the trees faded; but outside under the arch they could see old Treebeard standing, motionless, with his arms raised above his head. The bright stars peered out of the sky, and lit the falling water as it spilled on to his fingers and head, and dripped, dripped, in hundreds of silver drops on to his feet. Listening to the tinkling of the drops the hobbits fell asleep.\n\nThey woke to find a cool sun shining into the great court, and on to the floor of the bay. Shreds of high cloud were overhead, running on a stiff easterly wind. Treebeard was not to be seen; but while Merry and Pippin were bathing in the basin by the arch, they heard him humming and singing, as he came up the path between the trees.\n\n'Hoo, ho! Good morning, Merry and Pippin!' he boomed, when he saw them. 'You sleep long. I have been many a hundred strides already today. Now we will have a drink, and go to Entmoot.'\n\nHe poured them out two full bowls from a stone jar; but from a different jar. The taste was not the same as it had been the night before: it was earthier and richer, more sustaining and food-like, so to speak. While the hobbits drank, sitting on the edge of the bed, and nibbling small pieces of elf-cake (more because they felt that eating was a necessary part of breakfast than because they felt hungry), Treebeard stood, humming in Entish or Elvish or some strange tongue, and looking up at the sky.\n\n'Where is Entmoot?' Pippin ventured to ask.\n\n'Hoo, eh? Entmoot?' said Treebeard, turning round. 'It is not a place, it is a gathering of Ents \u0426 which does not often happen nowadays. But I have managed to make a fair number promise to come. We shall meet in the place where we have always met: Derndingle Men call it. It is away south from here. We must be there before noon.'\n\nBefore long they set off. Treebeard carried the hobbits in his arms as on the previous day. At the entrance to the court he turned to the right, stepped over the stream, and strode away southwards along the feet of great tumbled slopes where trees were scanty. Above these the hobbits saw thickets of birch and rowan, and beyond them dark climbing pinewoods. Soon Treebeard turned a little away from the hills and plunged into deep groves, where the trees were larger, taller, and thicker than any that the hobbits had ever seen before. For a while they felt faintly the sense of stifling which they had noticed when they first ventured into Fangorn, but it soon passed. Treebeard did not talk to them. He hummed to himself deeply and thoughtfully, but Merry and Pippin caught no proper words: it sounded like boom, boom, rumboom, boorar, boom, boom, dahrar boom boom, dahrar boom, and so on with a constant change of note and rhythm. Now and again they thought they heard an answer, a hum or a quiver of sound, that seemed to come out of the earth, or from boughs above their heads, or perhaps from the boles of the trees; but Treebeard did not stop or turn his head to either side.\n\nThey had been going for a long while \u0426 Pippin had tried to keep count of the 'ent-strides' but had failed, getting lost at about three thousand \u0426 when Treebeard began to slacken his pace. Suddenly he stopped, put the hobbits down, and raised his curled hands to his mouth so that they made a hollow tube; then he blew or called through them. A great hoom, hom rang out like a deep-throated horn in the woods, and seemed to echo from the trees. Far off there came from several directions a similar hoom, hom, hoom that was not an echo but an answer.\n\nTreebeard now perched Merry and Pippin on his shoulders and strode on again, every now and then sending out another horn-call, and each time the answers came louder and nearer. In this way they came at last to what looked like an impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees, trees of a kind that the hobbits had never seen before: they branched out right from the roots, and were densely clad in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly, and they bore many stiff upright flower-spikes with large shining olive-coloured buds.\n\nTurning to the left and skirting this huge hedge Treebeard came in a few strides to a narrow entrance. Through it a worn path passed and dived suddenly down a long steep slope. The hobbits saw that they were descending into a great dingle, almost as round as a bowl, very wide and deep, crowned at the rim with the high dark evergreen hedge. It was smooth and grassclad inside, and there were no trees except three very tall and beautiful silver-birches that stood at the bottom of the bowl. Two other paths led down into the dingle: from the west and from the east.\n\nSeveral Ents had already arrived. More were coming in down the other paths, and some were now following Treebeard. As they drew near the hobbits gazed at them. They had expected to see a number of creatures as much like Treebeard as one hobbit is like another (at any rate to a stranger's eye); and they were very much surprised to see nothing of the kind. The Ents were as different from one another as trees from trees: some as different as one tree is from another of the same name but quite different growth and history; and some as different as one tree-kind from another, as birch from beech; oak from fir. There were a few older Ents, bearded and gnarled like hale but ancient trees (though none looked as ancient as Treebeard); and there were tall strong Ents, clean-limbed and smooth-skinned like forest-trees in their prime; but there were no young Ents, no saplings. Altogether there were about two dozen standing on the wide grassy floor of the dingle, and as many more were marching in.\n\nAt first Merry and Pippin were struck chiefly by the variety that they saw: the many shapes, and colours, the differences in girth; and height, and length of leg and arm; and in the number of toes and fingers (anything from three to nine). A few seemed more or less related to Treebeard, and reminded them of beech-trees or oaks. But there were other kinds. Some recalled the chestnut: brown-skinned Ents with large splayfingered hands, and short thick legs. Some recalled the ash: tall straight grey Ents with many-fingered hands and long legs; some the fir (the tallest Ents), and others the birch, the rowan, and the linden. But when the Ents all gathered round Treebeard, bowing their heads slightly, murmuring in their slow musical voices, and looking long and intently at the strangers, then the hobbits saw that they were all of the same kindred, and all had the same eyes: not all so old or so deep as Treebeard's, but all with the same slow, steady, thoughtful expression, and the same green flicker.\n\nAs soon as the whole company was assembled, standing in a wide circle round Treebeard, a curious and unintelligible conversation began. The Ents began to murmur slowly: first one joined and then another, until they were all chanting together in a long rising and falling rhythm, now louder on one side of the ring, now dying away there and rising to a great boom on the other side. Though he could not catch or understand any of the words \u0426 he supposed the language was Entish \u0426 Pippin found the sound very pleasant to listen to at first; but gradually his attention wavered. After a long time (and the chant showed no signs of slackening) he found himself wondering, since Entish was such an 'unhasty' language, whether they had yet got further than Good Morning; and if Treebeard was to call the roll, how many days it would take to sing all their names. 'I wonder what the Entish is for yes or no,' he thought. He yawned.\n\nTreebeard was immediately aware of him. 'Hm, ha, hey, my Pippin!' he said, and the other Ents all stopped their chant. 'You are a hasty folk, I was forgetting; and anyway it is wearisome listening to a speech you do not understand. You may get down now. I have told your names to the Entmoot, and they have seen you, and they have agreed that you are not Orcs, and that a new line shall be put in the old lists. We have got no further yet, but that is quick work for an Entmoot. You and Merry can stroll about in the dingle, if you like. There is a well of good water, if you need refreshing, away yonder in the north bank. There are still some words to speak before the Moot really begins. I will come and see you again, and tell you how things are going.'\n\nHe put the hobbits down. Before they walked away, they bowed low. This feat seemed to amuse the Ents very much, to judge by the tone of their murmurs, and the flicker of their eyes; but they soon turned back to their own business. Merry and Pippin climbed up the path that came in from the west, and looked through the opening in the great hedge. Long tree-clad slopes rose from the lip of the dingle, and away beyond them, above the fir-trees of the furthest ridge there rose, sharp and white, the peak of a high mountain. Southwards to their left they could see the forest falling away down into the grey distance. There far away there was a pale green glimmer that Merry guessed to be a glimpse of the plains of Rohan.\n\n'I wonder where Isengard is?' said Pippin.\n\n'I don't know quite where we are,' said Merry; 'but that peak is probably Methedras, and as far as I can remember the ring of Isengard lies in a fork or deep cleft at the end of the mountains. It is probably down behind this great ridge. There seems to be a smoke or haze over there, left of the peak, don't you think?'\n\n'What is Isengard like?' said Pippin. 'I wonder what Ents can do about it anyway.'\n\n'So do I,' said Merry. 'Isengard is a sort of ring of rocks or hills, I think, with a flat space inside and an island or pillar of rock in the middle, called Orthanc. Saruman has a tower on it. There is a gate, perhaps more than one, in the encircling wall, and I believe there is a stream running through it; it comes out of the mountains, and flows on across the Gap of Rohan. It does not seem the sort of place for Ents to tackle. But I have an odd feeling about these Ents: somehow I don't think they are quite as safe and, well, funny as they seem. They seem slow, queer, and patient, almost sad; and yet I believe they could be roused. If that happened, I would rather not be on the other side.'\n\n'Yes!' said Pippin. 'I know what you mean. There might be all the difference between an old cow sitting and thoughtfully chewing, and a bull charging; and the change might come suddenly. I wonder if Treebeard will rouse them. I am sure he means to try. But they don't like being roused. Treebeard got roused himself last night, and then bottled it up again.'\n\nThe hobbits turned back. The voices of the Ents were still rising and falling in their conclave. The sun had now risen high enough to look over the high hedge: it gleamed on the tops of the birches and lit the northward side of the dingle with a cool yellow light. There they saw a little glittering fountain. They walked along the rim of the great bowl at the feet of the evergreens \u0426 it was pleasant to feel cool grass about their toes again, and not to be in a hurry \u0426 and then they climbed down to the gushing water. They drank a little, a clean, cold, sharp draught, and sat down on a mossy stone, watching the patches of sun on the grass and the shadows of the sailing clouds passing over the floor of the dingle. The murmur of the Ents went on. It seemed a very strange and remote place, outside their world, and far from everything that had ever happened to them. A great longing came over them for the faces and voices of their companions, especially for Frodo and Sam, and for Strider.\n\nAt last there came a pause in the Ent-voices; and looking up they saw Treebeard coming towards them. with another Ent at his side.\n\n'Hm, hoom, here I am again,' said Treebeard. 'Are you getting weary, or feeling impatient, hmm, eh? Well, I am afraid that you must not get impatient yet. We have finished the first stage now; but I have still got to explain things again to those that live a long way off, far from Isengard, and those that I could not get round to before the Moot, and after that we shall have to decide what to do. However, deciding what to do does not take Ents so long as going over all the facts and events that they have to make up their minds about. Still, it is no use denying, we shall be here a long time yet: a couple of days very likely. So I have brought you a companion. He has an ent-house nearby. Bregalad is his Elvish name. He says he has already made up his mind and does not need to remain at the Moot. Hm, hm, he is the nearest thing among us to a hasty Ent. You ought to get on together. Good-bye!' Treebeard turned and left them.\n\nBregalad stood for some time surveying the hobbits solemnly; and they looked at him, wondering when he would show any signs of 'hastiness'. He was tall, and seemed to be one of the younger Ents; he had smooth shining skin on his arms and legs; his lips were ruddy, and his hair was grey-green. He could bend and sway like a slender tree in the wind. At last he spoke, and his voice though resonant was higher and clearer than Treebeard's.\n\n'Ha, hmm, my friends, let us go for a walk!' he said. 'I am Bregalad, that is Quickbeam in your language. But it is only a nickname, of course. They have called me that ever since I said yes to an elder Ent before he had finished his question. Also I drink quickly, and go out while some are still wetting their beards. Come with me!'\n\nHe reached down two shapely arms and gave a long-fingered hand to each of the hobbits. All that day they walked about in the woods with him, singing, and laughing; for Quickbeam often laughed. He laughed if the sun came out from behind a cloud, he laughed if they came upon a stream or spring: then he stooped and splashed his feet and head with water; he laughed sometimes at some sound or whisper in the trees. Whenever he saw a rowan-tree he halted a while with his arms stretched out, and sang, and swayed as he sang.\n\nAt nightfall he brought them to his ent-house: nothing more than a mossy stone set upon turves under a green bank. Rowan-trees grew in a circle about it, and there was water (as in all ent-houses), a spring bubbling out from the bank. They talked for a while as darkness fell on the forest. Not far away the voices of the Entmoot could be heard still going on; but now they seemed deeper and less leisurely, and every now and again one great voice would rise in a high and quickening music, while all the others died away. But beside them Bregalad spoke gently in their own tongue, almost whispering; and they learned that he belonged to Skinbark's people, and the country where they had lived had been ravaged. That seemed to the hobbits quite enough to explain his 'hastiness', at least in the matter of Orcs.\n\n'There were rowan-trees in my home,' said Bregalad, softly and sadly, 'rowan-trees that took root when I was an Enting, many many years ago in the quiet of the world. The oldest were planted by the Ents to try and please the Entwives; but they looked at them and smiled and said that they knew where whiter blossom and richer fruit were growing. Yet there are no trees of all that race, the people of the Rose, that are so beautiful to me. And these trees grew and grew, till the shadow of each was like a green hall, and their red berries in the autumn were a burden, and a beauty and a wonder. Birds used to flock there. I like birds, even when they chatter; and the rowan has enough and to spare. But the birds became unfriendly and greedy and tore at the trees, and threw the fruit down and did not eat it. Then Orcs came with axes and cut down my trees. I came and called them by their long names, but they did not quiver, they did not hear or answer: they lay dead.\n\n\t\tO Orofarne, Lassemista, Carnimirie!\n\t\tO rowan fair, upon your hair how white the blossom lay!\n\t\tO rowan mine, I saw you shine upon a summer's day,\n\t\tYour rind so bright, your leaves so light, your voice so cool and soft;\n\t\tUpon your head how golden-red the crown you bore aloft!\n\t\tO rowan dead, upon your head your hair is dry and grey;\n\t\tYour crown is spilled, your voice is stilled for ever and a day.\n\t\tO Orofarne, Lassemista, Carnimirie!\n\nThe hobbits fell asleep to the sound of the soft singing of Bregalad, that seemed to lament in many tongues the fall of trees that he had loved.\n\nThe next day they spent also in his company, but they did not go far from his 'house'. Most of the time they sat silent under the shelter of the bank; for the wind was colder, and the clouds closer and greyer; there was little sunshine, and in the distance the voices of the Ents at the Moot still rose and fell, sometimes loud and strong, sometimes low and sad, sometimes quickening, sometimes slow and solemn as a dirge. A second night came and still the Ents held conclave under hurrying clouds and fitful stars.\n\nThe third day broke, bleak and windy. At sunrise the Ents' voices rose to a great clamour and then died down again. As the morning wore on the wind fell and the air grew heavy with expectancy. The hobbits could see that Bregalad was now listening intently, although to them, down in the dell of his ent-house, the sound of the Moot was faint.\n\nThe afternoon came, and the sun, going west towards the mountains, sent out long yellow beams between the cracks and fissures of the clouds. Suddenly they were aware that everything was very quiet; the whole forest stood in listening silence. Of course, the Ent-voices had stopped. What did that mean? Bregalad was standing up erect and tense, looking back northwards towards Derndingle.\n\nThen with a crash came a great ringing shout: ra-hoom-rah! The trees quivered and bent as if a gust had struck them. There was another pause, and then a marching music began like solemn drums, and above the rolling beats and booms there welled voices singing high and strong.\n\n\t\tWe come, we come with roll of drum: ta-runda runda runda rom!\n\nThe Ents were coming: ever nearer and louder rose their song:\n\n\t\tWe come, we come with horn and drum: ta-runa runa runa rom!\n\nBregalad picked up the hobbits and strode from his house.\n\nBefore long they saw the marching line approaching: the Ents were swinging along with great strides down the slope towards them. Treebeard was at their head, and some fifty followers were behind him, two abreast, keeping step with their feet and beating time with their hands upon their flanks. As they drew near the flash and flicker of their eyes could be seen.\n\n'Hoom, hom! Here we come with a boom, here we come at last!' called Treebeard when he caught sight of Bregalad and the hobbits. 'Come, join the Moot! We are off. We are off to Isengard!'\n\n'To Isengard!' the Ents cried in many voices.\n\n'To Isengard!'\n\n\t\tTo Isengard! Though Isengard be ringed and barred with doors of stone;\n\t\tThough Isengard be strong and hard, as cold as stone and bare as bone,\n\t\tWe go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door;\n\t\tFor bole and bough are burning now, the furnace roars \u0426 we go to war!\n\t\tTo land of gloom with tramp of doom, with roll of drum, we come, we come;\n\t\tTo Isengard with doom we come!\n\t\tWith doom we come, with doom we come!\n\nSo they sang as they marched southwards.\n\nBregalad, his eyes shining, swung into the line beside Treebeard. The old Ent now took the hobbits back, and set them on his shoulders again, and so they rode proudly at the head of the singing company with beating hearts and heads held high. Though they had expected something to happen eventually, they were amazed at the change that had come over the Ents. It seemed now as sudden as the bursting of a flood that had long been held back by a dike.\n\n'The Ents made up their minds rather quickly, after all, didn't they?' Pippin ventured to say after some time, when for a moment the singing paused, and only the beating of hands and feet was heard.\n\n'Quickly?' said Treebeard. 'Hoom! Yes, indeed. Quicker than I expected. Indeed I have not seen them roused like this for many an age. We Ents do not like being roused; and we never are roused unless it is clear to us that our trees and our lives are in great danger. That has not happened in this Forest since the wars of Sauron and the Men of the Sea. It is the orc-work, the wanton hewing \u0426 rarum \u0426 without even the bad excuse of feeding the fires, that has so angered us; and the treachery of a neighbour, who should have helped us. Wizards ought to know better: they do know better. There is no curse in Elvish, Entish, or the tongues of Men bad enough for such treachery. Down with Saruman!'\n\n'Will you really break the doors of Isengard?' asked Merry.\n\n'Ho, hm, well, we could, you know! You do not know, perhaps, how strong we are. Maybe you have heard of Trolls? They are mighty strong. But Trolls are only counterfeits, made by the Enemy in the Great Darkness, in mockery of Ents, as Orcs were of Elves. We are stronger than Trolls. We are made of the bones of the earth. We can split stone like the roots of trees, only quicker, far quicker, if our minds are roused! If we are not hewn down, or destroyed by fire or blast of sorcery, we could split Isengard into splinters and crack its walls into rubble.'\n\n'But Saruman will try to stop you, won't he?'\n\n'Hm, ah, yes, that is so. I have not forgotten it. Indeed I have thought long about it. But, you see, many of the Ents are younger than I am, by many lives of trees. They are all roused now, and their mind is all on one thing: breaking Isengard. But they will start thinking again before long; they will cool down a little, when we take our evening drink. What a thirst we shall have! But let them march now and sing! We have a long way to go, and there is time ahead for thought. It is something to have started.'\n\nTreebeard marched on, singing with the others for a while. But after a time his voice died to a murmur and fell silent again. Pippin could see that his old brow was wrinkled and knotted. At last he looked up, and Pippin could see a sad look in his eyes, sad but not unhappy. There was a light in them, as if the green flame had sunk deeper into the dark wells of his thought.\n\n'Of course, it is likely enough, my friends,' he said slowly, 'likely enough that we are going to our doom: the last march of the Ents. But if we stayed at home and did nothing, doom would find us anyway, sooner or later. That thought has long been growing in our hearts; and that is why we are marching now. It was not a hasty resolve. Now at least the last march of the Ents may be worth a song. Aye,' he sighed, 'we may help the other peoples before we pass away. Still, I should have liked to see the songs come true about the Entwives. I should dearly have liked to see Fimbrethil again. But there, my friends, songs like trees bear fruit only in their own time and their own way: and sometimes they are withered untimely.'\n\nThe Ents went striding on at a great pace. They had descended into a long fold of the land that fell away southward; now they began to climb up, and up, on to the high western ridge. The woods fell away and they came to scattered groups of birch, and then to bare slopes where only a few gaunt pine-trees grew. The sun sank behind the dark hill-back in front. Grey dusk fell.\n\nPippin looked behind. The number of the Ents had grown \u0426 or what was happening? Where the dim bare slopes that they had crossed should lie, he thought he saw groves of trees. But they were moving! Could it be that the trees of Fangorn were awake, and the forest was rising, marching over the hills to war? He rubbed his eyes wondering if sleep and shadow had deceived him; but the great grey shapes moved steadily onward. There was a noise like wind in many branches. The Ents were drawing near the crest of the ridge now, and all song had ceased. Night fell, and there was silence: nothing was to be heard save a faint quiver of the earth beneath the feet of the Ents, and a rustle, the shade of a whisper as of many drifting leaves. At last they stood upon the summit, and looked down into a dark pit: the great cleft at the end of the mountains: Nan Curunir, the Valley of Saruman.\n\n'Night lies over Isengard,' said Treebeard.\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe White Rider\n\n'My very bones are chilled,' said Gimli, flapping his arms and stamping his feet. Day had come at last. At dawn the companions had made such breakfast as they could; now in the growing light they were getting ready to search the ground again for signs of the hobbits.\n\n'And do not forget that old man!' said Gimli. 'I should be happier if I could see the print of a boot.'\n\n'Why would that make you happy?' said Legolas.\n\n'Because an old man with feet that leave marks might be no more than he seemed,' answered the Dwarf.\n\n'Maybe,' said the Elf; 'but a heavy boot might leave no print here: the grass is deep and springy.'\n\n'That would not baffle a Ranger,' said Gimli. 'A bent blade is enough for Aragorn to read. But I do not expect him to find any traces. It was an evil phantom of Saruman that we saw last night. I am sure of it, even under the light of morning. His eyes are looking out on us from Fangorn even now, maybe.'\n\n'It is likely enough,' said Aragorn; 'yet I am not sure. I am thinking of the horses. You said last night, Gimli, that they were scared away. But I did not think so. Did you hear them, Legolas? Did they sound to you like beasts in terror?'\n\n'No,' said Legolas. 'I heard them clearly. But for the darkness and our own fear I should have guessed that they were beasts wild with some sudden gladness. They spoke as horses will when they meet a friend that they have long missed.'\n\n'So I thought,' said Aragorn; 'but I cannot read the riddle, unless they return. Come! The light is growing fast. Let us look first and guess later! We should begin here, near to our own camping-ground, searching carefully all about, and working up the slope towards the forest. To find the hobbits is our errand, whatever we may think of our visitor in the night. If they escaped by some chance, then they must have hidden in the trees, or they would have been seen. If we find nothing between here and the eaves of the wood, then we will make a last search upon the battle-field and among the ashes. But there is little hope there: the horsemen of Rohan did their work too well.'\n\nFor some time the companions crawled and groped upon the ground. The tree stood mournfully above them, its dry leaves now hanging limp, and rattling in the chill easterly wind. Aragorn moved slowly away. He came to the ashes of the watch-fire near the river-bank, and then began to retrace the ground back towards the knoll where the battle had been fought. Suddenly he stooped and bent low with his face almost in the grass. Then he called to the others. They came running up.\n\n'Here at last we find news!' said Aragorn. He lifted up a broken leaf for them to see, a large pale leaf of golden hue, now fading and turning brown. 'Here is a mallorn-leaf of Lorien, and there are small crumbs on it, and a few more crumbs in the grass. And see! there are some pieces of cut cord lying nearby!'\n\n'And here is the knife that cut them!' said Gimli. He stooped and drew out of a tussock, into which some heavy foot had trampled it, a short jagged blade. The haft from which it had been snapped was beside it. 'It was an orc-weapon,' he said, holding it gingerly, and looking with disgust at the carved handle: it had been shaped like a hideous head with squinting eyes and leering mouth.\n\n'Well, here is the strangest riddle that we have yet found!' exclaimed Legolas. 'A bound prisoner escapes both from the Orcs and from the surrounding horsemen. He then stops, while still in the open, and cuts his bonds with an orc-knife. But how and why? For if his legs were tied, how did he walk? And if his arms were tied, how did he use the knife? And if neither were tied, why did he cut the cords at all? Being pleased with his skill, he then sat down and quietly ate some waybread! That at least is enough to show that he was a hobbit, without the mallorn-leaf. After that, I suppose, he turned his arms into wings and flew away singing into the trees. It should be easy to find him: we only need wings ourselves!'\n\n'There was sorcery here right enough,' said Gimli. 'What was that old man doing? What have you to say, Aragorn, to the reading of Legolas. Can you better it?'\n\n'Maybe, I could,' said Aragorn, smiling. 'There are some other signs near at hand that you have not considered. I agree that the prisoner was a hobbit and must have had either legs or hands free, before he came here. I guess that it was hands, because the riddle then becomes easier, and also because, as I read the marks, he was carried to this point by an Orc. Blood was spilled there, a few paces away, orc-blood. There are deep prints of hoofs all about this spot, and signs that a heavy thing was dragged away. The Orc was slain by horsemen, and later his body was hauled to the fire. But the hobbit was not seen: he was not \"in the open\", for it was night and he still had his elven-cloak. He was exhausted and hungry, and it is not to be wondered at that, when he had cut his bonds with the knife of his fallen enemy, he rested and ate a little before he crept away. But it is a comfort to know that he had some lembas in his pocket, even though he ran away without gear or pack; that, perhaps, is like a hobbit. I say he, though I hope and guess that both Merry and Pippin were here together. There is, however, nothing to show that for certain.'\n\n'And how do you suppose that either of our friends came to have a hand free?' asked Gimli.\n\n'I do not know how it happened,' answered Aragorn. 'Nor do I know why an Orc was carrying them away. Not to help them to escape, we may be sure. Nay, rather I think that I now begin to understand a matter that has puzzled me from the beginning: why when Boromir had fallen were the Orcs content with the capture of Merry and Pippin? They did not seek out the rest of us, nor attack our camp; but instead they went with all speed towards Isengard. Did they suppose they had captured the Ring-bearer and his faithful comrade? I think not. Their masters would not dare to give such plain orders to Orcs, even if they knew so much themselves; they would not speak openly to them of the Ring: they are not trusty servants. But I think the Orcs had been commanded to capture hobbits, alive, at all costs. An attempt was made to slip out with the precious prisoners before the battle. Treachery perhaps, likely enough with such folk; some large and bold Orc may have been trying to escape with the prize alone, for his own ends. There, that is my tale. Others might be devised. But on this we may count in any case: one at least of our friends escaped. It is our task to find him and help him before we return to Rohan. We must not be daunted by Fangorn, since need drove him into that dark place.'\n\n'I do not know which daunts me more: Fangorn, or the thought of the long road through Rohan on foot,' said Gimli.\n\n'Then let us go to the forest,' said Aragorn.\n\nIt was not long before Aragorn found fresh signs. At one point, near the bank of the Entwash, he came upon footprints: hobbit-prints, but too light for much to be made of them. Then again beneath the bole of a great tree on the very edge of the wood more prints were discovered. The earth was bare and dry, and did not reveal much.\n\n'One hobbit at least stood here for a while and looked back; and then he turned away into the forest,' said Aragorn.\n\n'Then we must go in, too,' said Gimli. 'But I do not like the look of this Fangorn: and we were warned against it. I wish the chase had led anywhere else!'\n\n'I do not think the wood feels evil, whatever tales may say,' said Legolas. He stood under the eaves of the forest, stooping forward, as if he were listening, and peering with wide eyes into the shadows. 'No, it is not evil; or what evil is in it is far away. I catch only the faintest echoes of dark places where the hearts of the trees are black. There is no malice near us; but there is watchfulness, and anger.'\n\n'Well, it has no cause to be angry with me,' said Gimli. 'I have done it no harm. '\n\n'That is just as well,' said Legolas. 'But nonetheless it has suffered harm. There is something happening inside, or going to happen. Do you not feel the tenseness? It takes my breath.'\n\n'I feel the air is stuffy,' said the Dwarf. 'This wood is lighter than Mirkwood, but it is musty and shabby.'\n\n'It is old, very old,' said the Elf. 'So old that almost I feel young again, as I have not felt since I journeyed with you children. It is old and full of memory. I could have been happy here, if I had come in days of peace.'\n\n'I dare say you could,' snorted Gimli. 'You are a Wood-elf, anyway, though Elves of any kind are strange folk. Yet you comfort me. Where you go, I will go. But keep your bow ready to hand, and I will keep my axe loose in my belt. Not for use on trees,' he added hastily, looking up at the tree under which they stood. 'I do not wish to meet that old man at unawares without an argument ready to hand, that is all. Let us go!'\n\nWith that the three hunters plunged into the forest of Fangorn. Legolas and Gimli left the tracking to Aragorn. There was little for him to see. The floor of the forest was dry and covered with a drift of leaves; but guessing that the fugitives would stay near the water, he returned often to the banks of the stream. So it was that he came upon the place where Merry and Pippin had drunk and bathed their feet. There plain for all to see were the footprints of two hobbits, one somewhat smaller than the other.\n\n'This is good tidings,' said Aragorn. 'Yet the marks are two days old, and it seems that at this point the hobbits left the water-side.'\n\n'Then what shall we do now?' said Gimli. 'We cannot pursue them through the whole fastness of Fangorn. We have come ill supplied. If we do not find them soon, we shall be of no use to them, except to sit down beside them and show our friendship by starving together.'\n\n'If that is indeed all we can do, then we must do that,' said Aragorn. 'Let us go on.'\n\nThey came at length to the steep abrupt end of Treebeard's Hill and looked up at the rock-wall with its rough steps leading to the high shelf. Gleams of sun were striking through the hurrying clouds, and the forest now looked less grey and drear.\n\n'Let us go up and look about us!' said Legolas. 'I will feel my breath short. I should like to taste a freer air for a while.'\n\nThe companions climbed up. Aragorn came last, moving slowly: he was scanning the steps and ledges closely.\n\n'I am almost sure that the hobbits have been up here,' he said. 'But there are other marks, very strange marks, which I do not understand. I wonder if we can see anything from this ledge which will help us to guess which way they went next?'\n\nHe stood up and looked about, but he saw nothing that was of any use. The shelf faced southward and eastward; but only on the east was the view open. There he could see the heads of the trees descending in ranks towards the plain from which they had come.\n\n'We have journeyed a long way round,' said Legolas. 'We could have all come here safe together, if we had left the Great River on the second or third day and struck west. Few can foresee whither their road will lead them, till they come to its end.'\n\n'But we did not wish to come to Fangorn,' said Gimli.\n\n'Yet here we are \u0426 and nicely caught in the net,' said Legolas. 'Look!'\n\n'Look at what?' said Gimli.\n\n'There in the trees.'\n\n'Where? I have not elf-eyes.'\n\n'Hush! Speak more softly! Look!' said Legolas pointing. 'Down in the wood, back in the Way that we have just come. It is he. Cannot you see him, passing from tree to tree?'\n\n'I see, I see now!' hissed Gimli. 'Look, Aragorn! Did I not warn you? There is the old man. All in dirty grey rags: that is why I could not see him at first.'\n\nAragorn looked and beheld a bent figure moving slowly. It was not far away. It looked like an old beggar-man, walking wearily, leaning on a rough staff. His head was bowed, and he did not look towards them. In other lands they would have greeted him with kind words; but now they stood silent, each feeling a strange expectancy: something was approaching that held a hidden power \u0426 or menace.\n\nGimli gazed with wide eyes for a while, as step by step the figure drew nearer. Then suddenly, unable to contain himself longer, he burst out: 'Your bow, Legolas! Bend it! Get ready! It is Saruman. Do not let him speak, or put a spell upon us! Shoot first!'\n\nLegolas took his bow and bent it, slowly and as if some other will resisted him. He held an arrow loosely in his hand but did not fit it to the string. Aragorn stood silent, his face was watchful and intent.\n\n'Why are you waiting? What is the matter with you?' said Gimli in a hissing whisper.\n\n'Legolas is right,' said Aragorn quietly. 'We may not shoot an old man so, at unawares and unchallenged, whatever fear or doubt be on us. Watch and wait!'\n\nAt that moment the old man quickened his pace and came with surprising speed to the foot of the rock-wall. Then suddenly he looked up, while they stood motionless looking down. There was no sound.\n\nThey could not see his face: he was hooded, and above the hood he wore a wide-brimmed hat, so that all his features were over-shadowed, except for the end of his nose and his grey beard. Yet it seemed to Aragorn that he caught the gleam of eyes keen and bright from within the shadow of the hooded brows.\n\nAt last the old man broke the silence. 'Well met indeed, my friends,' he said in a soft voice. 'I wish to speak to you. Will you come down or shall I come up?' Without waiting for an answer he began to climb.\n\n'Now!' said Gimli. 'Stop him, Legolas!'\n\n'Did I not say that I wished to speak to you?' said the old man. 'Put away that bow, Master Elf!'\n\nThe bow and arrow fell from Legolas' hands, and his arms hung loose at his sides.\n\n'And you, Master Dwarf, pray take your hand from your axe-haft, till I am up! You will not need such arguments.'\n\nGimli started and then stood still as stone, staring, while the old man sprang up the rough steps as nimbly as a goat. All weariness seemed to have left him. As he stepped up on to the shelf there was a gleam, too brief for certainty, a quick glint of white, as if some garment shrouded by the grey rags had been for an instant revealed The intake of Gimli's breath could be heard as a loud hiss in the silence.\n\n'Well met, I say again!' said the old man, coming towards them. When he was a few feet away, he stood, stooping over his staff, with his head thrust forward, peering at them from under his hood. 'And what may you be doing in these parts? An Elf, a Man, and a Dwarf, all clad in elvish fashion. No doubt there is a tale worth hearing behind it all. Such things are not often seen here.'\n\n'You speak as one that knows Fangorn well,' said Aragorn. 'Is that so?'\n\n'Not well,' said the old man, 'that would be the study of many lives. But I come here now and again.'\n\n'Might we know your name, and then hear what it is that you have to say to us?' said Aragorn. 'The morning passes, and we have an errand that will not wait.'\n\n'As for what I wished to say, I have said it: what may you be doing, and what tale can you tell of yourselves? As for my name!' He broke off, laughing long and softly. Aragorn felt a shudder run through him at the sound, a strange cold thrill; and yet it was not fear or terror that he felt: rather it was like the sudden bite of a keen air, or the slap of a cold rain that wakes an uneasy sleeper.\n\n'My name!' said the old man again. 'Have you not guessed it already? You have heard it before, I think. Yes, you have heard it before. But come now, what of your tale?'\n\nThe three companions stood silent and made no answer.\n\n'There are some who would begin to doubt whether your errand is fit to tell,' said the old man. 'Happily I know something of it. You are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits, I believe. Yes, hobbits. Don't stare, as if you had never heard the strange name before. You have, and so have I. Well, they climbed up here the day before yesterday; and they met someone that they did not expect. Does that comfort you? And now you would like to know where they were taken? Well, well, maybe I can give you some news about that. But why are we standing? Your errand, you see, is no longer as urgent as you thought. Let us sit down and be more at ease.'\n\nThe old man turned away and went towards a heap of fallen stones and rock at the foot of the cliff behind. Immediately, as if a spell had been removed, the others relaxed and stirred. Gimli's hand went at once to his axe-haft. Aragorn drew his sword. Legolas picked up his bow.\n\nThe old man took no notice, but stooped and sat himself on a low flat stone. Then his grey cloak drew apart, and they saw, beyond doubt, that he was clothed beneath all in white.\n\n'Saruman!' cried Gimli, springing towards him with axe in hand. 'Speak! Tell us where you have hidden our friends! What have you done with them? Speak, or I will make a dint in your hat that even a wizard will find it hard to deal with!'\n\nThe old man was too quick for him. He sprang to his feet and leaped to the top of a large rock. There he stood, grown suddenly tall, towering above them. His hood and his grey rags were flung away. His white garments shone. He lifted up his staff, and Gimli's axe leaped from his grasp and fell ringing on the ground. The sword of Aragorn, stiff in his motionless hand, blazed with a sudden fire. Legolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high into the air: it vanished in a flash of flame.\n\n'Mithrandir!' he cried. 'Mithrandir!'\n\n'Well met, I say to you again, Legolas!' said the old man.\n\nThey all gazed at him. His hair was white as snow in the sunshine; and gleaming white was his robe; the eyes under his deep brows were bright, piercing as the rays of the sun; power was in his hand. Between wonder, joy, and fear they stood and found no words to say.\n\nAt last Aragorn stirred. 'Gandalf!' he said. 'Beyond all hope you return to us in our need! What veil was over my sight? Gandalf!' Gimli said nothing, but sank to his knees, shading his eyes.\n\n'Gandalf,' the old man repeated, as if recalling from old memory a long disused word. 'Yes, that was the name. I was Gandalf.'\n\nHe stepped down from the rock, and picking up his grey cloak wrapped it about him: it seemed as if the sun had been shining, but now was hid in cloud again. 'Yes, you may still call me Gandalf,' he said, and the voice was the voice of their old friend and guide. 'Get up, my good Gimli! No blame to you, and no harm done to me. Indeed my friends, none of you have any weapon that could hurt me. Be merry! We meet again. At the turn of the tide. The great storm is coming, but the tide has turned.'\n\nHe laid his hand on Gimli's head, and the Dwarf looked up and laughed suddenly. 'Gandalf!' he said. 'But you are all in white!'\n\n'Yes, I am white now,' said Gandalf. 'Indeed I am Saruman, one might almost say, Saruman as he should have been. But come now, tell me of yourselves! I have passed through fire and deep water, since we parted. I have forgotten much that I thought I knew, and learned again much that I had forgotten. I can see many things far off, but many things that are close at hand I cannot see. Tell me of yourselves!'\n\n'What do you wish to know?' said Aragorn. 'All that has happened since we parted on the bridge would be a long tale. Will you not first give us news of the hobbits? Did you find them, and are they safe?'\n\n'No, I did not find them,' said Gandalf. 'There was a darkness over the valleys of the Emyn Muil, and I did not know of their captivity, until the eagle told me.'\n\n'The eagle!' said Legolas. 'I have seen an eagle high and far off: the last time was three days ago, above the Emyn Muil.'\n\n'Yes,' said Gandalf, 'that was Gwaihir the Windlord, who rescued me from Orthanc. I sent him before me to watch the River and gather tidings. His sight is keen, but he cannot see all that passes under hill and tree. Some things he has seen, and others I have seen myself. The Ring now has passed beyond my help, or the help of any of the Company that set out from Rivendell. Very nearly it was revealed to the Enemy, but it escaped. I had some part in that: for I sat in a high place, and I strove with the Dark Tower; and the Shadow passed. Then I was weary, very weary; and I walked long in dark thought.'\n\n'Then you know about Frodo!' said Gimli. 'How do things go with him?'\n\n'I cannot say. He was saved from a great peril, but many lie before him still. He resolved to go alone to Mordor, and he set out: that is all that I can say.'\n\n'Not alone,' said Legolas. 'We think that Sam went with him.'\n\n'Did he!' said Gandalf, and there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on his face. 'Did he indeed? It is news to me, yet it does not surprise me. Good! Very good! You lighten my heart. You must tell me more. Now sit by me and tell me the tale of your journey.'\n\nThe companions sat on the ground at his feet, and Aragorn took up the tale. For a long while Gandalf said nothing, and he asked no questions. His hands were spread upon his knees, and his eyes were closed. At last when Aragorn spoke of the death of Boromir and of his last journey upon the Great River, the old man sighed.\n\n'You have not said all that you know or guess, Aragorn my friend,' he said quietly. 'Poor Boromir! I could not see what happened to him. It was a sore trial for such a man: a warrior, and a lord of men. Galadriel told me that he was in peril. But he escaped in the end. I am glad. It was not in vain that the young hobbits came with us, if only for Boromir's sake. But that is not the only part they have to play. They were brought to Fangorn, and their coming was like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains. Even as we talk here, I hear the first rumblings. Saruman had best not be caught away from home when the dam bursts!'\n\n'In one thing you have not changed, dear friend,' said Aragorn: 'you still speak in riddles.'\n\n'What? In riddles?' said Gandalf. 'No! For I was talking aloud to myself. A habit of the old: they choose the wisest person present to speak to; the long explanations needed by the young are wearying.' He laughed, but the sound now seemed warm and kindly as a gleam of sunshine.\n\n'I am no longer young even in the reckoning of Men of the Ancient Houses,' said Aragorn. 'Will you not open your mind more clearly to me?'\n\n'What then shall I say?' said Gandalf, and paused for a while in thought. 'This in brief is how I see things at the moment, if you wish to have a piece of my mind as plain as possible. The Enemy, of course, has long known that the Ring is abroad, and that it is borne by a hobbit. He knows now the number of our Company that set out from Rivendell, and the kind of each of us. But he does not yet perceive our purpose clearly. He supposes that we were all going to Minas Tirith; for that is what he would himself have done in our place. And according to his wisdom it would have been a heavy stroke against his power. Indeed he is in great fear, not knowing what mighty one may suddenly appear, wielding the Ring, and assailing him with war, seeking to cast him down and take his place. That we should wish to cast him down and have no one in his place is not a thought that occurs to his mind. That we should try to destroy the Ring itself has not yet entered into his darkest dream. In which no doubt you will see our good fortune and our hope. For imagining war he has let loose war, believing that he has no time to waste; for he that strikes the first blow, if he strikes it hard enough, may need to strike no more. So the forces that he has long been preparing he is now setting in motion, sooner than he intended. Wise fool. For if he had used all his power to guard Mordor, so that none could enter, and bent all his guild to the hunting of the Ring, then indeed hope would have faded: neither Ring nor Bearer could long have eluded him. But now his eye gazes abroad rather than near at home; and mostly he looks towards Minas Tirith. Very soon now his strength will fall upon it like a storm.\n\n'For already he knows that the messengers that he sent to waylay the Company have failed again. They have not found the Ring. Neither have they brought away any hobbits as hostages. Had they done even so much as that, it would have been a heavy blow to us, and it might have been fatal. But let us not darken our hearts by imagining the trial of their gentle loyalty in the Dark Tower. For the Enemy has failed \u0426 so far. Thanks to Saruman:'\n\n'Then is not Saruman a traitor?' said Gimli.\n\n'Indeed yes,' said Gandalf. 'Doubly. And is not that strange? Nothing that we have endured of late has seemed so grievous as the treason of Isengard. Even reckoned as a lord and captain Saruman has grown very strong. He threatens the Men of Rohan and draws off their help from Minas Tirith, even as the main blow is approaching from the East. Yet a treacherous weapon is ever a danger to the hand. Saruman also had a mind to capture the Ring, for himself, or at least to snare some hobbits for his evil purposes. So between them our enemies have contrived only to bring Merry and Pippin with marvellous speed, and in the nick of time, to Fangorn, where otherwise they would never have come at all!\n\n'Also they have filled themselves with new doubts that disturb their plans. No tidings of the battle will come to Mordor, thanks to the horsemen of Rohan; but the Dark Lord knows that two hobbits were taken in the Emyn Muil and borne away towards Isengard against the will of his own servants. He now has Isengard to fear as well as Minas Tirith. If Minas Tirith falls, it will go ill with Saruman.'\n\n'It is a pity that our friends lie in between,' said Gimli. 'If no land divided Isengard and Mordor, then they could fight while we watched and waited.'\n\n'The victor would emerge stronger than either, and free from doubt,' said Gandalf. 'But Isengard cannot fight Mordor, unless Saruman first obtains the Ring. That he will never do now. He does not yet know his peril. There is much that he does not know. He was so eager to lay his hands on his prey that he could not wait at home, and he came forth to meet and to spy on his messengers. But he came too late, for once, and the battle was over and beyond his help before he reached these parts. He did not remain here long. I look into his mind and I see his doubt. He has no woodcraft. He believes that the horsemen slew and burned all upon the field of battle; but he does not know whether the Orcs were bringing any prisoners or not. And he does not know of the quarrel between his servants and the Orcs of Mordor; nor does he know of the Winged Messenger.'\n\n'The Winged Messenger!' cried Legolas. 'I shot at him with the bow of Galadriel above Sarn Gebir, and I felled him from the sky. He filled us all with fear. What new terror is this?'\n\n'One that you cannot slay with arrows,' said Gandalf. 'You only slew his steed. It was a good deed; but the Rider was soon horsed again. For he was a Nazgul, one of the Nine, who ride now upon winged steeds. Soon their terror will overshadow the last armies of our friends, cutting off the sun. But they have not yet been allowed to cross the River, and Saruman does not know of this new shape in which the Ringwraiths have been clad. His thought is ever on the Ring. Was it present in the battle? Was it found? What if Theoden, Lord of the Mark, should come by it and learn of its power? That is the danger that he sees, and he has fled back to Isengard to double and treble his assault on Rohan. And all the time there is another danger, close at hand, which he does not see, busy with his fiery thoughts. He has forgotten Treebeard.'\n\n'Now you speak to yourself again,' said Aragorn with a smile. 'Treebeard is not known to me. And I have guessed part of Saruman's double treachery; yet I do not see in what way the coming of two hobbits to Fangorn has served, save to give us a long and fruitless chase.'\n\n'Wait a minute!' cried Gimli. 'There is another thing that I should like to know first. Was it you, Gandalf, or Saruman that we saw last night?'\n\n'You certainly did not see me,' answered Gandalf, 'therefore I must guess that you saw Saruman. Evidently we look so much alike that your desire to make an incurable dent in my hat must be excused.'\n\n'Good, good!' said Gimli. 'I am glad that it was not you.'\n\nGandalf laughed again. 'Yes, my good Dwarf,' he said, 'it is a comfort not to be mistaken at all points. Do I not know it only too well! But, of course, I never blamed you for your welcome of me. How could I do so, who have so often counselled my friends to suspect even their own hands when dealing with the Enemy. Bless you, Gimli, son of Gloin! Maybe you will see us both together one day and judge between us!'\n\n'But the hobbits!' Legolas broke in. 'We have come far to seek them, and you seem to know where they are. Where are they now?'\n\n'With Treebeard and the Ents,' said Gandalf.\n\n'The Ents!' exclaimed Aragorn. 'Then there is truth in the old legends about the dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds of the trees? Are there still Ents in the world? I thought they were only a memory of ancient days, if indeed they were ever more than a legend of Rohan.'\n\n'A legend of Rohan!' cried Legolas. 'Nay, every Elf in Wilderland has sung songs of the old Onodrim and their long sorrow. Yet even among us they are only a memory. If I were to meet one still walking in this world, then indeed I should feel young again! But Treebeard: that is only a rendering of Fangorn into the Common Speech; yet you seem to speak of a person. Who is this Treebeard?'\n\n'Ah! now you are asking much,' said Gandalf. 'The little that I know of his long slow story would make a tale for which we have no time now. Treebeard is Fangorn, the guardian of the forest; he is the oldest of the Ents, the oldest living thing that still walks beneath the Sun upon this Middle-earth. I hope indeed, Legolas, that you may yet meet him. Merry and Pippin have been fortunate: they met him here, even where we sit. For he came here two days ago and bore them away to his dwelling far off by the roots of the mountains. He often comes here, especially when his mind is uneasy, and rumours of the world outside trouble him. I saw him four days ago striding among the trees, and I think he saw me, for he paused; but I did not speak, for I was heavy with thought, and weary after my struggle with the Eye of Mordor; and he did not speak either, nor call my name.'\n\n'Perhaps he also thought that you were Saruman,' said Gimli. 'But you speak of him as if he was a friend. I thought Fangorn was dangerous.'\n\n'Dangerous!' cried Gandalf. 'And so am I, very dangerous: more dangerous than anything you will ever meet, unless you are brought alive before the seat of the Dark Lord. And Aragorn is dangerous, and Legolas is dangerous. You are beset with dangers, Gimli son of Gloin; for you are dangerous yourself, in your own fashion. Certainly the forest of Fangorn is perilous-not least to those that are too ready with their axes; and Fangorn himself, he is perilous too; yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless. But now his long slow wrath is brimming over, and all the forest is filled with it. The coming of the hobbits and the tidings that they brought have spilled it: it will soon be running like a flood; but its tide is turned against Saruman and the axes of Isengard. A thing is about to happen which has not happened since the Elder Days: the Ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong.'\n\n'What will they do?' asked Legolas in astonishment.\n\n'I do not know,' said Gandalf. 'I do not think they know themselves. I wonder.' He fell silent, his head bowed in thought.\n\nThe others looked at him. A gleam of sun through fleeting clouds fell on his hands, which lay now upturned on his lap: they seemed to be filled with light as a cup is with water. At last he looked up and gazed straight at the sun.\n\n'The morning is wearing away,' he said. 'Soon we must go.'\n\n'Do we go to find our friends and to see Treebeard?' asked Aragorn.\n\n'No,' said Gandalf. 'That is not the road that you must take. I have spoken words of hope. But only of hope. Hope is not victory. War is upon us and all our friends, a war in which only the use of the Ring could give us surety of victory. It fills me with great sorrow and great fear: for much shall be destroyed and all may be lost. I am Gandalf, Gandalf the White, but Black is mightier still.'\n\nHe rose and gazed out eastward, shading his eyes, as if he saw things far away that none of them could see. Then he shook his head. 'No,' he said in a soft voice, 'it has gone beyond our reach. Of that at least let us be glad. We can no longer be tempted to use the Ring. We must go down to face a peril near despair, yet that deadly peril is removed.'\n\nHe turned. 'Come, Aragorn son of Arathorn!' he said. 'Do not regret your choice in the valley of the Emyn Muil, nor call it a vain pursuit. You chose amid doubts the path that seemed right: the choice was just, and it has been rewarded. For so we have met in time, who otherwise might have met too late. But the quest of your companions is over. Your next journey is marked by your given word. You must go to Edoras and seek out Theoden in his hall. For you are needed. The light of Anduril must now be uncovered in the battle for which it has so long waited. There is war in Rohan, and worse evil: it goes ill with Theoden.'\n\n'Then are we not to see the merry young hobbits again?' said Legolas.\n\n'I did not say so,' said Gandalf. 'Who knows? Have patience. Go where you must go, and hope! To Edoras! I go thither also.'\n\n'It is a long way for a man to walk, young or old,' said Aragorn. 'I fear the battle will be over long ere I come there.'\n\n'We shall see, we shall see,' said Gandalf. 'Will you come now with me?'\n\n'Yes, we will set out together,' said Aragorn. 'But I do not doubt that you will come there before me, if you wish.' He rose and looked long at Gandalf. The others gazed at them in silence as they stood there facing one another. The grey figure of the Man, Aragorn son of Arathorn, was tall, and stern as stone, his hand upon the hilt of his sword; he looked as if some king out of the mists of the sea had stepped upon the shores of lesser men. Before him stooped the old figure, white; shining now as if with some light kindled within, bent, laden with years, but holding a power beyond the strength of kings.\n\n'Do I not say truly, Gandalf,' said Aragorn at last, 'that you could go whithersoever you wished quicker than I? And this I also say: you are our captain and our banner. The Dark Lord has Nine. But we have One, mightier than they: the White Rider. He has passed through the fire and the abyss, and they shall fear him. We will go where he leads.'\n\n'Yes, together we will follow you,' said Legolas. 'But first, it would ease my heart, Gandalf, to hear what befell you in Moria. Will you not tell us? Can you not stay even to tell your friends how you were delivered?'\n\n'I have stayed already too long,' answered Gandalf. 'Time is short. But if there were a year to spend, I would not tell you all.'\n\n'Then tell us what you will, and time allows!' said Gimli. 'Come, Gandalf, tell us how you fared with the Balrog!'\n\n'Name him not!' said Gandalf, and for a moment it seemed that a cloud of pain passed over his face, and he sat silent, looking old as death. 'Long time I fell,' he said at last, slowly, as if thinking back with difficulty. 'Long I fell, and he fell with me. His fire was about me. I was burned. Then we plunged into the deep water and all was dark. Cold it was as the tide of death: almost it froze my heart.'\n\n'Deep is the abyss that is spanned by Durin's Bridge, and none has measured it,' said Gimli.\n\n'Yet it has a bottom, beyond light and knowledge,' said Gandalf. 'Thither I came at last, to the uttermost foundations of stone. He was with me still. His fire was quenched, but now he was a thing of slime, stronger than a strangling snake.\n\n'We fought far under the living earth, where time is not counted. Ever he clutched me, and ever I hewed him, till at last he fled into dark tunnels. They were not made by Durin's folk, Gimli son of Gloin. Far, far below the deepest delving of the Dwarves, the world is gnawed by nameless things. Even Sauron knows them not. They are older than he. Now I have walked there, but I will bring no report to darken the light of day. In that despair my enemy was my only hope, and I pursued him, clutching at his heel. Thus he brought me back at last to the secret ways of Khazad-dum: too well he knew them all. Ever up now we went, until we came to the Endless Stair.'\n\n'Long has that been lost,' said Gimli. 'Many have said that it was never made save in legend, but others say that it was destroyed.'\n\n'It was made, and it had not been destroyed,' said Gandalf. 'From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak it climbed, ascending in unbroken spiral in many thousand steps, until it issued at last in Durin's Tower carved in the living rock of Zirak-zigil, the pinnacle of the Silvertine.\n\n'There upon Celebdil was a lonely window in the snow, and before it lay a narrow space, a dizzy eyrie above the mists of the world. The sun shone fiercely there, but all below was wrapped in cloud. Out he sprang, and even as I came behind, he burst into new flame. There was none to see, or perhaps in after ages songs would still be sung of the Battle of the Peak.' Suddenly Gandalf laughed. 'But what would they say in song? Those that looked up from afar thought that the mountain was crowned with storm. Thunder they heard, and lightning, they said, smote upon Celebdil, and leaped back broken into tongues of fire. Is not that enough? A great smoke rose about us, vapour and steam. Ice fell like rain. I threw down my enemy, and he fell from the high place and broke the mountain-side where he smote it in his ruin. Then darkness took me; and I strayed out of thought and time, and I wandered far on roads that I will not tell.\n\n'Naked I was sent back \u0426 for a brief time, until my task is done. And naked I lay upon the mountain-top. The tower behind was crumbled into dust, the window gone; the ruined stair was choked with burned and broken stone. I was alone, forgotten, without escape upon the hard horn of the world. There I lay staring upward, while the stars wheeled over, and each day was as long as a life-age of the earth. Faint to my ears came the gathered rumour of all lands: the springing and the dying, the song and the weeping, and the slow everlasting groan of overburdened stone. And so at the last Gwaihir the Windlord found me again, and he took me up and bore me away.\n\n'\"Ever am I fated to be your burden, friend at need,\" I said.\n\n'\"A burden you have been,\" he answered, \"but not so now. Light as a swan's feather in my claw you are. The Sun shines through you. Indeed I do not think you need me any more: were I to let you fall you would float upon the wind.\"\n\n'\"Do not let me fall!\" I gasped, for I felt life in me again. \"Bear me to Lothlorien!\"\n\n'\"That indeed is the command of the Lady Galadriel who sent me to look for you,\" he answered.\n\n'Thus it was that I came to Caras Galadhon and found you but lately gone. I tarried there in the ageless time of that land where days bring healing not decay. Healing I found, and I was clothed in white. Counsel I gave and counsel took. Thence by strange roads I came, and messages I bring to some of you. To Aragorn I was bidden to say this:\n\n\t\tWhere now are the Dunedain, Elessar, Elessar?\n\t\tWhy do thy kinsfolk wander afar?\n\t\tNear is the hour when the Lost should come forth,\n\t\tAnd the Grey Company ride from the North.\n\t\tBut dark is the path appointed for thee:\n\t\tThe Dead watch the road that leads to the Sea.\n\nTo Legolas she sent this word:\n\n\t\tLegolas Greenleaf long under tree\n\t\tIn joy thou hast lived. Beware of the Sea!\n\t\tIf thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore,\n\t\tThy heart shall then rest in the forest no more.\n\nGandalf fell silent and shut his eyes.\n\n'Then she sent me no message?' said Gimli and bent his head.\n\n'Dark are her words,' said Legolas, 'and little do they mean to those that receive them.'\n\n'That is no comfort,' said Gimli.\n\n'What then?' said Legolas. 'Would you have her speak openly to you of your death?'\n\n'Yes. if she had nought else to say.'\n\n'What is that?' said Gandalf, opening his eyes. 'Yes, I think I can guess what her words may mean. Your pardon, Gimli! I was pondering the messages once again. But indeed she sent words to you, and neither dark nor sad.\n\n'\"To Gimli son of Gloin,\" she said, \"give his Lady's greeting. Lock-bearer, wherever thou goest my thought goes with thee. But have a care to lay thine axe to the right tree!\"'\n\n'In happy hour you have returned to us, Gandalf,' cried the Dwarf, capering as he sang loudly in the strange dwarf-tongue. 'Come, come!' he shouted, swinging his axe. 'Since Gandalf's head is now sacred, let us find one that it is right to cleave!'\n\n'That will not be far to seek,' said Gandalf, rising from his seat. 'Come! We have spent all the time that is allowed to a meeting of parted friends. Now there is need of haste.'\n\nHe wrapped himself again in his old tattered cloak, and led the way. Following him they descended quickly from the high shelf and made their way back through the forest, down the bank of the Entwash. They spoke no more words, until they stood again upon the grass beyond the eaves of Fangorn. There was no sign of their horses to be seen.\n\n'They have not returned,' said Legolas. 'It will be a weary walk!'\n\n'I shall not walk. Time presses,' said Gandalf. Then lifting up his head he gave a long whistle. So clear and piercing was the note that the others stood amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lips. Three times he whistled; and then faint and far off it seemed to them that they heard the whinny of a horse borne up from the plains upon the eastern wind. They waited wondering. Before long there came the sound of hoofs, at first hardly more than a tremor of the ground perceptible only to Aragorn as he lay upon the grass, then growing steadily louder and clearer to a quick beat.\n\n'There is more than one horse coming,' said Aragorn.\n\n'Certainly,' said Gandalf. 'We are too great a burden for one.'\n\n'There are three,' said Legolas, gazing out over the plain. 'See how they run! There is Hasufel, and there is my friend Arod beside him! But there is another that strides ahead: a very great horse. I have not seen his like before.'\n\n'Nor will you again,' said Gandalf. 'That is Shadowfax. He is the chief of the Mearas, lords of horses, and not even Theoden, King of Rohan, has ever looked on a better. Does he not shine like silver, and run as smoothly as a swift stream? He has come for me: the horse of the White Rider. We are going to battle together.'\n\nEven as the old wizard spoke, the great horse came striding up the slope towards them; his coat was glistening and his mane flowing in the wind of his speed. The two others followed, now far behind. As soon as Shadowfax saw Gandalf, he checked his pace and whinnied loudly; then trotting gently forward he stooped his proud head and nuzzled his great nostrils against the old man's neck.\n\nGandalf caressed him. 'It is a long way from Rivendell, my friend,' he said, 'but you are wise and swift and come at need. Far let us ride now together, and part not in this world again!'\n\nSoon the other horses came up and stood quietly by, as if awaiting orders. 'We go at once to Meduseld, the hall of your master, Theoden,' said Gandalf, addressing them gravely. They bowed their heads. 'Time presses, so with your leave, my friends, we will ride. We beg you to use all the speed that you can. Hasufel shall bear Aragorn and Arod Legolas. I will set Gimli before me, and by his leave Shadowfax shall bear us both. We will wait now only to drink a little.'\n\n'Now I understand a part of last night's riddle,' said Legolas as he sprang lightly upon Arod's back. 'Whether they fled at first in fear, or not, our horses met Shadowfax, their chieftain, and greeted him with joy. Did you know that he was at hand, Gandalf?'\n\n'Yes, I knew,' said the wizard. 'I bent my thought upon him, bidding him to make haste; for yesterday he was far away in the south of this land. Swiftly may he bear me back again!'\n\nGandalf spoke now to Shadowfax, and the horse set off at a good pace, yet not beyond the measure of the others. After a little while he turned suddenly, and choosing a place where the banks were lower, he waded the river, and then led them away due south into a flat land, treeless and wide. The wind went like grey waves through the endless miles of grass. There was no sign of road or track, but Shadowfax did not stay or falter.\n\n'He is steering a straight course now for the halls of Theoden under the slopes of the White Mountains,' said Gandalf. 'It will be quicker so. The ground is firmer in the Eastemnet, where the chief northward track lies, across the river, but Shadowfax knows the way through every fen and hollow.'\n\nFor many hours they rode on through the meads and riverlands. Often the grass was so high that it reached above the knees of the riders, and their steeds seemed to be swimming in a grey-green sea. They came upon many hidden pools, and broad acres of sedge waving above wet and treacherous bogs; but Shadowfax found the way, and the other horses followed in his swath. Slowly the sun fell from the sky down into the West. Looking out over the great plain, far away the riders saw it for a moment like a red fire sinking into the grass. Low upon the edge of sight shoulders of the mountains glinted red upon either side. A smoke seemed to rise up and darken the sun's disc to the hue of blood, as if it had kindled the grass as it passed down under the rim of earth.\n\n'There lies the Gap of Rohan,' said Gandalf. 'It is now almost due west of us. That way lies Isengard.'\n\n'I see a great smoke,' said Legolas. 'What may that be?'\n\n'Battle and war!' said Gandalf. 'Ride on!'\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nThe King of the Golden Hall\n\nThey rode on through sunset, and slow dusk, and gathering night. When at last they halted and dismounted, even Aragorn was stiff and weary. Gandalf only allowed them a few hours' rest. Legolas and Gimli slept and Aragorn lay flat, stretched upon his back; but Gandalf stood, leaning on his staff, gazing into the darkness, east and west. All was silent, and there was no sign or sound of living thing. The night was barred with long clouds, fleeting on a chill wind, when they arose again. Under the cold moon they went on once more, as swift as by the light of day.\n\nHours passed and still they rode on. Gimli nodded and would have fallen from his seat, if Gandalf had not clutched and shaken him. Hasufel and Arod, weary but proud, followed their tireless leader, a grey shadow before them hardly to he seen. The miles went by. The waxing moon sank into the cloudy West.\n\nA bitter chill came into the air. Slowly in the East the dark faded to a cold grey. Red shafts of light leapt above the black walls of the Emyn Muil far away upon their left. Dawn came clear and bright; a wind swept across their path, rushing through the bent grasses. Suddenly Shadowfax stood still and neighed. Gandalf pointed ahead.\n\n'Look!' he cried, and they lifted their tired eyes. Before them stood the mountains of the South: white-tipped and streaked with black. The grass-lands rolled against the hills that clustered at their feet, and flowed up into many valleys still dim and dark, untouched by the light of dawn, winding their way into the heart of the great mountains. Immediately before the travellers the widest of these glens opened like a long gulf among the hills. Far inward they glimpsed a tumbled mountain-mass with one tall peak; at the mouth of the vale there stood like sentinel a lonely height. About its feet there flowed, as a thread of silver, the stream that issued from the dale; upon its brow they caught, still far away, a glint in the rising sun, a glimmer of gold. 'Speak, Legolas!' said Gandalf. 'Tell us what you see there before us!'\n\nLegolas gazed ahead, shading his eyes from the level shafts of the new-risen sun. 'I see a white stream that comes down from the snows,' he said. 'Where it issues from the shadow of the vale a green hill rises upon the east. A dike and mighty wall and thorny fence encircle it. Within there rise the roofs of houses; and in the midst, set upon a green terrace, there stands aloft a great hall of Men. And it seems to my eyes that it is thatched with gold. The light of it shines far over the land. Golden, too, are the posts of its doors. There men in bright mail stand; but all else within the courts are yet asleep.'\n\n'Edoras those courts are called,' said Gandalf, 'and Meduseld is that golden hall. There dwells Theoden son of Thengel, King of the Mark of Rohan. We are come with the rising of the day. Now the road lies plain to see before us. But we must ride more warily; for war is abroad, and the Rohirrim, the Horse-lords, do not sleep, even if it seem so from afar. Draw no weapon, speak no haughty word, I counsel you all, until we are come before Theoden's seat.'\n\nThe morning was bright and clear about them, and birds were singing, when the travellers came to the stream. It ran down swiftly into the plain, and beyond the feet of the hills turned across their path in a wide bend, flowing away east to feed the Entwash far off in its reed-choked beds. The land was green: in the wet meads and along the grassy borders of the stream grew many willow-trees. Already in this southern land they were blushing red at their fingertips, feeling the approach of spring. Over the stream there was a ford between low banks much trampled by the passage of horses. The travellers passed over and came upon a wide rutted track leading towards the uplands.\n\nAt the foot of the walled hill the way ran under the shadow of many mounds, high and green. Upon their western sides the grass was white as with a drifted snow: small flowers sprang there like countless stars amid the turf.\n\n'Look!' said Gandalf. 'How fair are the bright eyes in the grass! Evermind they are called, simbelmyne in this land of Men, for they blossom in all the seasons of the year, and grow where dead men rest. Behold! we are come to the great barrows where the sires of Theoden sleep.'\n\n'Seven mounds upon the left, and nine upon the right,' said Aragorn. 'Many long lives of men it is since the golden hall was built.'\n\n'Five hundred times have the red leaves fallen in Mirkwood in my home since then,' said Legolas, 'and but a little while does that seem to us.'\n\n'But to the Riders of the Mark it seems so long ago,' said Aragorn, 'that the raising of this house is but a memory of song, and the years before are lost in the mist of time. Now they call this land their home, their own, and their speech is sundered from their northern kin.' Then he began to chant softly in a slow tongue unknown to the Elf and Dwarf; yet they listened, for there was a strong music in it.\n\n'That, I guess, is the language of the Rohirrim,' said Legolas; 'for it is like to this land itself; rich and rolling in part, and else hard and stern as the mountains. But I cannot guess what it means, save that it is laden with the sadness of Mortal Men.'\n\n'It runs thus in the Common Speech,' said Aragorn, 'as near as I can make it.\n\n\t\tWhere now the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing?\n\t\tWhere is the helm and the hauberk, and the bright hair flowing?\n\t\tWhere is the hand on the harpstring, and the red fire glowing?\n\t\tWhere is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing?\n\t\tThey have passed like rain on the mountain, like a wind in the meadow;\n\t\tThe days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow.\n\t\tWho shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning,\n\t\tOr behold the flowing years from the Sea returning?\n\nThus spoke a forgotten poet long ago in Rohan, recalling how tall and fair was Eorl the Young, who rode down out of the North; and there were wings upon the feet of his steed, Felarof, father of horses. So men still sing in the evening.'\n\nWith these words the travellers passed the silent mounds. Following the winding way up the green shoulders of the hills, they came at last to the wide wind-swept walls and the gates of Edoras.\n\nThere sat many men in bright mail, who sprang at once to their feet and barred the way with spears. 'Stay, strangers here unknown!' they cried in the tongue of the Riddermark, demanding the names and errand of the strangers. Wonder was in their eyes but little friendliness; and they looked darkly upon Gandalf.\n\n'Well do I understand your speech,' he answered in the same language; 'yet few strangers do so. Why then do you not speak in the Common Tongue, as is the custom in the West, if you wish to be answered?'\n\n'It is the will of Theoden King that none should enter his gates, save those who know our tongue and are our friends,' replied one of the guards. 'None are welcome here in days of war but our own folk, and those that come from Mundburg in the land of Gondor. Who are you that come heedless over the plain thus strangely clad, riding horses like to our own horses? Long have we kept guard here, and we have watched you from afar. Never have we seen other riders so strange, nor any horse more proud than is one of these that bear you. He is One of the Mearas, unless our eyes are cheated by some spell. Say, are you not a wizard, some spy from Saruman, or phantoms of his craft? Speak now and be swift!'\n\n'We are no phantoms,' said Aragorn, 'nor do your eyes cheat you. For indeed these are your own horses that we ride, as you knew well are you asked, I guess. But seldom does thief ride home to the stable. Here are Hasufel and Arod, that Eomer, the Third Marshal of the Mark, lent to us, only two days ago. We bring them back now, even as we promised him. Has not Eomer then returned and given warning of our coming?'\n\nA troubled look came into the guard's eyes. 'Of Eomer I have naught to say,' he answered. 'If what you tell me is truth, then doubtless Theoden will have heard of it. Maybe your coming was not wholly unlooked-for. It is but two nights ago that Wormtongue came to us and said that by the will of Theoden no stranger should pass these gates.'\n\n'Wormtongue?' said Gandalf, looking sharply at the guard. 'Say no more! My errand is not to Wormtongue, but to the Lord of the Mark himself. I am in haste. Will you not go or send to say that we are come?' His eyes glinted under his deep brows as he bent his gaze upon the man.\n\n'Yes, I will go,' he answered slowly. 'But what names shall I report? And what shall I say of you? Old and weary you seem now, and yet you are fell and grim beneath, I deem.'\n\n'Well do you see and speak,' said the wizard. 'For I am Gandalf. I have returned. And behold! I too bring back a horse. Here is Shadowfax the Great, whom no other hand can tame. And here beside me is Aragorn son of Arathorn, the heir of Kings, and it is to Mundburg that he goes. Here also are Legolas the Elf and Gimli the Dwarf, our comrades. Go now and say to your master that we are at his gates and would have speech with him, if he will permit us to come into his hall.'\n\n'Strange names you give indeed! But I will report them as you bid and learn my master's will,' said the guard. 'Wait here a little while, and\u2020I will bring you such answer as seems good to him. Do not hope too much! These are dark days.' He went swiftly away, leaving the strangers in the watchful keeping of his comrades. After some time he returned. 'Follow me!' he said. 'Theoden gives you leave to enter; but any weapon that you bear; be it only a staff, you must leave on the threshold. The doorwardens will keep them.'\n\nThe dark gates were swung open. The travellers entered, walking in file behind their guide. They found a broad path, paved with hewn stones, now winding upward, now climbing in short flights of well-laid steps. Many houses built of wood and many dark doors they passed. Beside the way in a stone channel a stream of clear water flowed, sparkling and chattering. At length they came to the crown of the hill. There stood a high platform above a green terrace, at the foot of which a bright spring gushed from a stone carved in the likeness of a horse's head; beneath was a wide basin from which the water. spilled and fed the falling stream. Up the green terrace went a stair of stone, high and broad, and on either side of the topmost step were stone-hewn sea, There sat other guards, with drawn swords laid upon their knees. Their golden hair was braided on their shoulders the sun was blazoned upon their green shields, their long corslets were burnished bright, and when they rose taller they seemed than mortal men.\n\n'There are the doors before you,' said the guide. 'I must return now to my duty at the gate. Farewell! And may the Lord of the Mark be gracious to you!'\n\nHe turned and went swiftly back down the road. The others climbed the long stair under the eyes of the tall watchmen. Silent they stood now above and spoke no word, until Gandalf stepped out upon the paved terrace at the stairs head. Then suddenly with clear voices they spoke a courteous greeting in their own tongue.\n\n'Hail, comers from afar!' they said, and they turned the hilts of their swords towards the travellers in token of peace. Green gems flashed in the sunlight. Then one of the guards stepped forward and spoke in the Common Speech.\n\n'I am the Doorward of Theoden,' he said. 'Hama is my name. Here I must bid you lay aside your weapons before you enter.'\n\nThen Legolas gave into his hand his silver-hafted knife, his quiver and his bow. 'Keep these well,' he said, 'for they come from the Golden Wood and the Lady of Lothlorien gave them to me.'\n\nWonder came into the man's eyes, and he laid the weapons hastily by the wall, as if he feared to handle them. 'No man will touch them I promise you,' he said.\n\nAragorn stood a while hesitating. 'It is not my will,' he said, 'to put aside my sword or to deliver Anduril to the hand of any other man.'\n\n'It is the will of Theoden,' said Hama.\n\n'It is not clear to me that the will of Theoden son of Thengel even though he be lord of the Mark, should prevail over the will of Aragorn son of Arathorn, Elendil's heir of Gondor.'\n\n'This is the house of Theoden, not of Aragorn, even were he King of Gondor in the seat of Denethor,' said Hama, stepping swiftly before the doors and barring the way. His sword was now in his hand and the point towards the strangers.\n\n'This is idle talk,' said Gandalf. 'Needless is Theoden's demand, but it is useless to refuse. A king will have his way in his own hall, be it folly or wisdom.'\n\n'Truly,' said Aragorn. 'And I would do as the master of the house bade me, were this only a woodman's cot, if I bore now any sword but Anduril.'\n\n'Whatever its name may be,' said Hama, 'here you shall lay it, if you would not fight alone against all the men in Edoras.'\n\n'Not alone!' said Gimli, fingering the blade of his axe, and looking darkly up at the guard, as if he were a young tree that Gimli had a mind to fell. 'Not alone!'\n\n'Come, come!' said Gandalf. 'We are all friends here. Or should be; for the laughter of Mordor will be our only reward, if we quarrel. My errand is pressing. Here at least is my sword, goodman Hama. Keep it well. Glamdring it is called, for the Elves made it long ago. Now let me pass. Come, Aragorn!'\n\nSlowly Aragorn unbuckled his belt and himself set his sword upright against the wall. 'Here I set it,' he said, 'but I command you not to touch it, nor to permit any other to lay hand on it. In this elvish heath dwells the Blade that was Broken and has been made again. Telchar first wrought it in the deeps of time. Death shall come to any man that draws Elendil's sword save Elendil's heir.'\n\nThe guard stepped back and looked with amazement on Aragorn. 'It seems that you are come on the wings of song out of the forgotten days he said. It shall be, lord, as you command.'\n\n'Well,' said Gimli, 'if it has Anduril to keep it company, my axe may stay here, too, without shame,' and he laid it on the floor. 'Now then, if all is as you wish, let us go and speak with your master.'\n\nThe guard still hesitated. 'Your staff,' he said to Gandalf. 'Forgive me, but that too must be left at the doors.'\n\n'Foolishness!' said Gandalf. 'Prudence is one thing, but discourtesy is another. I am old. If I may not lean on my stick as I go, then I will sit out here, until it pleases Theoden to hobble out himself to speak with me.'\n\nAragorn laughed. 'Every man has something too dear to trust to another. But would you part an old man from his support? Come, will you not let us enter?'\n\n'The staff in the hand of a wizard may be more than a prop for age,' said Hama. He looked hard at the ash-staff on which Gandalf leaned. 'Yet in doubt a man of worth will trust to his own wisdom. I believe you are friends and folk worthy of honour, who have no evil purpose. You may go in.'\n\nThe guards now lifted the heavy bars of the doors and swung them slowly inwards grumbling on their great hinges. The travellers entered. Inside it seemed dark and warm after the clear air upon the hill. The hall was long and wide and filled with shadows and half lights; mighty pillars upheld its lofty roof. But here and there bright sunbeams fell in glimmering shafts from the eastern windows, high under the deep eaves. Through the louver in the roof, above the thin wisps of issuing smoke, the sky showed pale and blue. As their eyes changed, the travellers perceived that the floor was paved with stones of many hues; branching runes and strange devices intertwined beneath their feet. They saw now that the pillars were richly carved, gleaming dully with gold and half-seen colours. Many woven cloths were hung upon the walls, and over their wide spaces marched figures of ancient legend, some dim with years, some darkling in the shade. But upon one form the sunlight fell: a young man upon a white horse. He was blowing a great horn, and his yellow hair was flying in the wind. The horse's head was lifted, and its nostrils were wide and red as it neighed, smelling battle afar. Foaming water, green and white, rushed and curled about its knees.\n\n'Behold Eorl the Young!' said Aragorn. 'Thus he rode out of the North to the Battle of the Field of Celebrant.'\n\nNow the four companions went forward, past the clear wood-fire burning upon the long hearth in the midst of the hall. Then they halted. At the far end of the house, beyond the hearth and facing north towards the doors, was a dais with three steps; and in the middle of the dais was a great gilded chair. Upon it sat a man so bent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf; but his white hair was long and thick and fell in great braids from beneath a thin golden circle set upon his brow. In the centre upon his forehead shone a single white diamond. His beard was laid like snow upon his knees; but his eyes still burned with a bright light, glinting as he gazed at the strangers. Behind his chair stood a woman clad in white. At his feet upon the steps sat a wizened figure of a man, with a pale wise face and heavy-lidded eyes.\n\nThere was a silence. The old man did not move in his chair. At length Gandalf spoke. 'Hail, Theoden son of Thengel! I have returned. For behold! the storm comes, and now all friends should gather together, lest each singly be destroyed.'\n\nSlowly the old man rose to his feet, leaning heavily upon a short black staff with a handle of white bone; and now the strangers saw that, bent though he was, he was still tall and must in youth have been high and proud indeed.\n\n'I greet you,' he said, 'and maybe you look for welcome. But truth to tell your welcome is doubtful here, Master Gandalf. You have ever been a herald of woe. Troubles follow you like crows, and ever the oftener the worse. I will not deceive you: when I heard that Shadowfax had come back riderless, I rejoiced at the return of the horse, but still more at the lack of the rider; and when Eomer brought the tidings that you had gone at last to your long home, I did not mourn. But news from afar is seldom sooth. Here you come again! And with you come evils worse than before, as might be expected. Why should I welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow? Tell me that.' Slowly he sat down again in his chair.\n\n'You speak justly, lord,' said the pale man sitting upon the steps of the dais. 'It is not yet five days since the bitter tidings came that Theodred your son was slain upon the West Marches: your right hand, Second Marshal Of the Mark. In Eomer there is little trust. Few men would be left to guard your walls, if he had been allowed to rule. And even now we learn from Gondor that the Dark Lord is stirring in the East. Such is the hour in which this wanderer chooses to return. Why indeed should we welcome you, Master Stormcrow? Lathspell I name you, Ill-news; and ill news is an ill guest they say.' He laughed grimly, as he lifted his heavy lids for a moment and gazed on the strangers with dark eyes.\n\n'You are held wise, my friend Wormtongue, and are doubtless a great support to your master,' answered Gandalf in a soft voice. 'Yet in two ways may a man come with evil tidings. He may be a worker of evil; or he may be such as leaves well alone, and comes only to bring aid in time of need.'\n\n'That is so,' said Wormtongue; 'but there is a third kind: pickers of bones, meddlers in other men's sorrows, carrion-fowl that grow fat on war. What aid have you ever brought, Stormcrow? And what aid do you bring now? It was aid from us that you sought last time that you were here. Then my lord bade you choose any horse that you would and be gone; and to the wonder of all you took Shadowfax in your insolence. My lord was sorely grieved; yet to some it seemed that to speed you from the land the price was not too great. I guess that it is likely to turn out the same once more: you will seek aid rather than render it. Do you bring men? Do you bring horses, swords, spears? That I would call aid; that is our present need. But who are these that follow at your tail? Three ragged wanderers in grey, and you yourself the most beggar-like of the four!'\n\n'The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Theoden son of Thengel,' said Gandalf. 'Has not the messenger from your gate reported the names of my companions? Seldom has any lord of Rohan received three such guests. Weapons they have laid at your doors that are worth many a mortal man, even the mightiest. Grey is their raiment, for the Elves clad them, and thus they have passed through the shadow of great perils to your hall.'\n\n'Then it is true, as Eomer reported, that you are in league with the Sorceress of the Golden Wood?' said Wormtongue. 'It is not to be wondered at: webs of deceit were ever woven in Dwimordene.'\n\nGimli strode a pace forward, but felt suddenly the hand of Gandalf clutch him by the shoulder, and he halted, standing stiff as stone.\n\n\t\tIn Dwimordene, in Lorien\n\t\tSeldom have walked the feet of Men,\n\t\tFew mortal eyes have seen the light\n\t\tThat lies there ever, long and bright.\n\t\tGaladriel! Galadriel!\n\t\tClear is the water of your well;\n\t\tWhite is the star in your white hand;\n\t\tUnmarred, unstained is leaf and land\n\t\tIn Dwimordene, in Lorien\n\t\tMore fair than thoughts of Mortal Men.\n\nThus Gandalf softly sang, and then suddenly he changed. Casting his tattered cloak aside, he stood up and leaned no longer on his staff; and he spoke in a clear cold voice. 'The wise speak only of what they know, Grima son of Galmod. A witless worm have you become. Therefore be silent, and keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a serving-man till the lightning falls.' He raised his staff. There was a roll of thunder. The sunlight was blotted out from the eastern windows; the whole hall became suddenly dark as night. The fire faded to sullen embers. Only Gandalf could be seen, standing white and tall before the blackened hearth.\n\nIn the gloom they heard the hiss of Wormtongue's voice: 'Did I not counsel you, lord, to forbid his staff? That fool, Hama, has betrayed us!' There was a flash as if lightning had cloven the roof. Then all was silent. Wormtongue sprawled on his face.\n\n'Now Theoden son of Thengel, will you hearken to me?' said Gandalf. 'Do you ask for help?' He lifted his staff and pointed to a high window. There the darkness seemed to clear, and through the opening could be seen, high and far, a patch of shining sky. 'Not all is dark. Take courage, Lord of the Mark; for better help you will not find. No counsel have I to give to those that despair. Yet counsel I could give, and words I could speak to you. Will you hear them? They are not for all ears. I bid you come out before your doors and look abroad. Too long have you sat in shadows and trusted to twisted tales and crooked promptings.'\n\nSlowly Theoden left his chair. A faint light grew in the hall again. The woman hastened to the king's side, taking his arm, and with faltering steps the old man came down from the dais and paced softly through the hall. Wormtongue remained lying on the floor. They came to the doors and Gandalf knocked.\n\n'Open!' he cried. 'The Lord of the Mark comes forth!'\n\nThe doors rolled back and a keen air came whistling in. A wind was blowing on the hill. 'Send your guards down to the stairs foot,' said Gandalf. 'And you, lady, leave him a while with me. I will care for him.'\n\n'Go, Eowyn sister-daughter!' said the old king. 'The time for fear is past.'\n\nThe woman turned and went slowly into the house. As she passed the doors she turned and looked back. Grave and thoughtful was her glance, as she looked on the king with cool pity in her eyes. Very fair was her face, and her long hair was like a river of gold. Slender and tall she was in her white robe girt with silver; but strong she seemed and stern as steel, a daughter of kings. Thus Aragorn for the first time in the full light of day beheld Eowyn, Lady of Rohan, and thought her fair, fair and cold, like a morning of pale spring that is not yet come to womanhood. And she now was suddenly aware of him: tall heir of kings, wise with many winters, greycloaked. Hiding a power that yet she felt. For a moment still as stone she stood, then turning swiftly she was gone.\n\n'Now, lord,' said Gandalf, 'look out upon your land! Breathe the free air again!'\n\nFrom the porch upon the top of the high terrace they could see beyond the stream the green fields of Rohan fading into distant grey. Curtains of wind-blown rain were slanting down. The sky above and to the west was still dark with thunder, and lightning far away flickered among the tops of hidden hills. But the wind had shifted to the north, and already the storm that had come out of the East was receding, rolling away southward to the sea. Suddenly through a rent in the clouds behind them a shaft of sun stabbed down. The falling showers gleamed like silver, and far away the river glittered like a shimmering glass.\n\n'It is not so dark here,' said Theoden.\n\n'No,' said Gandalf. 'Nor does age lie so heavily on your shoulders as some would have you think. Cast aside your prop!'\n\nFrom the king's hand the black staff fell clattering on the stones. He drew himself up, slowly, as a man that is stiff from long bending over some dull toil. Now tall and straight he stood, and his eyes were blue as he looked into the opening sky.\n\n'Dark have been my dreams of late,' he said, 'but I feel as one new-awakened. I would now that you had come before, Gandalf. For I fear that already you have come too late, only to see the last days of my house. Not long now shall stand the high hall which Brego son of Eorl built. Fire shall devour the high seat. What is to be done?'\n\n'Much,' said Gandalf. 'But first send for Eomer. Do I not guess rightly that you hold him prisoner, by the counsel of Grima, of him that all save you name the Wormtongue?'\n\n'It is true,' said Theoden. 'He had rebelled against my commands, and threatened death to Grima in my hall.'\n\n'A man may love you and yet not love Wormtongue or his counsels,' said Gandalf.\n\n'That may be. I will do as you ask. Call Hama to me. Since he proved untrusty as a doorward, let him become an errand-runner. The guilty shall bring the guilty to judgement,' said Theoden, and his voice was grim, yet he looked at Gandalf and smiled and as he did so many lines of care were smoothed away and did not return.\n\nWhen Hama had been summoned and had gone, Gandalf led Theoden to a stone seat, and then sat himself before the king upon the topmost stair. Aragorn and his companions stood nearby.\n\n'There is no time to tell all that you should hear,' said Gandalf. 'Yet if my hope is not cheated, a time will come ere long when I can speak more fully. Behold! you are come into a peril greater even than the wit of Wormtongue could weave into your dreams. But see! you dream no longer. You live. Gondor and Rohan do not stand alone. The enemy is strong beyond our reckoning, yet we have a hope at which he has not guessed.'\n\nQuickly now Gandalf spoke. His voice was low and secret, and none save the king heard what he said. But ever as he spoke the light shone brighter in Theoden's eye, and at the last he rose from his seat to his full height, and Gandalf beside him, and together they looked out from the high place towards the East.\n\n'Verily,' said Gandalf, now in a loud voice, keen and clear, 'that way lies our hope, where sits our greatest fear. Doom hangs still on a thread. Yet hope there is still, if we can but stand unconquered for a little while.'\n\nThe others too now turned their eyes eastward. Over the sundering leagues of land, far away they gazed to the edge of sight, and hope and fear bore their thoughts still on, beyond dark mountains to the Land of Shadow. Where now was the Ring-bearer? How thin indeed was the thread upon which doom still hung! It seemed to Legolas, as he strained his farseeing eyes, that he caught a glint of white: far away perchance the sun twinkled on a pinnacle of the Tower of Guard. And further still, endlessly remote and yet a present threat, there was a tiny tongue of flame.\n\nSlowly Theoden sat down again, as if weariness still struggled to master him against the will of Gandalf. He turned and looked at his great house. 'Alas!' he said, 'that these evil days should be mine, and should come in my old age instead of that peace which I have earned. Alas for Boromir the brave! The young perish and the old linger, withering.' He clutched his knees with his wrinkled hands.\n\n'Your fingers would remember their old strength better, if they grasped a sword-hilt,' said Gandalf.\n\nTheoden rose and put his hand to his side; but no sword hung at his belt. 'Where has Grima stowed it?' he muttered under his breath.\n\n'Take this, dear lord!' said a clear voice. 'It was ever at your service.' Two men had come softly up the stair and stood now a few steps from the top. Eomer was there. No helm was on his head, no mail was on his breast, but in his hand he held a drawn sword; and as he knelt he offered the hilt to his master.\n\n'How comes this?' said Theoden sternly. He turned towards Eomer and the men looked in wonder at him, standing now proud and erect. Where was the old man whom they had left crouching in his chair or leaning on his stick?\n\n'It is my doing, lord,' said Hama, trembling. I understood that Eomer was to be set free. Such joy was in my heart that maybe I have erred. Yet, since he was free again, and he a Marshal of the Mark,\u2020I\u2020brought him his sword as he bade me.'\n\n'To lay at your feet, my lord,' said Eomer.\n\nFor a moment of silence Theoden stood looking down at Eomer as he knelt still before him. Neither moved.\n\n'Will you not take the sword?' said Gandalf.\n\nSlowly Theoden stretched forth his hand. As his fingers took the hilt, it seemed to the watchers that firmness and strength returned to his thin arm. Suddenly he lifted the blade and swung it shimmering and whistling in the air. Then he gave a great cry. His voice rang clear as he chanted in the tongue of Rohan a call to arms.\n\n\t\tArise now, arise, Riders of Theoden!\n\t\tDire deeds awake, dark is it eastward.\n\t\tLet horse be bridled, horn be sounded!\n\t\tForth Eorlingas!\n\nThe guards, thinking that they were summoned, sprang up the stair. They looked at their lord in amazement, and then as one man they drew their swords and laid them at his feet. 'Command us!' they said.\n\n'Westu Theoden hal!' cried Eomer. 'It is a joy to us to see you return into your own. Never again shall it be said, Gandalf, that you come only with grief!'\n\n'Take back your sword, Eomer, sister-son!' said the king. 'Go, Hama, and seek my own sword! Grima has it in his keeping. Bring him to me also. Now, Gandalf, you said that you had counsel to give, if I would hear it. What is your counsel?'\n\n'You have yourself already taken it,' answered Gandalf. 'To put your trust in Eomer, rather than in a man of crooked mind. To cast aside regret and fear. To do the deed at hand. Every man that can ride should be sent west at once, as Eomer counselled you: we must first destroy the threat of Saruman, while we have time. If we fail, we fall. If we succeed \u0426 then we will face the next task. Meanwhile your people that are left, the women and the children and the old, should stay to the refuges that you have in the mountains. Were they not prepared against just such an evil day as this? Let them take provision, but delay not, nor burden themselves with treasures, great or small. It is their lives that are at stake.'\n\n'This counsel seems good to me now,' said Theoden. 'Let all my folk get ready! But you my guests \u0426 truly you said, Gandalf, that the courtesy of my hall is lessened. You have ridden through the night, and the morning wears away. You have had neither sleep nor food. A guest-house shall be made ready: there you shall sleep, when you have eaten.'\n\n'Nay, lord,' said Aragorn. 'There is no rest yet for the weary. The men of Rohan must ride forth today, and we will ride with them, axe, sword, and bow. We did not bring them to rest against your wall, Lord of the Mark. And I promised Eomer that my sword and his should be drawn together.'\n\n'Now indeed there is hope of victory!' said Eomer.\n\n'Hope, yes,' said Gandalf. 'But Isengard is strong. And other perils draw ever nearer. Do not delay, Theoden, when we are gone. Lead your people swiftly to the Hold of Dunharrow in the hills!'\n\n'Nay, Gandalf!' said the king. 'You do not know your own skill in healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall in the front of the battle, if it must be. Thus shall I sleep better.'\n\n'Then even the defeat of Rohan will be glorious in song,' said Aragorn. The armed men that stood near clashed their weapons, crying: 'The Lord of the Mark will ride! Forth Eorlingas!'\n\n'But your people must not be both unarmed and shepherdless,' said Gandalf. 'Who shall guide them and govern them in your place?'\n\n'I will take thought for that ere I go,' answered Theoden. 'Here comes my counsellor.'\n\nAt that moment Hama came again from the hall. Behind him cringing between two other men, came Grima the Wormtongue. His face was very white. His eyes blinked in the sunlight. Hama knelt and presented to Theoden a long sword in a scabbard clasped with gold and set with green gems. 'Here, lord, is Herugrim, your ancient blade,' he said. 'It was found in his chest. Loth was he to render up the keys. Many other things are there which men have missed.'\n\n'You lie,' said Wormtongue. 'And this sword your master himself gave into my keeping.'\n\n'And he now requires it of you again,' said Theoden. 'Does that displease you?'\n\n'Assuredly not, lord,' said Wormtongue. 'I care for you and yours as best I may. But do not weary yourself, or tax too heavily your strength. Let others deal with these irksome guests. Your meat is about to be set on the board. Will you not go to it?'\n\n'I will,' said Theoden. 'And let food for my guests be set on the board beside me. The host rides today. Send the heralds forth! Let them summon all who dwell nigh! Every man and strong lad able to bear arms, all who have horses, let them be ready in the saddle at the gate ere the second hour from noon!'\n\n'Dear lord!' cried Wormtongue. 'It is as I feared. This wizard has bewitched you. Are none to be left to defend the Golden Hall of your fathers, and all your treasure? None to guard the Lord of the Mark?'\n\n'If this is bewitchment,' said Theoden, 'it seems to me more wholesome than your whisperings. Your leechcraft ere long would have had me walking on all fours like a beast. No, not one shall be left, not even Grima. Grima shall ride too. Go! You have yet time to clean the rust from your sword.'\n\n'Mercy, lord!' whined Wormtongue, grovelling on the ground. 'Have pity on one worn out in your service. Send me not from your side! I at least will stand by you when all others have gone. Do not send your faithful Grima away!'\n\n'You have my pity,' said Theoden. 'And I do not send you from my side. I go myself to war with my men. I bid you come with me and prove your faith.'\n\nWormtongue looked from face to face. In his eyes was the hunted look of a beast seeking some gap in the ring of his enemies. He licked his lips with a long pale tongue. 'Such a resolve might be expected from a lord of the House of Eorl, old though he be,' he said. 'But those who truly love him would spare his failing years. Yet I see that I come too late. Others, whom the death of my lord would perhaps grieve less, have already persuaded him. If I cannot undo their work, hear me at least in this, lord! One who knows your mind and honours your commands should be left in Edoras. Appoint a faithful steward. Let your counsellor Grima keep all things till your return \u0426 and I pray that we may see it, though no wise man will deem it hopeful.'\n\nEomer laughed. 'And if that plea does not excuse you from war, most noble Wormtongue,' he said, what office of less honour would you accept? To carry a sack of meal up into the mountains \u0426 if any man would trust you with it?'\n\n'Nay, Eomer, you do not fully understand the mind of Master Wormtongue,' said Gandalf, turning his piercing glance upon him. 'He is bold and cunning. Even now he plays a game with peril and wins a throw. Hours of my precious time he has wasted already. 'Down snake!' he said suddenly in a terrible voice. 'Down on your belly! How long is it since Saruman bought you? What was the promised price? When all the men were dead, you were to pick your share of the treasure, and take the woman you desire? Too long have you watched her under your eyelids and haunted her steps.'\n\nEomer grasped his sword. 'That I knew already,' he muttered. 'For that reason I would have slain him before, forgetting the law of the hall. But there are other reasons.' He stepped forward, but Gandalf stayed him with his hand.\n\n'Eowyn is safe now,' he said. 'But you, Wormtongue, you have done what you could for your true master. Some reward you have earned at least. Yet Saruman is apt to overlook his bargains. I should advise you to go quickly and remind him, lest he forget your faithful service.'\n\n'You lie,' said Wormtongue.\n\n'That word comes too oft and easy from your lips,' said Gandalf. 'I do not lie. See, Theoden, here is a snake! With safety you cannot take it with you, nor can you leave it behind. To slay it would be just. But it was not always as it now is. Once it was a man, and did you service in its fashion. Give him a horse and let him go at once, wherever he chooses. By his choice you shall judge him.'\n\n'Do you hear this, Wormtongue?' said Theoden. 'This is your choice: to ride with me to war, and let us see in battle whether you are true; or to go now, whither you will. But then, if ever we meet again, I shall not be merciful.'\n\nSlowly Wormtongue rose. He looked at them with half-closed eyes. Last of all he scanned Theoden's face and opened his mouth as if to speak. Then suddenly he drew himself up. His hands worked. His eyes glittered. Such malice was in them that men stepped back from him. He bared his teeth; and then with a hissing breath he spat before the king's feet, and darting to one side, he fled down the stair.\n\n'After him!' said Theoden. 'See that he does no harm to any, but do not hurt him or hinder him. Give him a horse, if he wishes it.'\n\n'And if any will bear him,' said Eomer.\n\nOne of the guards ran down the stair. Another went to the well at the foot of the terrace and in his helm drew water. With it he washed clean the stones that Wormtongue had defiled.\n\n'Now my guests, come!' said Theoden. 'Come and take such refreshment as haste allows.'\n\nThey passed back into the great house. Already they heard below them in the town the heralds crying and the war-horns blowing. For the king was to ride forth as soon as the men of the town and those dwelling near could be armed and assembled.\n\nAt the king's board sat Eomer and the four guests, and there also waiting upon the king was the lady Eowyn. They ate and drank swiftly. The others were silent while Theoden questioned Gandalf concerning Saruman.\n\n'How far back his treachery goes, who can guess?' said Gandalf. 'He was not always evil. Once I do not doubt that he was the friend of Rohan; and even when his heart grew colder, he found you useful still. But for long now he has plotted your ruin, wearing the mask of Friendship, until he was ready. In those years Wormtongue's task was easy, and all that you did was swiftly known in Isengard; for your land was open, and strangers came and went. And ever Wormtongue's whispering was in your ears, poisoning your thought, chilling your heart, weakening your limbs, while others watched and could do nothing, for your will was in his keeping.\n\n'But when I escaped and warned you, then the mask was torn, for those who would see. After that Wormtongue played dangerously, always seeking to delay you, to prevent your full strength being gathered. He was crafty: dulling men's wariness, or working on their fears, as served the occasion. Do you not remember how eagerly he urged that no man should be spared on a wildgoose chase northward, when the immediate peril was westward? He persuaded you to forbid Eomer to pursue the raiding Orcs. If Eomer had not defied Wormtongue's voice speaking with your mouth, those Orcs would have reached Isengard by now, bearing a great prize. Not indeed that prize which Saruman desires above all else, but at the least two members of my Company, sharers of a secret hope, of which even to you, lord, I cannot yet speak openly. Dare you think of what they might now be suffering, or what Saruman might now have learned to our destruction?'\n\n'I owe much to Eomer,' said Theoden. 'Faithful heart may have forward tongue.'\n\n'Say also,' said Gandalf, 'that to crooked eyes truth may wear a wry face.'\n\n'Indeed my eyes were almost blind,' said Theoden. 'Most of all I owe to you, my guest. Once again you have come in time. I would give you a gift ere we go, at your own choosing. You have only to name aught that is mine. I reserve now only my sword!'\n\n'Whether I came in time or not is yet to be seen,' said Gandalf. 'But as for your gift, lord, I will choose one that will fit my need: swift and sure. Give me Shadowfax! He was only lent before, if loan we may call it. But now shall ride him into great hazard, setting silver against black: I would not risk anything that is not my own. And already there is a bond of love between us.'\n\n'You choose well,' said Theoden; 'and I give him now gladly. Yet it is a great gift. There is none like to Shadowfax. In him one of the mighty steeds of old has returned. None such shall return again. And to you my other guests I will offer such things as may be found in my armoury. Swords you do not need, but there are helms and coats of mail of cunning work, gifts to my fathers out of Gondor. Choose from these ere we go, and may they serve you well!'\n\nNow men came bearing raiment of war from the king's hoard and they arrayed Aragorn and Legolas in shining mail. Helms too they chose, and round shields: their bosses were overlaid with gold and set with gems, green and red and white. Gandalf took no armour; and Gimli needed no coat of rings, even if one had been found to match his stature, for there was no hauberk in the hoards of Edoras of better make than his short corslet forged beneath the Mountain in the North. But he chose a cap of iron and leather that fitted well upon his round head; and a small shield he also took. It bore the running horse, white upon green, that was the emblem of the House of Eorl.\n\n'May it keep you well!' said Theoden. 'It was made for me in Thengel's day, while still I was a boy.'\n\nGimli bowed. 'I am proud, Lord of the Mark, to bear your device,' he said. 'Indeed sooner would I bear a horse than be borne by one. I love my feet better. But, maybe, I shall come yet where I can stand and fight.'\n\n'It may well be so,' said Theoden.\n\nThe king now rose, and at once Eowyn came forward bearing wine. 'Ferthu Theoden hal!' she said. 'Receive now this cup and drink in happy hour. Health be with thee at thy going and coming!'\n\nTheoden drank from the cup, and she then proffered it to the guests. As she stood before Aragorn she paused suddenly and looked upon him, and her eyes were shining. And he looked down upon her fair face and smiled; but as he took the cup, his hand met hers, and he knew that she trembled at the touch. 'Hail Aragorn son of Arathorn!' she said. 'Hail Lady of Rohan!' he answered, but his face now was troubled and he did not smile.\n\nWhen they had all drunk, the king went down the hall to the doors. There the guards awaited him, and heralds stood, and all the lords and chiefs were gathered together that remained in Edoras or dwelt nearby.\n\n'Behold! I go forth, and it seems like to be my last riding,' said Theoden. 'I have no child. Theodred my son is slain. I name Eomer my sister-son to be my heir. If neither of us return, then choose a new lord as you will. But to someone I must now entrust my people that I leave behind, to rule them in my place. Which of you will stay?'\n\nNo man spoke.\n\n'Is there none whom you would name? In whom do my people trust?'\n\n'In the House of Eorl,' answered Hama.\n\n'But Eomer I cannot spare, nor would he stay,' said the king, 'and he is the last of that House.'\n\n'I said not Eomer,' answered Hama. 'And he is not the last. There is Eowyn, daughter of Eomund, his sister. She is fearless and high-hearted. All love her. Let her be as lord to the Eorlingas, while we are gone.'\n\n'It shall be so,' said Theoden. 'Let the heralds announce to the folk that the Lady Eowyn will lead them!'\n\nThen the king sat upon a seat before his doors, and Eowyn knelt before him and received from him a sword and a fair corslet. 'Farewell sister-daughter!' he said. 'Dark is the hour, yet maybe we shall return to the Golden Hall. But in Dunharrow the people may long defend themselves, and if the battle go ill, thither will come all who escape.'\n\n'Speak not so!' she answered. 'A year shall I endure for every day that passes until your return.' But as she spoke her eyes went to Aragorn who stood nearby.\n\n'The king shall come again,' he said. 'Fear not! Not West but East does our doom await us.'\n\nThe king now went down the stair with Gandalf beside him. The others followed. Aragorn looked back as they passed towards the gate. Alone Eowyn stood before the doors of the house at the stair's head; the sword was set upright before her, and her hands were laid upon the hilt. She was clad now in mail and shone like silver in the sun.\n\nGimli walked with Legolas, his axe on his shoulder. 'Well, at last we set off!' he said. 'Men need many words before deeds. My axe is restless in my hands. Though I doubt not that these Rohirrim are fell-handed when they come to it. Nonetheless this is not the warfare that suits me. How shall I come to the battle? I wish I could walk and not bump like a sack at Gandalf's saddlebow.'\n\n'A safer seat than many, I guess,' said Legolas. 'Yet doubtless Gandalf will gladly put you down on your feet when blows begin; or Shadowfax himself. An axe is no weapon for a rider.'\n\n'And a Dwarf is no horseman. It is orc-necks I would hew, not shave the scalps of Men,' said Gimli, patting the haft of his axe.\n\nAt the gate they found a great host of men, old and young, all ready in the saddle. More than a thousand were there mustered. Their spears were like a springing wood. Loudly and joyously they shouted as Theoden came forth. Some held in readiness the king's horse, Snowmane, and others held the horses of Aragorn and Legolas. Gimli stood ill at ease, frowning, but Eomer came up to him, leading his horse.\n\n'Hail, Gimli Gloin's son!' he cried. 'I have not had time to learn gentle speech under your rod, as you promised. But shall we not put aside our quarrel? At least I will speak no evil again of the Lady of the Wood.'\n\n'I will forget my wrath for a while, Eomer son of Eomund,' said Gimli, 'but if ever you chance to see the Lady Galadriel with your eyes, then you shall acknowledge her the fairest of ladies, or our friendship will end.'\n\n'So be it!' said Eomer. 'But until that time pardon me, and in token of pardon ride with me, I beg. Gandalf will be at the head with the Lord of the Mark; but Firefoot, my horse, will bear us both, if you will.'\n\n'I thank you indeed,' said Gimli greatly pleased. 'I will gladly go with you, if Legolas, my comrade, may ride beside us.'\n\n'It shall be so,' said Eomer. 'Legolas upon my left, and Aragorn upon my right, and none will dare to stand before us!'\n\n'Where is Shadowfax?' said Gandalf.\n\n'Running wild over the grass,' they answered. 'He will let no man handle him. There he goes, away down by the ford, like a shadow among the willows.'\n\nGandalf whistled and called aloud the horse's name, and far away he tossed his head and neighed, and turning sped towards the host like an arrow.\n\n'Were the breath of the West Wind to take a body visible, even so would it appear,' said Eomer, as the great horse ran up, until he stood before the wizard.\n\n'The gift seems already to be given,' said Theoden. 'But hearken all! Here now I name my guest, Gandalf Greyhame, wisest of counsellors; most welcome of wanderers, a lord of the Mark, a chieftain of the Eorlingas while our kin shall last; and I give to him Shadowfax, prince of horses.'\n\n'I thank you, Theoden King,' said Gandalf. Then suddenly he threw back his grey cloak, and cast aside his hat, and leaped to horseback. He wore no helm nor mail. His snowy hair flew free in the wind, his white robes shone dazzling in the sun.\n\n'Behold the White Rider!' cried Aragorn, and all took up the words.\n\n'Our King and the White Rider!' they shouted. 'Forth Eorlingas!'\n\nThe trumpets sounded. The horses reared and neighed. Spear clashed on shield. Then the king raised his hand, and with a rush like the sudden onset of a great wind the last host of Rohan rode thundering into the West. Far over the plain Eowyn saw the glitter of their spears, as she stood still, alone before the doors of the silent house.\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nHelm's Deep\n\nThe sun was already westering as they rode from Edoras, and the light of it was in their eyes, turning all the rolling fields of Rohan to a golden haze. There was a beaten way, north-westward along the foot-hills of the White Mountains, and this they followed, up and down in a green country, crossing small swift streams by many fords. Far ahead and to their right the Misty Mountains loomed; ever darker and taller they grew as the miles went by. The sun went slowly down before them. Evening came behind.\n\nThe host rode on. Need drove them. Fearing to come too late, they rode with all the speed they could, pausing seldom. Swift and enduring were the steeds of Rohan, but there were many leagues to go. Forty leagues and more it was, as a bird flies, from Edoras to the fords of the Isen, where they hoped to find the king's men that held back the hosts of Saruman.\n\nNight closed about them. At last they halted to make their camp. They had ridden for some five hours and were far out upon the western plain, yet more than half their journey lay still before them. In a great circle, under the starry sky and the waxing moon, they now made their bivouac. They lit no fires, for they were uncertain of events; but they set a ring of mounted guards about them, and scouts rode out far ahead, passing like shadows in the folds of the land. The slow night passed without tidings or alarm. At dawn the horns sounded, and within an hour they took the road again.\n\nThere were no clouds overhead yet, but a heaviness was in the air; it was hot for the season of the year. The rising sun was hazy, and behind it, following it slowly up the sky, there was a growing darkness, as of a great storm moving out of the East. And away in the North-west there seemed to be another darkness brooding about the feet of the Misty Mountains, a shadow that crept down slowly from the Wizard's Vale.\n\nGandalf dropped back to where Legolas rode beside Eomer. 'You have the keen eyes of your fair kindred, Legolas,' he said, 'and they can tell a sparrow from a finch a league off. Tell me, can you see anything away yonder towards Isengard?'\n\n'Many miles lie between,' said Legolas, gazing thither and shading his eyes with his long hand. 'I can see a darkness. There are shapes moving in it, great shapes far away upon the bank of the river; but what they are I cannot tell. It is not mist or cloud that defeats my eyes: there is a veiling shadow that some power lays upon the land, and it marches slowly down stream. It is as if the twilight under endless trees were flowing downwards from the hills.'\n\n'And behind us comes a very storm of Mordor,' said Gandalf. 'It will be a black night.'\n\nAs the second day of their riding drew on, the heaviness in the air increased. In the afternoon the dark clouds began to overtake them: a sombre canopy with great billowing edges flecked with dazzling light. The sun went down, blood-red in a smoking haze. The spears of the Riders were tipped with fire as the last shafts of light kindled the steep faces of the peaks of Thrihyrne: now very near they stood on the northernmost arm of the White Mountains, three jagged horns staring at the sunset. In the last red glow men in the vanguard saw a black speck, a horseman riding back towards them. They halted awaiting him.\n\nHe came, a weary man with dinted helm and cloven shield. Slowly he climbed from his horse and stood there a while gasping. At length he spoke. 'Is Eomer here?' he asked. 'You come at last, but too late, and with too little strength. Things have gone evilly since Theodred fell. We were driven back yesterday over the Isen with great loss; many perished at the crossing. Then at night fresh forces came over the river against our camp. All Isengard must be emptied; and Saruman has armed the wild hillmen and herd-folk of Dunland beyond the rivers, and these also he loosed upon us. We were overmastered. The shield-wall was broken. Erkenbrand of Westfold has drawn off those men he could gather towards his fastness in Helm's Deep. The rest are scattered.\n\n'Where is Eomer? Tell him there is no hope ahead. He should return to Edoras before the wolves of Isengard come there.' Theoden had sat silent, hidden from the man's sight behind his guards; now he urged his horse forward. 'Come, stand before me, Ceorl!' he said. 'I am here. The last host of the Eorlingas has ridden forth. It will not return without battle.'\n\nThe man's face lightened with joy and wonder. He drew himself up. Then he knelt, offering his notched sword to the king. 'Command me, lord!' he cried. 'And pardon me! I thought\u0426'\n\n'You thought I remained in Meduseld bent like an old tree under winter snow. So it was when you rode to war. But a west wind has shaken the boughs,' said Theoden. 'Give this man a fresh horse! Let us ride to the help of Erkenbrand!'\n\nWhile Theoden was speaking, Gandalf rode a short way ahead, and he sat there alone, gazing north to Isengard and west to the setting sun. Now he came back.\n\n'Ride, Theoden!' he said. 'Ride to Helm's Deep! Go not to the Fords of Isen, and do not tarry in the plain! I must leave you for a while. Shadowfax must bear me now on a swift errand.' Turning to Aragorn and Eomer and the men of the king's household, he cried: 'Keep well the Lord of the Mark, till I return. Await me at Helm's Gate! Farewell!'\n\nHe spoke a word to Shadowfax, and like an arrow from the bow the great horse sprang away. Even as they looked he was gone: a flash of silver in the sunset, a wind over the grass, a shadow that fled and passed from sight. Snowmane snorted and reared, eager to follow; but only a swift bird on the wing could have overtaken him.\n\n'What does that mean?' said one of the guard to Hama.\n\n'That Gandalf Greyhame has need of haste,' answered Hama. 'Ever he goes and comes unlooked-for.'\n\n'Wormtongue, were he here, would not find it hard to explain,' said the other.\n\n'True enough,' said Hama, 'but for myself, I will wait until I see Gandalf again.'\n\n'Maybe you will wait long,' said the other.\n\nThe host turned away now from the road to the Fords of Isen and bent their course southward. Night fell, and still they rode on. The hills drew near, but the tall peaks of Thrihyrne were already dim against the darkening sky. Still some miles away, on the far side of the Westfold Vale, lay a green coomb, a great bay in the mountains, out of which a gorge opened in the hills. Men of that land called it Helm's Deep, after a hero of old wars who had made his refuge there. Ever steeper and narrower it wound inward from the north under the shadow of the Thrihyrne, till the crow-haunted cliffs rose like mighty towers on either side, shutting out the light.\n\nAt Helm's Gate, before the mouth of the Deep, there was a heel of rock thrust outward by the northern cliff. There upon its spur stood high walls of ancient stone, and within them was a lofty tower. Men said that in the far-off days of the glory of Gondor the sea-kings had built here this fastness with the hands of giants. The Hornburg it was called, for a trumpet sounded upon the tower echoed in the Deep behind, as if armies long-forgotten were issuing to war from caves beneath the hills. A wall, too, the men of old had made from the Hornburg to the southern cliff, barring the entrance to the gorge. Beneath it by a wide culvert the Deeping-stream passed out. About the feet of the Hornrock it wound, and flowed then in a gully through the midst of a wide green gore, sloping gently down from Helm's Gate to Helm's Dike. Thence it fell into the Deeping-coomb and out into the Westfold Vale. There in the Hornburg at Helm's Gate Erkenbrand, master of Westfold on the borders of the Mark, now dwelt. As the days darkened with threat of war, being wise, he had repaired the wall and made the fastness strong.\n\nThe Riders were still in the low valley before the mouth of the Coomb, when cries and hornblasts were heard from their scouts that went in front. Out of the darkness arrows whistled. Swiftly a scout rode back and reported that wolf-riders were abroad in the valley, and that a host of Orcs and wild men were hurrying southward from the Fords of Isen and seemed to be making for Helm's Deep.\n\n'We have found many of our folk lying slain as they fled thither,' said the scout. 'And we have met scattered companies, going this way and that, leaderless. What has become of Erkenbrand none seem to know. It is likely that he will be overtaken ere he can reach Helm's Gate, if he has not already perished.'\n\n'Has aught been seen of Gandalf?' asked Theoden.\n\n'Yes, lord. Many have seen an old man in white upon a horse, passing hither and thither over the plains like wind in the grass. Some thought he was Saruman. It is said that he went away ere nightfall towards Isengard. Some say also that Wormtongue was seen earlier, going northward with a company of Orcs.'\n\n'It will go ill with Wormtongue, if Gandalf comes upon him said Theoden. 'Nonetheless I miss now both my counsellors, the old and the new. But in this need we have no better choice than to go on, as Gandalf said, to Helm's Gate, whether Erkenbrand be there or no. Is it known how great is the host that comes from the North?'\n\n'It is very great,' said the scout. 'He that flies counts every foeman twice, yet I have spoken to stouthearted men, and I do not doubt that the main strength of the enemy is many times as great as all that we have here.'\n\n'Then let us be swift,' said Eomer. 'Let us drive through such foes as are already between us and the fastness. There are caves in Helm's Deep where hundreds may lie hid; and secret ways lead thence up on to the hills.\n\n'Trust not to secret ways,' said the king. 'Saruman has long spied out this land. Still in that place our defence may last long. Let us go!'\n\nAragorn and Legolas went now with Eomer in the van. On through the dark night they rode, ever slower as the darkness deepened and their way climbed southward, higher and higher into the dim folds about the mountains' feet. They found few of the enemy before them. Here and there they came upon roving bands of Orcs; but they fled ere the Riders could take or slay them.\n\n'It will not be long I fear,' said Eomer, 'ere the coming of the king's host will be known to the leader of our enemies, Saruman or whatever captain he has sent forth.'\n\nThe rumour of war grew behind them. Now they could hear, borne over the dark, the sound of harsh singing. They had climbed far up into the Deeping-coomb when they looked back. Then they saw torches:\u2020countless points of fiery light upon the black fields behind, scattered like red flowers, or winding up from the lowlands in long flickering lines. Here and there a larger blaze leapt up.\n\n'It is a great host and follows us hard,' said Aragorn.\n\n'They bring fire,' said Theoden, 'and they are burning as they come, rick, cot, and tree. This was a rich vale and had many homesteads. Alas for my folk!'\n\n'Would that day was here and we might ride down upon them like a storm out of the mountains!' said Aragorn. 'It grieves me to fly before them.'\n\n'We need not fly much further,' said Eomer. 'Not far ahead now lies Helm's Dike, an ancient trench and rampart scored across the coomb, two furlongs below Helm's Gate. There we can turn and give battle.'\n\n'Nay, we are too few to defend the Dike,' said Theoden. 'It is a mile long or more, and the breach in it is wide.'\n\n'At the breach our rearguard must stand, if we are pressed,' said Eomer.\n\nThere was neither star nor moon when the Riders came to the breach in the Dike, where the stream from above passed out, and the road beside it ran down from the Hornburg. The rampart loomed suddenly before them, a high shadow beyond a dark pit. As they rode up a sentinel challenged them.\n\n'The Lord of the Mark rides to Helm's Gate,' Eomer answered. 'I, Eomer son of Eomund, speak.'\n\n'This is good tidings beyond hope,' said the sentinel. 'Hasten! The enemy is on your heels.'\n\nThe host passed through the breach and halted on the sloping sward above. They now learned to their joy that Erkenbrand had left many men to hold Helm's Gate, and more had since escaped thither.\n\n'Maybe, we have a thousand fit to fight on foot,' said Gamling, an old man, the leader of those that watched the Dike. 'But most of them have seen too many winters, as I have, or too few, as my son's son here. What news of Erkenbrand? Word came yesterday that he was retreating hither with all that is left of the best Riders of Westfold. But he has not come.'\n\n'I fear that he will not come now,' said Eomer. 'Our scouts have gained no news of him, and the enemy fills all the valley behind us.'\n\n'I would that he had escaped,' said Theoden. 'He was a mighty man. In him lived again the valour of Helm the Hammerhand. But we cannot await him here. We must draw all our forces now behind the walls. Are you well stored? We bring little provision, for we rode forth to open battle, not to a siege.'\n\n'Behind us in the caves of the Deep are three parts of the folk of Westfold, old and young, children and women,' said Gamling. 'But great store of food, and many beasts and their fodder, have also been gathered there.'\n\n'That is well,' said Eomer. 'They are burning or despoiling all that is left in the vale.'\n\n'If they come to bargain for our goods at Helm's Gate, they will pay a high price,' said Gamling.\n\nThe king and his Riders passed on. Before the causeway that crossed the stream they dismounted. In a long file they led their horses up the ramp and passed within the gates of the Hornburg. There they were welcomed again with joy and renewed hope; for now there were men enough to man both the burg and the barrier wall.\n\nQuickly Eomer set his men in readiness. The king and the men of his household were in the Hornburg, and there also were many of the Westfold-men. But on the Deeping Wall and its tower, and behind it, Eomer arrayed most of the strength that he had, for here the defence seemed more doubtful, if the assault were determined and in great force. The horses were led far up the Deep under such guard as could be spared.\n\nThe Deeping Wall was twenty feet high, and so thick that four men could walk abreast along the top, sheltered by a parapet over which only a tall man could look. Here and there were clefts in the stone through which men could shoot. This battlement could be reached by a stair running down from a door in the outer court of the Hornburg; three flights of steps led also up on to the wall from the Deep behind; but in front it was smooth, and the great stones of it were set with such skill that no foothold could be found at their joints, and at the top they hung over like a sea-delved cliff.\n\nGimli stood leaning against the breastwork upon the wall. Legolas sat above on the parapet, fingering his bow, and peering out into the gloom.\n\n'This is more to my liking,' said the dwarf, stamping on the stones. 'Ever my heart rises as we draw near the mountains. There is good rock here. This country has tough bones. I felt them in my feet as we came up from the dike. Give me a year and a hundred of my kin and I would make this a place that armies would break upon like water.'\n\n'I do not doubt it,' said Legolas. 'But you are a dwarf, and dwarves are strange folk. I do not like this place, and I shall like it no more by the light of day. But you comfort me, Gimli, and I am glad to have you standing nigh with your stout legs and your hard axe. I wish there were more of your kin among us. But even more would I give for a hundred good archers of Mirkwood. We shall need them. The Rohirrim have good bowmen after their fashion, but there are too few here, too few.'\n\n'It is dark for archery,' said Gimli. 'Indeed it is time for sleep. Sleep! I feel the need of it, as never I thought any dwarf could. Riding is tiring work. Yet my axe is restless in my hand. Give me a row of orc-necks and room to swing and all weariness will fall from me!'\n\nA slow time passed. Far down in the valley scattered fires still burned. The hosts of Isengard were advancing in silence now. Their torches could be seen winding up the coomb in many lines.\n\nSuddenly from the Dike yells and screams, and the fierce battle-cries of men broke out. Flaming brands appeared over the brink and clustered thickly at the breach. Then they scattered and vanished. Men came galloping back over the field and up the ramp to the gate of the Hornburg. The rearguard of the Westfolders had been driven in.\n\n'The enemy is at hand!' they said. 'We loosed every arrow that we had, and filled the Dike with Orcs. But it will not halt them long. Already they are scaling the bank at many points, thick as marching ants. But we have taught them not to carry torches.'\n\nIt was now past midnight. The sky was utterly dark, and the stillness of the heavy air foreboded storm. Suddenly the clouds were seared by a blinding flash. Branched lightning smote down upon the eastward hills. For a staring moment the watchers on the walls saw all the space between them and the Dike lit with white light: it was boiling and crawling with black shapes, some squat and broad, some tall and grim, with high helms and sable shields. Hundreds and hundreds more were pouring over the Dike and through the breach. The dark tide flowed up to the walls from cliff to cliff. Thunder rolled in the valley. Rain came lashing down.\n\nArrows thick as the rain came whistling over the battlements, and fell clinking and glancing on the stones. Some found a mark. The assault on Helm's Deep had begun, but no sound or challenge was heard within; no answering arrows came.\n\nThe assailing hosts halted, foiled by the silent menace of rock and wall. Ever and again the lightning tore aside the darkness. Then the Orcs screamed, waving spear and sword, and shooting a cloud of arrows at any that stood revealed upon the battlements; and the men of the Mark amazed looked out, as it seemed to them, upon a great field of dark corn, tossed by a tempest of war, and every ear glinted with barbed light.\n\nBrazen trumpets sounded. The enemy surged forward, some against the Deeping Wall, other towards the causeway and the ramp that led up to the Hornburg-gates. There the hugest Orcs were mustered, and the wild men of the Dunland fells. A moment they hesitated and then on they came. The lightning flashed, and blazoned upon every helm and shield the ghastly hand of Isengard was seen. They reached the summit of the rock; they drove towards the gates.\n\nThen at last an answer came: a storm of arrows met them, and a hail of stones. They wavered, broke, and fled back; and then charged again, broke and charged again; and each time, like the incoming sea, they halted at a higher point. Again trumpets rang, and a press of roaring men leaped forth. They held their great shields above them like a roof, while in their midst they bore two trunks of mighty trees. Behind them orc-archers crowded, sending a hail of darts against the bowmen on the walls. They gained the gates. The trees, swung by strong arms, smote the timbers with a rending boom. If any man fell, crushed by a stone hurtling from above, two others sprang to take his place. Again and again the great rams swung and crashed.\n\nEomer and Aragorn stood together on the Deeping Wall. They heard the roar of voices and the thudding of the rams; and then in a sudden flash of light they beheld the peril of the gates.\n\n'Come!' said Aragorn. 'This is the hour when we draw swords together!'\n\nRunning like fire, they sped along the wall, and up the steps, and passed into the outer court upon the Rock. As they ran they gathered a handful of stout swordsmen. There was a small postern-door that opened in an angle of the burg-wall on the west, where the cliff stretched out to meet it. On that side a narrow path ran round towards the great gate, between the wall and the sheer brink of the Rock. Together Eomer and Aragorn sprang through the door, their men close behind. The swords flashed from the sheath as one.\n\n'Guthwine!' cried Eomer. 'Guthwine for the Mark!'\n\n'Anduril!' cried Aragorn. 'Anduril for the Dunedain!'\n\nCharging from the side, they hurled themselves upon the wild men. Anduril rose and fell, gleaming with white fire. A shout went up from wall and tower: 'Anduril! Anduril goes to war. The Blade that was Broken shines again!'\n\nDismayed the rammers let fall the trees and turned to fight; but the wall of their shields was broken as by a lightning-stroke, and they were swept away, hewn down, or cast over the Rock into the stony stream below. The orc-archers shot wildly and then fled.\n\nFor a moment Eomer and Aragorn halted before the gates. The thunder was rumbling in the distance now. The lightning flickered still, far off among the mountains in the South. A keen wind was blowing from the North again. The clouds were torn and drifting, and stars peeped out; and above the hills of the Coomb-side the westering moon rode, glimmering yellow in the storm-wrack.\n\n'We did not come too soon,' said Aragorn, looking at the gates. Their great hinges and iron bars were wrenched and bent; many of their timbers were cracked.\n\n'Yet we cannot stay here beyond the walls to defend them,' said Eomer. 'Look!' He pointed to the causeway. Already a great press of Orcs and Men were gathering again beyond the stream. Arrows whined, and skipped on the stones about them. 'Come! We must get back and see what we can do to pile stone and beam across the gates within. Come now!'\n\nThey turned and ran. At that moment some dozen Orcs that had lain motionless among the slain leaped to their feet, and came silently and swiftly behind. Two flung themselves to the ground at Eomer's heels, tripped him, and in a moment they were on top of him. But a small dark figure that none had observed sprang out of the shadows and gave a hoarse shout: Baruk Khazad! Khazad ai-menu! An axe swung and swept back. Two Orcs fell headless. The rest fled.\n\nEomer struggled to his feet, even as Aragorn ran back to his aid.\n\nThe postern was closed again, the iron door was barred and piled inside with stones. When all were safe within, Eomer turned: 'I thank you, Gimli son of Gloin!' he said. 'I did not know that you were with us in the sortie. But oft the unbidden guest proves the best company. How came you there?'\n\n'I followed you to shake off sleep,' said Gimli, 'but I looked on the hillmen and they seemed over large for me, so I sat beside a stone to see your sword-play.'\n\n'I shall not find it easy to repay you,' said Eomer.\n\n'There may be many a chance ere the night is over,' laughed the Dwarf. 'But I am content. Till now I have hewn naught but wood since I left Moria.'\n\n'Two!' said Gimli, patting his axe. He had returned to his place on the wall.\n\n'Two?' said Legolas. 'I have done better, though now I must grope for spent arrows; all mine are gone. Yet I make my tale twenty at the least. But that is only a few leaves in a forest.'\n\nThe sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was shining brightly. But the light brought little hope to the Riders of the Mark. The enemy before them seemed to have grown rather than diminished, still more were pressing up from the valley through the breach. The sortie upon the Rock gained only a brief respite. The assault on the gates was redoubled. Against the Deeping Wall the hosts of Isengard roared like a sea. Orcs and hillmen swarmed about its feet from end to end. Ropes with grappling hooks were hurled over the parapet faster than men could cut them or fling them back. Hundreds of long ladders were lifted up. Many were cast down in ruin, but many more replaced them, and Orcs sprang up them like apes in the dark forests of the South. Before the wall's foot the dead and broken were piled like shingle in a storm; ever higher rose the hideous mounds, and still the enemy came on.\n\nThe men of Rohan grew weary. All their arrows were spent, and every shaft was shot; their swords were notched, and their shields were riven. Three times Aragorn and Eomer rallied them, and three times Anduril flamed in a desperate charge that drove the enemy from the wall.\n\nThen a clamour arose in the Deep behind. Orcs had crept like rats through the culvert through which the stream flowed out. There they had gathered in the shadow of the cliffs, until the assault above was hottest and nearly all the men of the defence had rushed to the wall's top. Then they sprang out. Already some had passed into the jaws of the Deep and were among the horses, fighting with the guards.\n\nDown from the wall leapt Gimli with a fierce cry that echoed in the cliffs. 'Khazad! Khazad!' He soon had work enough.\n\n'Ai-oi!' he shouted. 'The Orcs are behind the wall. Ai-oi! Come, Legolas! There are enough for us both. Khazad ai-menu!'\n\nGamling the Old looked down from the Hornburg, hearing the great voice of the dwarf above all the tumult. 'The Orcs are in the Deep!' he cried. 'Helm! Helm! Forth Helmingas!' he shouted as he leaped down the stair from the Rock with many men of Westfold at his back.\n\nTheir onset was fierce and sudden, and the Orcs gave way before them. Ere long they were hemmed in in the narrows of the gorge, and all were slain or driven shrieking into the chasm of the Deep to fall before the guardians of the hidden caves.\n\n'Twenty-one!' cried Gimli. He hewed a two-handed stroke and laid the last Orc before his feet. 'Now my count passes Master Legolas again.'\n\n'We must stop this rat-hole,' said Gamling. 'Dwarves are said to be cunning folk with stone. Lend us your aid, master!'\n\n'We do not shape stone with battle-axes, nor with our finger-nails,' said Gimli. 'But I will help as I may.'\n\nThey gathered such small boulders and broken stones as they could find to hand, and under Gimli's direction the Westfold-men blocked up the inner end of the culvert, until only a narrow outlet remained. Then the Deeping-stream, swollen by the rain, churned and fretted in its choked path, and spread slowly in cold pools from cliff to cliff.\n\n'It will be drier above,' said Gimli. 'Come, Gamling, let us see how things go on the wall!'\n\nHe climbed up and found Legolas beside Aragorn and Eomer. The elf was whetting his long knife. There was for a while a lull in the assault, since the attempt to break in through the culvert had been foiled.\n\n'Twenty-one!' said Gimli.\n\n'Good!' said Legolas. 'But my count is now two dozen. It has been knife-work up here.'\n\nEomer and Aragorn leant wearily on their swords. Away on the left the crash and clamour of the battle on the Rock rose loud again. But the Hornburg still held fast, like an island in the sea. Its gates lay in ruin; but over the barricade of beams and stones within no enemy as yet had passed.\n\nAragorn looked at the pale stars, and at the moon, now sloping behind the western hills that enclosed the valley. 'This is a night as long as years,' he said. 'How long will the day tarry?'\n\n'Dawn is not far off,' said Gamling, who had now climbed up beside him. 'But dawn will not help us, I fear.'\n\n'Yet dawn is ever the hope of men,' said Aragorn.\n\n'But these creatures of Isengard, these half-orcs and goblin-men that the foul craft of Saruman has bred, they will not quail at the sun,' said Gamling. 'And neither will the wild men of the hills. Do you not hear their voices?'\n\n'I hear them,' said Eomer; 'but they are only the scream of birds and the bellowing of beasts to my ears.'\n\n'Yet there are many that cry in the Dunland tongue,' said Gamling. 'I know that tongue. It is an ancient speech of men, and once was spoken in many western valleys of the Mark. Hark! They hate us, and they are glad; for our doom seems certain to them. 'The king, the king!' they cry. 'We will take their king. Death to the Forgoil! Death to the Strawheads! Death to the robbers of the North!' Such names they have for us. Not in half a thousand years have they forgotten their grievance that the lords of Gondor gave the Mark to Eorl the Young and made alliance with him. That old hatred Saruman has inflamed. They are fierce folk when roused. They will not give way now for dusk or dawn, until Theoden is taken, or they themselves are slain.'\n\n'Nonetheless day will bring hope to me,' said Aragorn. 'Is it not said that no foe has ever taken the Hornburg, if men defended it?'\n\n'So the minstrels say,' said Eomer.\n\n'Then let us defend it, and hope!' said Aragorn.\n\nEven as they spoke there came a blare of trumpets. Then there was a crash and a flash of flame and smoke. The waters of the Deeping-stream poured out hissing and foaming: they were choked no longer, a gaping hole was blasted in the wall. A host of dark shapes poured in.\n\n'Devilry of Saruman!' cried Aragorn. 'They have crept in the culvert again, while we talked, and they have lit the fire of Orthanc beneath our feet. 'Elendil, Elendil!' he shouted, as he leaped down into the breach; but even as he did so a hundred ladders were raised against the battlements. Over the wall and under the wall the last assault came sweeping like a dark wave upon a hill of sand. The defence was swept away. Some of the Riders were driven back, further and further into the Deep, falling and fighting as they gave way, step by step, towards the caves. Others cut their way back towards the citadel.\n\nA broad stairway, climbed from the Deep up to the Rock and the rear-gate of the Hornburg. Near the bottom stood Aragorn. In his hand still Anduril gleamed, and the terror of the sword for a while held back the enemy, as one by one all who could gain the stair passed up towards the gate. Behind on the upper steps knelt Legolas. His bow was bent, but one gleaned arrow was all that he had left, and he peered out now, ready to shoot the first Orc that should dare to approach the stair.\n\n'All who can have now got safe within, Aragorn,' he called. 'Come back!'\n\nAragorn turned and sped up the stair; but as he ran he stumbled in his weariness. At once his enemies leapt forward. Up came the Orcs, yelling, with their long arms stretched out to seize him. The foremost fell with Legolas' last arrow in his throat. but the rest sprang over him. Then a great boulder, cast from the outer wall above, crashed down upon the stair, and hurled them back into the Deep. Aragorn gained the door, and swiftly it clanged to behind him.\n\n'Things go ill, my friends,' he said, wiping the sweat from his brow with his arm.\n\n'Ill enough,' said Legolas, 'but not yet hopeless, while we have you with us. Where is Gimli?'\n\n'I do not know.' said Aragorn. 'I last saw him fighting on the ground behind the wall, but the enemy swept us apart.'\n\n'Alas! That is evil news,' said Legolas.\n\n'He is stout and strong,' said Aragorn. 'Let us hope that he will escape back to the caves. There he would be safe for a while. Safer than we. Such a refuge would be to the liking of a dwarf.'\n\n'That must be my hope,' said Legolas. 'But I wish that he had come this way. I desired to tell Master Gimli that my tale is now thirty-nine.'\n\n'If he wins back to the caves, he will pass your count again,' laughed Aragorn. 'Never did I see an axe so wielded.'\n\n'I must go and seek some arrows,' said Legolas. 'Would that this night would end, and I could have better light for shooting.'\n\nAragorn now passed into the citadel. There to his dismay he learned that Eomer had not reached the Hornburg.\n\n'Nay, he did not come to the Rock,' said one of the Westfold-men, 'I last saw him gathering men about him and fighting in the mouth of the Deep. Gamling was with him, and the dwarf; but I could not come to them.'\n\nAragorn strode on through the inner court, and mounted to a high chamber in the tower. There stood the king, dark against a narrow window, looking out upon the vale.\n\n'What is the news, Aragorn?' he said.\n\n'The Deeping Wall is taken, lord, and all the defence swept away; but many have escaped hither to the Rock.'\n\n'Is Eomer here?'\n\n'No, lord. But many of your men retreated into the Deep; and some say that Eomer was amongst them. In the narrows they may hold back the enemy and come within the caves. What hope they may have then I do not know.'\n\n'More than we. Good provision, it is said. And the air is wholesome there because of the outlets through fissures in the rock far above. None can force an entrance against determined men. They may hold out long.'\n\n'But the Orcs have brought a devilry from Orthanc,' said Aragorn. 'They have a blasting fire, and with it they took the Wall. If they cannot come in the caves, they may seal up those that are inside. But now we must turn all our thoughts to our own defence.'\n\n'I fret in this prison,' said Theoden. 'If I could have set a spear in rest, riding before my men upon the field, maybe I could have felt again the joy of battle, and so ended. But I serve little purpose here.'\n\n'Here at least you are guarded in the strongest fastness of the Mark,' said Aragorn. 'More hope we have to defend you in the Hornburg than in Edoras, or even at Dunharrow in the mountains.'\n\n'It is said that the Hornburg has never fallen to assault,' said Theoden; 'but now my heart is doubtful. The world changes, and all that once was strong now proves unsure. How shall any tower withstand such numbers and such reckless hate? Had I known that the strength of Isengard was grown so great, maybe l should not so rashly have ridden forth to meet it, for all the arts of Gandalf. His counsel seems not now so good as it did under the morning sun.'\n\n'Do not judge the counsel of Gandalf, until all is over, lord,' said Aragorn.\n\n'The end will not be long,' said the king. 'But I will not end here, taken like an old badger in a trap. Snowmane and Hasufel and the horses of my guard are in the inner court. When dawn comes, I will bid men sound Helm's horn, and I will ride forth. Will you ride with me then, son of Arathorn? Maybe we shall cleave a road, or make such an end as will be worth a song \u0426 if any be left to sing of us hereafter.'\n\n'I will ride with you,' said Aragorn.\n\nTaking his leave, he returned to the walls, and passed round all their circuit, enheartening the men, and lending aid wherever the assault was hot. Legolas went with him. Blasts of fire leaped up from below shaking the stones. Grappling-hooks were hurled, and ladders raised. Again and again the Orcs gained the summit of the outer wall, and again the defenders cast them down.\n\nAt last Aragorn stood above the great gates, heedless of the darts of the enemy. As he looked forth he saw the eastern sky grow pale. Then he raised his empty hand, palm outward in token of parley.\n\nThe Orcs yelled and jeered. 'Come down! Come down!' they cried. 'If you wish to speak to us, come down! Bring out your king! We are the fighting Uruk-hai. We will fetch him from his hole, if he does not come. Bring out your skulking king!'\n\n'The king stays or comes at his own will,' said Aragorn.\n\n'Then what are you doing here?' they answered. 'Why do you look out? Do you wish to see the greatness of our army? We are the fighting Uruk-hai.'\n\n'I looked out to see the dawn,' said Aragorn.\n\n'What of the dawn?' they jeered. 'We are the Uruk-hai: we do not stop the fight for night or day, for fair weather or for storm. We come to kill, by sun or moon. What of the dawn?'\n\n'None knows what the new day shall bring him,' said Aragorn. 'Get you gone, ere it turn to your evil.'\n\n'Get down or we will shoot you from the wall,' they cried. 'This is no parley. You have nothing to say.'\n\n'I have still this to say,' answered Aragorn. 'No enemy has yet taken the Hornburg. Depart, or not one of you will be spared. Not one will be left alive to take back tidings to the North. You do not know your peril.'\n\nSo great a power and royalty was revealed in Aragorn, as he stood there alone above the ruined gates before the host of his enemies, that many of the wild men paused, and looked back over their shoulders to the valley, and some looked up doubtfully at the sky. But the Orcs laughed with loud voices; and a hail of darts and arrows whistled over the wall, as Aragorn leaped down.\n\nThere was a roar and a blast of fire. The archway of the gate above which he had stood a moment before crumbled and crashed in smoke and dust. The barricade was scattered as if by a thunderbolt. Aragorn ran to the king's tower.\n\nBut even as the gate fell, and the Orcs about it yelled, preparing to charge, a murmur arose behind them, like a wind in the distance, and it grew to a clamour of many voices crying strange news in the dawn. The Orcs upon the Rock, hearing the rumour of dismay, wavered and looked back. And then, sudden and terrible, from the tower above, the sound of the great horn of Helm rang out.\n\nAll that heard that sound trembled. Many of the Orcs cast themselves on their faces and covered their ears with their claws. Back from the Deep the echoes came, blast upon blast, as if on every cliff and hill a mighty herald stood. But on the walls men looked up, listening with wonder; for the echoes did not die. Ever the horn-blasts wound on among the hills; nearer now and louder they answered one to another, blowing fierce and free.\n\n'Helm! Helm!' the Riders shouted. 'Helm is arisen and comes back to war. Helm for Theoden King!'\n\nAnd with that shout the king came. His horse was white as snow, golden was his shield, and his spear was long. At his right hand was Aragorn, Elendil's heir, behind him rode the lords of the House of Eorl the Young. Light sprang in the sky. Night departed.\n\n'Forth Eorlingas!' With a cry and a great noise they charged. Down from the gates they roared, over the causeway they swept, and they drove through the hosts of Isengard as a wind among grass. Behind them from the Deep came the stern cries of men issuing from the caves, driving forth the enemy. Out poured all the men that were left upon the Rock. And ever the sound of blowing horns echoed in the hills.\n\nOn they rode, the king and his companions. Captains and champions fell or fled before them. Neither orc nor man withstood them. Their backs were to the swords and spears of the Riders and their faces to the valley. They cried and wailed, for fear and great wonder had come upon them with the rising of the day.\n\nSo King Theoden rode from Helm's Gate and clove his path to the great Dike. There the company halted. Light grew bright about them. Shafts of the sun flared above the eastern hills and glimmered on their spears. But they sat silent on their horses, and they gazed down upon the Deeping-coomb.\n\nThe land had changed. Where before the green dale had lain, its grassy slopes lapping the ever-mounting hills, there now a forest loomed. Great trees, bare and silent, stood, rank on rank, with tangled bough and hoary head; their twisted roots were buried in the long green grass. Darkness was under them. Between the Dike and the eaves of that nameless wood only two open furlongs lay. There now cowered the proud hosts of Saruman, in terror of the king and in terror of the trees. They streamed down from Helm's Gate until all above the Dike was empty of them, but below it they were packed like swarming flies. Vainly they crawled and clambered about the walls of the coomb, seeking to escape. Upon the east too sheer and stony was the valley's side; upon the left, from the west, their final doom approached.\n\nThere suddenly upon a ridge appeared a rider, clad in white, shining in the rising sun. Over the low hills the horns were sounding. Behind him, hastening down the long slopes, were a thousand men on foot; their swords were in their hands. Amid them strode a man tall and strong. His shield was red. As he came to the valley's brink, he set to his lips a great black horn and blew a ringing blast.\n\n'Erkenbrand!' the Riders shouted. 'Erkenbrand!'\n\n'Behold the White Rider!' cried Aragorn. 'Gandalf is come again!'\n\n'Mithrandir, Mithrandir!' said Legolas. 'This is wizardry indeed! Come! I would look on this forest, ere the spell changes.'\n\nThe hosts of Isengard roared, swaying this way and that, turning from fear to fear. Again the horn sounded from the tower. Down through the breach of the Dike charged the king's company. Down from the hills leaped Erkenbrand, lord of Westfold. Down leaped Shadowfax, like a deer that runs surefooted in the mountains. The White Rider was upon them, and the terror of his coming filled the enemy with madness. The wild men fell on their faces before him. The Orcs reeled and screamed and cast aside both sword and spear. Like a black smoke driven by a mounting wind they fled. Wailing they passed under the waiting shadow of the trees; and from that shadow none ever came again.\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nThe Road to Isengard\n\nSo it was that in the light of a fair morning King Theoden and Gandalf the White Rider met again upon the green grass beside the Deeping-stream. There was also Aragorn son of Arathorn, and Legolas the Elf, and Erkenbrand of Westfold, and the lords of the Golden House. About them were gathered the Rohirrim, the Riders of the Mark: wonder overcame their joy in victory, and their eyes were turned towards the wood.\n\nSuddenly there was a great shout, and down from the Dike came those who had been driven back into the Deep. There came Gamling the Old, and Eomer son of Eomund, and beside them walked Gimli the dwarf. He had no helm, and about his head was a linen band stained with blood; but his voice was loud and strong.\n\n'Forty-two, Master Legolas!' he cried. 'Alas! My axe is notched: the forty-second had an iron collar on his neck. How is it with you?'\n\n'You have passed my score by one,' answered Legolas. 'But I do not grudge you the game, so glad am I to see you on your legs!'\n\n'Welcome, Eomer, sister-son!' said Theoden. 'Now that I see you safe, I am glad indeed.'\n\n'Hail, Lord of the Mark!' said Eomer. 'The dark night has passed and day has come again. But the day has brought strange tidings.' He turned and gazed in wonder, first at the wood and then at Gandalf. 'Once more you come in the hour of need, unlooked-for,' he said.\n\n'Unlooked-for?' said Gandalf. 'I said that I would return and meet you here.'\n\n'But you did not name the hour, nor foretell the manner of your coming. Strange help you bring. You are mighty in wizardry, Gandalf the White!'\n\n'That may be. But if so, I have not shown it yet. I have but given good counsel in peril, and made use of the speed of Shadowfax. Your own valour has done more, and the stout legs of the Westfold-men marching through the night.'\n\nThen they all gazed at Gandalf with still greater wonder. Some glanced darkly at the wood, and passed their hands over their brows, as if they thought their eyes saw otherwise than his.\n\nGandalf laughed long and merrily. 'The trees?' he said. 'Nay, I see the wood as plainly as do you. But that is no deed of mine. It is a thing beyond the counsel of the wise. Better than my design, and better even than my hope the event has proved.'\n\n'Then if not yours, whose is the wizardry?' said Theoden. 'Not Saruman's, that is plain. Is there some mightier sage, of whom we have yet to learn?'\n\n'It is not wizardry, but a power far older,' said Gandalf: 'a power that walked the earth, ere elf sang or hammer rang.\n\n\t\tEre iron was found or tree was hewn,\n\t\tWhen young was mountain under moon;\n\t\tEre ring was made, or wrought was woe,\n\t\tIt walked the forests long ago.'\n\n'And what may be the answer to your riddle?' said Theoden.\n\n'If you would learn that, you should come with me to Isengard,' answered Gandalf.\n\n'To Isengard?' they cried.\n\n'Yes,' said Gandalf. 'I shall return to Isengard, and those who will may come with me. There we may see strange things.'\n\n'But there are not men enough in the Mark, not if they were all gathered together and healed of wounds and weariness, to assault the stronghold of Saruman,' said Theoden.\n\n'Nevertheless to Isengard I go,' said Gandalf. 'I shall not stay there long. My way lies now eastward. Look for me in Edoras, ere the waning of the moon!'\n\n'Nay!' said Theoden. 'In the dark hour before dawn I doubted, but we will not part now. I will come with you, if that is your counsel.'\n\n'I wish to speak with Saruman, as soon as may be now,' said Gandalf, 'and since he has done you great injury, it would be fitting if you were there. But how soon and how swiftly will you ride?'\n\n'My men are weary with battle,' said the King, 'and I am weary also. For I have ridden far and slept little. Alas! My old age is not feigned nor due only to the whisperings of Wormtongue. It is an ill that no leech can wholly cure, not even Gandalf.'\n\n'Then let all who are to ride with me rest now,' said Gandalf. 'We will journey under the shadow of evening. It is as well; for it is my counsel that all our comings and goings should be as secret as may be, henceforth. But do not command many men to go with you, Theoden. We go to a parley not to a fight.'\n\nThe King then chose men that were unhurt and had swift horses, and he sent them forth with tidings of the victory into every vale of the Mark; and they bore his summons also, bidding all men, young and old, to come in haste to Edoras. There the Lord of the Mark would hold an assembly of all that could bear arms, on the second day after the full moon. To ride with him to Isengard the King chose Eomer and twenty men of his household. With Gandalf would go Aragorn, and Legolas, and Gimli. In spite of his hurt the dwarf would not stay behind.\n\n'It was only a feeble blow and the cap turned it,' he said. 'It would take more than such an orc-scratch to keep me back.'\n\n'I will tend it, while you rest,' said Aragorn.\n\nThe king now returned to the Hornburg, and slept, such a sleep of quiet as he had not known for many years, and the remainder of his chosen company rested also. But the others, all that were not hurt or wounded, began a great labour; for many had fallen in the battle and lay dead upon the field or in the Deep.\n\nNo Orcs remained alive; their bodies were uncounted. But a great many of the hillmen had given themselves up; and they were afraid, and cried for mercy.\n\nThe Men of the Mark took their weapons from them, and set them to work.\n\n'Help now to repair the evil in which you have joined,' said Erkenbrand, 'and afterwards you shall take an oath never again to pass the Fords of Isen in arms, nor to march with the enemies of Men; and then you shall go free back to your land. For you have been deluded by Saruman. Many of you have got death as the reward of your trust in him; but had you conquered, little better would your wages have been.'\n\nThe men of Dunland were amazed, for Saruman had told them that the men of Rohan were cruel and burned their captives alive.\n\nIn the midst of the field before the Hornburg two mounds were raised, and beneath them were laid all the Riders of the Mark who fell in the defence, those of the East Dales upon one side, and those of Westfold upon the other. In a grave alone under the shadow of the Hornburg lay Hama, captain of the King's guard. He fell before the Gate.\n\nThe Orcs were piled in great heaps, away from the mounds of Men, not far from the eaves of the forest. And the people were troubled in their minds; for the heaps of carrion were too great for burial or for burning. They had little wood for firing, and none would have dared to take an axe to the strange trees, even if Gandalf had not warned them to hurt neither bark nor bough at their great peril.\n\n'Let the Orcs lie,' said Gandalf. 'The morning may bring new counsel.'\n\nIn the afternoon the King's company prepared to depart. The work of burial was then but beginning; and Theoden mourned for the loss of Hama, his captain, and cast the first earth upon his grave. 'Great injury indeed has Saruman done to me and all this land,' he said, 'and I will remember it, when we meet.'\n\nThe sun was already drawing near the hills upon the west of the Coomb, when at last Theoden and Gandalf and their companions rode down from the Dike. Behind them were gathered a great host, both of the Riders and of the people of Westfold, old and young, women and children, who had come out from the caves. A song of victory they sang with clear voices; and then they fell silent, wondering what would chance, for their eyes were on the trees and they feared them.\n\nThe Riders came to the wood, and they halted; horse and man, they were unwilling to pass in. The trees were grey and menacing, and a shadow or a mist was about them. The ends of their long sweeping boughs hung down like searching fingers, their roots stood up from the ground like the limbs of strange monsters, and dark caverns opened beneath them. But Gandalf went forward, leading the company, and where the road from the Hornburg met the trees they saw now an opening like an arched gate under mighty boughs; and through it Gandalf passed, and they followed him. Then to their amazement they found that the road ran on, and the Deeping-stream beside it; and the sky was open above and full of golden light. But on either side the great aisles of the wood were already wrapped in dusk, stretching away into impenetrable shadows; and there they heard the creaking and groaning of boughs, and far cries, and a rumour of wordless voices, murmuring angrily. No Orc or other living creature could be seen.\n\nLegolas and Gimli were now riding together upon one horse; and they kept close beside Gandalf, for Gimli was afraid of the wood.\n\n'It is hot in here,' said Legolas to Gandalf. 'I feel a great wrath about me. Do you not feel the air throb in your ears?'\n\n'Yes,' said Gandalf.\n\n'What has become of the miserable Orcs?' said Legolas.\n\n'That, I think, no one will ever know,' said Gandalf.\n\nThey rode in silence for a while; but Legolas was ever glancing from side to side, and would often have halted to listen to the sounds of the wood, if Gimli had allowed it.\n\n'These are the strangest trees that ever I saw,' he said, 'and I have seen many an oak grow from acorn to ruinous age. I wish that there were leisure now to walk among them: they have voices, and in time I might come to understand their thought.'\n\n'No, no!' said Gimli. 'Let us leave them! I guess their thought already: hatred of all that go on two legs; and their speech is of crushing and strangling.'\n\n'Not of all that go on two legs,' said Legolas. 'There I think you are wrong. It is Orcs that they hate. For they do not belong here and know little of Elves and Men. Far away are the valleys where they sprang. From the deep dales of Fangorn, Gimli, that is whence they come, I guess.'\n\n'Then that is the most perilous wood in Middle-earth,' said Gimli. 'I should be grateful for the part they have played, but I do not love them. You may think them wonderful, but I have seen a greater wonder in this land, more beautiful than any grove or glade that ever grew: my heart is still full of it.\n\n'Strange are the ways of Men, Legolas! Here they have one of the marvels of the Northern World, and what do they say of it? Caves, they say! Caves! Holes to fly to in time of war, to store fodder in! My good Legolas, do you know that the caverns of Helm's Deep are vast and beautiful? There would be an endless pilgrimage of Dwarves, merely to gaze at them, if such things were known to be. Aye indeed, they would pay pure gold for a brief glance!'\n\n'And I would give gold to be excused,' said Legolas, 'and double to be let out, if I strayed in!'\n\n'You have not seen, so I forgive your jest,' said Gimli. 'But you speak like a fool. Do you think those halls are fair, where your King dwells under the hill in Mirkwood, and Dwarves helped in their making long ago? They are but hovels compared with the caverns I have seen here: immeasurable halls, filled with an everlasting music of water that tinkles into pools, as fair as Kheled-zaram in the starlight.\n\n'And, Legolas, when the torches are kindled and men walk on the sandy floors under the echoing domes, ah! then, Legolas, gems and crystals and veins of precious ore glint in the polished walls; and the light glows through folded marbles, shell-like, translucent as the living hands of Queen Galadriel. There are columns of white and saffron and dawn-rose, Legolas, fluted and twisted into dreamlike forms; they spring up from many-coloured floors to meet the glistening pendants of the roof: wings, ropes, curtains fine as frozen clouds; spears, banners, pinnacles of suspended palaces! Still lakes mirror them: a glimmering world looks up from dark pools covered with clear glass; cities, such as the mind of Durin could scarce have imagined in his sleep, stretch on through avenues and pillared courts, on into the dark recesses where no light can come. And plink! a silver drop falls, and the round wrinkles in the glass make all the towers bend and waver like weeds and corals in a grotto of the sea. Then evening comes: they fade and twinkle out; the torches pass on into another chamber and another dream. There is chamber after chamber, Legolas; hall opening out of hall, dome after dome, stair beyond stair; and still the winding paths lead on into the mountains' heart. Caves! The Caverns of Helm's Deep! Happy was the chance that drove me there! It makes me weep to leave them.'\n\n'Then I will wish you this fortune for your comfort, Gimli,' said the Elf, 'that you may come safe from war and return to see them again. But do not tell all your kindred! There seems little left for them to do, from your account. Maybe the men of this land are wise to say little: one family of busy dwarves with hammer and chisel might mar more than they made.'\n\n'No, you do not understand,' said Gimli. 'No dwarf could be unmoved by such loveliness. None of Durin's race would mine those caves for stones or ore, not if diamonds and gold could be got there. Do you cut down groves of blossoming trees in the spring-time for firewood? We would tend these glades of flowering stone, not quarry them. With cautious skill, tap by tap \u0426 a small chip of rock and no more, perhaps, in a whole anxious day \u0426 so we could work, and as the years went by, we should open up new ways, and display far chambers that are still dark, glimpsed only as a void beyond fissures in the rock. And lights, Legolas! We should make lights, such lamps as once shone in Khazad-dum; and when we wished we would drive away the night that has lain there since the hills were made; and when we desired rest, we would let the night return.'\n\n'You move me, Gimli,' said Legolas. 'I have never heard you speak like this before. Almost you make me regret that I have not seen these caves. Come! Let us make this bargain \u0426 if we both return safe out of the perils that await us, we will journey for a while together. You shall visit Fangorn with me, and then I will come with you to see Helm's Deep.'\n\n'That would not be the way of return that I should choose,' said Gimli. 'But I will endure Fangorn, if I have your promise to come back to the caves and share their wonder with me.'\n\n'You have my promise,' said Legolas. 'But alas! Now we must leave behind both cave and wood for a while: See! We are coming to the end of the trees. How far is it to Isengard, Gandalf?'\n\n'About fifteen leagues, as the crows of Saruman make it,' said Gandalf, 'five from the mouth of Deeping-coomb to the Fords, and ten more from there to the gates of Isengard. But we shall not ride all the way this night.'\n\n'And when we come there, what shall we see?' asked Gimli. 'You may know, but I cannot guess.'\n\n'I do not know myself for certain,' answered the wizard. 'I was there at nightfall yesterday, but much may have happened since. Yet I think that you will not say that the journey was in vain \u0426 not though the Glittering Caves of Aglarond be left behind.'\n\nAt last the company passed through the trees, and found that they had come to the bottom of the Coomb, where the road from Helm's Deep branched, going one way east to Edoras, and the other north to the Fords of Isen. As they rode from under the eaves of the wood, Legolas halted and looked back with regret. Then he gave a sudden cry.\n\n'There are eyes!' he said. 'Eyes looking out from the shadows of the boughs! I never saw such eyes before.'\n\nThe others, surprised by his cry, halted and turned; but Legolas started to ride back.\n\n'No, no!' cried Gimli. 'Do as you please in your madness, but let me first get down from this horse! I wish to see no eyes!'\n\n'Stay, Legolas Greenleaf!' said Gandalf. 'Do not go back into the wood, not yet! Now is not your time.'\n\nEven as he spoke, there came forward out of the trees three strange shapes. As tall as trolls they were, twelve feet or more in height; their strong bodies, stout as young trees, seemed to be clad with raiment or with hide of close-fitting grey and brown. Their limbs were long, and their hands had many fingers; their hair was stiff, and their beards grey-green as moss. They gazed out with solemn eyes, but they were not looking at the riders: their eyes were bent northwards. Suddenly they lifted their long hands to their mouths, and sent forth ringing calls, clear as notes of a horn, but more musical and various. The calls were answered; and turning again, the riders saw other creatures of the same kind approaching, striding through the grass. They came swiftly from the North, walking like wading herons in their gait, but not in their speed; for their legs in their long paces beat quicker than the heron's wings. The riders cried aloud in wonder, and some set their hands upon their sword-hilts.\n\n'You need no weapons,' said Gandalf. 'These are but herdsmen. They are not enemies, indeed they are not concerned with us at all.'\n\nSo it seemed to be; for as he spoke the tall creatures, without a glance at the riders, strode into the wood and vanished.\n\n'Herdsmen!' said Theoden. 'Where are their flocks? What are they, Gandalf? For it is plain that to you, at any rate, they are not strange.'\n\n'They are the shepherds of the trees,' answered Gandalf. 'Is it so long since you listened to tales by the fireside? There are children in your land who, out of the twisted threads of story, could pick the answer to your question. You have seen Ents, O King, Ents out of Fangorn Forest, which in your tongue you call the Entwood. Did you think that the name was given only in idle fancy? Nay, Theoden, it is otherwise: to them you are but the passing tale; all the years from Eorl the Young to Theoden the Old are of little count to them; and all the deeds of your house but a small matter.'\n\nThe king was silent. 'Ents!' he said at length. 'Out of the shadows of legend I begin a little to understand the marvel of the trees, I think. I have lived to see strange days. Long we have tended our beasts and our fields, built our houses, wrought our tools, or ridden away to help in the wars of Minas Tirith. And that we called the life of Men, the way of the world. We cared little for what lay beyond the borders of our land. Songs we have that tell of these things, but we are forgetting them, teaching them only to children, as a careless custom. And now the songs have come down among us out of strange places, and walk visible under the Sun.'\n\n'You should be glad, Theoden King,' said Gandalf. 'For not only the little life of Men is now endangered, but the life also of those things which you have deemed the matter of legend. You are not without allies, even if you know them not.'\n\n'Yet also I should be sad,' said Theoden. 'For however the fortune of war shall go, may it not so end that much that was fair and wonderful shall pass for ever out of Middle-earth?'\n\n'It may,' said Gandalf. 'The evil of Sauron cannot be wholly cured, nor made as if it had not been. But to such days we are doomed. Let us now go on with the journey we have begun!'\n\nThe company turned then away from the Coomb and from the wood and took the road towards the Fords. Legolas followed reluctantly. The sun had set, already it had sunk behind the rim of the world; but as they rode out from the shadow of the hills and looked west to the Gap of Rohan the sky was still red, and a burning light was under the floating clouds. Dark against it there wheeled and flew many black-winged birds. Some passed overhead with mournful cries, returning to their homes among the rocks.\n\n'The carrion-fowl have been busy about the battle-field,' said Eomer.\n\nThey rode now at an easy pace and dark came down upon the plains about them. The slow moon mounted, now waxing towards the full, and in its cold silver light the swelling grass-lands rose and fell like a wide grey sea. They had ridden for some four hours from the branching of the roads when they drew near to the Fords. Long slopes ran swiftly down to where the river spread in stony shoals between high grassy terraces. Borne upon the wind they heard the howling of wolves. Their hearts were heavy, remembering the many men that had fallen in battle in this place.\n\nThe road dipped between rising turf-banks, carving its way through the terraces to the river's edge, and up again upon the further side. There were three lines of flat stepping-stones across the stream, and between them fords for horses, that went from either brink to a bare eyot in the midst. The riders looked down upon the crossings, and it seemed strange to them; for the Fords had ever been a place full of the rush and chatter of water upon stones; but now they were silent. The beds of the stream were almost dry, a bare waste of shingles and grey sand.\n\n'This is become a dreary place,' said Eomer. 'What sickness has befallen the river? Many fair things Saruman has destroyed: has he devoured the springs of Isen too?'\n\n'So it would seem,' said Gandalf.\n\n'Alas!' said Theoden. 'Must we pass this way, where the carrion-beasts devour so many good Riders of the Mark?'\n\n'This is our way,' said Gandalf. 'Grievous is the fall of your men; but you shall see that at least the wolves of the mountains do not devour them. It is with their friends, the Orcs, that they hold their feast: such indeed is the friendship of their kind. Come!'\n\nThey rode down to the river, and as they came the wolves ceased their howling and slunk away. Fear fell on them seeing Gandalf in the moon, and Shadowfax his horse shining like silver. The riders passed over to the islet, and glittering eyes watched them wanly from the shadows of the banks.\n\n'Look!' said Gandalf. 'Friends have laboured here.'\n\nAnd they saw that in the midst of the eyot a mound was piled, ringed with stones, and set about with many spears.\n\n'Here lie all the Men of the Mark that fell near this place,' said Gandalf.\n\n'Here let them rest!' said Eomer. 'And when their spears have rotted and rusted, long still may their mound stand and guard the Fords of Isen!'\n\n'Is this your work also, Gandalf, my friend?' said Theoden. 'You accomplished much in an evening and a night!'\n\n'With the help of Shadowfax \u0426 and others,' said Gandalf. 'I rode fast and far. But here beside the mound I will say this for your comfort: many fell in the battles of the Fords, but fewer than rumour made them. More were scattered than were slain; I gathered together all that I could find. Some men I sent with Grimbold of Westfold to join Erkenbrand. Some I set to make this burial. They have now followed your marshal, Elfhelm. I sent him with many Riders to Edoras. Saruman I knew had despatched his full strength against you, and his servants had turned aside from all other errands and gone to Helm's Deep: the lands seemed empty of enemies; yet I feared that wolf-riders and plunderers might ride nonetheless to Meduseld, while it was undefended. But now I think you need not fear: you will find your house to welcome your return.'\n\n'And glad shall I be to see it again,' said Theoden, 'though brief now, I doubt not, shall be my abiding there.'\n\nWith that the company said farewell to the island and the mound, and passed over the river, and climbed the further bank. Then they rode on, glad to have left the mournful Fords. As they went the howling of the wolves broke out anew.\n\nThere was an ancient highway that ran down from Isengard to the crossings. For some way it took its course beside the river, bending with it east and then north; but at the last it turned away and went straight towards the gates of Isengard; and these were under the mountain-side in the west of the valley, sixteen miles or more from its mouth. This road they followed but they did not ride upon it; for the ground beside it was firm and level, covered for many miles about with short springing turf. They rode now more swiftly, and by midnight the Fords were nearly five leagues behind. Then they halted, ending their night's journey, for the King was weary. They were come to the feet of the Misty Mountains, and the long arms of Nan Curunir stretched down to meet them. Dark lay the vale before them, for the moon had passed into the West, and its light was hidden by the hills. But out of the deep shadow of the dale rose a vast spire of smoke and vapour; as it mounted, it caught the rays of the sinking moon, and spread in shimmering billows, black and silver, over the starry sky.\n\n'What do you think of that, Gandalf?' asked Aragorn. 'One would say that all the Wizard's Vale was burning.'\n\n'There is ever a fume above that valley in these days,' said Eomer, 'but I have never seen aught like this before. These are steams rather than smokes. Saruman is brewing some devilry to greet us. Maybe he is boiling all the waters of Isen, and that is why the river runs dry.'\n\n'Maybe he is,' said Gandalf. 'Tomorrow we shall learn what he is doing. Now let us rest for a while, if we can.'\n\nThey camped beside the bed of the Isen river; it was still silent and empty. Some of them slept a little. But late in the night the watchmen cried out, and all awoke. The moon was gone. Stars were shining above; but over the ground there crept a darkness blacker than the night. On both sides of the river it rolled towards them, going northward.\n\n'Stay where you are!' said Gandalf. 'Draw no weapons! Wait! and it will pass you by!'\n\nA mist gathered about them. Above them a few stars still glimmered faintly; but on either side there arose walls of impenetrable gloom; they were in a narrow lane between moving towers of shadow. Voices they heard, whisperings and groanings and an endless rustling sigh; the earth shook under them. Long it seemed to them that they sat and were afraid; but at last the darkness and the rumour passed, and vanished between the mountain's arms.\n\nAway south upon the Hornburg, in the middle night men heard a great noise, as a wind in the valley, and the ground trembled; and all were afraid and no one ventured to go forth. But in the morning they went out and were amazed; for the slain Orcs were gone, and the trees also. Far down into the valley of the Deep the grass was crushed and trampled brown, as if giant herdsmen had pastured great droves of cattle there; but a mile below the Dike a huge pit had been delved in the earth, and over it stones were piled into a hill. Men believed that the Orcs whom they had slain were buried there; but whether those who had fled into the wood were with them, none could say, for no man ever set foot upon that hill. The Death Down it was afterwards called, and no grass would grow there. But the strange trees were never seen in Deeping-coomb again; they had returned at night, and had gone far away to the dark dales of Fangorn. Thus they were revenged upon the Orcs.\n\nThe king and his company slept no more that night; but they saw and heard no other strange thing, save one: the voice of the river beside them suddenly awoke. There was a rush of water hurrying down among the stones; and when it had passed, the Isen flowed and bubbled in its bed again, as it had ever done.\n\nAt dawn they made ready to go on. The light came grey and pale, and they did not see the rising of the sun. The air above was heavy with fog, and a reek lay on the land about them. They went slowly, riding now upon the highway. It was broad and hard, and well-tended. Dimly through the mists they could descry the long arm of the mountains rising on their left. They had passed into Nan Curunir, the Wizard's Vale. That was a sheltered valley, open only to the South. Once it had been fair and green, and through it the Isen flowed, already deep and strong before it found the plains; for it was fed by many springs and lesser streams among the rain-washed hills, and all about it there had lain a pleasant, fertile land.\n\nIt was not so now. Beneath the walls of Isengard there still were acres tilled by the slaves of Saruman; but most of the valley had become a wilderness of weeds and thorns. Brambles trailed upon the ground, or clambering over bush and bank, made shaggy caves where small beasts housed. No trees grew there; but among the rank grasses could still be seen the burned and axe-hewn stumps of ancient groves. It was a sad country, silent now but for the stony noise of quick waters. Smokes and steams drifted in sullen clouds and lurked in the hollows. The riders did not speak. Many doubted in their hearts, wondering to what dismal end their journey led.\n\nAfter they had ridden for some miles, the highway became a wide street, paved with great flat stones, squared and laid with skill; no blade of grass was seen in any joint. Deep gutters, filled with trickling water, ran down on either side. Suddenly a tall pillar loomed up before them. It was black; and set upon it was a great stone, carved and painted in the likeness of a long White Hand. Its finger pointed north. Not far now they knew that the gates of Isengard must stand, and their hearts were heavy; but their eyes could not pierce the mists ahead.\n\nBeneath the mountain's arm within the Wizard's Vale through years uncounted had stood that ancient place that Men called Isengard. Partly it was shaped in the making of the mountains, but mighty works the Men of Westernesse had wrought there of old; and Saruman had dwelt there long and had not been idle.\n\nThis was its fashion, while Saruman was at his height, accounted by many the chief of Wizards. A great ring-wall of stone, like towering cliffs, stood out from the shelter of the mountain-side, from which it ran and then returned again. One entrance only was there made in it, a great arch delved in the southern wall. Here through the black rock a long tunnel had been hewn, closed at either end with mighty doors of iron. They were so wrought and poised upon their huge hinges, posts of steel driven into the living stone, that when unbarred they could be moved with a light thrust of the arms, noiselessly. One who passed in and came at length out of the echoing tunnel, beheld a plain, a great circle, somewhat hollowed like a vast shallow bowl: a mile it measured from rim to rim. Once it had been green and filled with avenues, and groves of fruitful trees, watered by streams that flowed from the mountains to a lake. But no green thing grew there in the latter days of Saruman. The roads were paved with stone-flags, dark and hard; and beside their borders instead of trees there marched long lines of pillars, some of marble, some of copper and of iron. joined by heavy chains.\n\nMany houses there were, chambers, halls, and passages, cut and tunnelled back into the walls upon their inner side, so that all the open circle was overlooked by countless windows and dark doors. Thousands could dwell there, workers, servants, slaves, and warriors with great store of arms; wolves were fed and stabled in deep dens beneath. The plain, too, was bored and delved. Shafts were driven deep into the ground; their upper ends were covered by low mounds and domes of stone, so that in the moonlight the Ring of Isengard looked like a graveyard of unquiet dead. For the ground trembled. The shafts ran down by many slopes and spiral stairs to caverns far under; there Saruman had treasuries, store-houses, armouries, smithies, and great furnaces. Iron wheels revolved there endlessly, and hammers thudded. At night plumes of vapour steamed from the vents, lit from beneath with red light, or blue, or venomous green.\n\nTo the centre all the roads ran between their chains. There stood a tower of marvellous shape. It was fashioned by the builders of old, who smoothed the Ring of Isengard, and yet it seemed a thing not made by the craft of Men, but riven from the bones of the earth in the ancient torment of the hills. A peak and isle of rock it was, black and gleaming hard: four mighty piers of many-sided stone were welded into one, but near the summit they opened into gaping horns. their pinnacles sharp as the points of spears, keen-edged as knives. Between them was a narrow space, and there upon a floor of polished stone, written with strange signs, a man might stand five hundred feet above the plain. This was Orthanc, the citadel of Saruman, the name of which had (by design or chance) a twofold meaning; for in the Elvish speech orthanc signifies Mount Fang, but in the language of the Mark of old the Cunning Mind.\n\nA strong place and wonderful was Isengard, and long it had been beautiful; and there great lords had dwelt, the wardens of Gondor upon the West, and wise men that watched the stars. But Saruman had slowly shaped it to his shifting purposes, and made it better, as he thought, being deceived \u0426 for all those arts and subtle devices, for which he forsook his former wisdom, and which fondly he imagined were his own, came but from Mordor; so that what he made was naught, only a little copy, a child's model or a slave's flattery, of that vast fortress. Armoury, prison, furnace of great power, Barad-dur, the Dark Tower, which suffered no rival, and laughed at flattery, biding its time, secure in its pride and its immeasurable strength.\n\nThis was the stronghold of Saruman, as fame reported it; for within living memory the men of Rohan had not passed its gates, save perhaps a few, such as Wormtongue, who came in secret and told no man what they saw.\n\nNow Gandalf rode to the great pillar of the Hand, and passed it: and as he did so the Riders saw to their wonder that the Hand appeared no longer white. It was stained as with dried blood; and looking closer they perceived that its nails were red. Unheeding Gandalf rode on into the mist, and reluctantly they followed him. All about them now, as if there had been a sudden flood, wide pools of water lay beside the road, filling the hollows, and rills went trickling down among the stones.\n\nAt last Gandalf halted and beckoned to them; and they came, and saw that beyond him the mists had cleared, and a pale sunlight shone. The hour of noon had passed. They were come to the doors of Isengard.\n\nBut the doors lay hurled and twisted on the ground. And all about, stone, cracked and splintered into countless jagged shards, was scattered far and wide, or piled in ruinous heaps. The great arch still stood, but it opened now upon a roofless chasm: the tunnel was laid bare, and through the cliff-like walls on either side great rents and breaches had been torn; their towers were beaten into dust. If the Great Sea had risen in wrath and fallen on the hills with storm, it could have worked no greater ruin.\n\nThe ring beyond was filled with steaming water: a bubbling cauldron, in which there heaved and floated a wreckage of beams and spars, chests and casks and broken gear. Twisted and leaning pillars reared their splintered stems above the flood, but all the roads were drowned. Far off, it seemed, half veiled in winding cloud, there loomed the island rock. Still dark and tall, unbroken by the storm, the tower of Orthanc stood. Pale waters lapped about its feet.\n\nThe king and all his company sat silent on their horses, marvelling, perceiving that the power of Saruman was overthrown; but how they could not guess. And now they turned their eyes towards the archway and the ruined gates. There they saw close beside them a great rubble-heap; and suddenly they were aware of two small figures lying on it at their ease, grey-clad, hardly to be seen among the stones. There were bottles and bowls and platters laid beside them, as if they had just eaten well, and now rested from their labour. One seemed asleep; the other, with crossed legs and arms behind his head, leaned back against a broken rock and sent from his mouth long wisps and little rings of thin blue smoke.\n\nFor a moment Theoden and Eomer and all his men stared at them in wonder. Amid all the wreck of Isengard this seemed to them the strangest sight. But before the king could speak, the small smoke-breathing figure became suddenly aware of them, as they sat there silent on the edge of the mist. He sprang to his feet. A young man he looked, or like one, though not much more than half a man in height; his head of brown curling hair was uncovered, but he was clad in a travel-stained cloak of the same hue and shape as the companions of Gandalf had worn when they rode to Edoras. He bowed very low, putting his hand upon his breast. Then, seeming not to observe the wizard and his friends, he turned to Eomer and the king.\n\n'Welcome, my lords, to Isengard!' he said. 'We are the doorwardens. Meriadoc, son of Saradoc is my name; and my companion, who, alas! is overcome with weariness' \u0426 here he gave the other a dig with his foot \u0426 'is Peregrin, son of Paladin, of the house of Took. Far in the North is our home. The Lord Saruman is within; but at the moment he is closeted with one Wormtongue, or doubtless he would be here to welcome such honourable guests.'\n\n'Doubtless he would!' laughed Gandalf. 'And was it Saruman that ordered you to guard his damaged doors, and watch for the arrival of guests, when your attention could be spared from plate and bottle?'\n\n'No, good sir, the matter escaped him,' answered Merry gravely. 'He has been much occupied. Our orders came from Treebeard, who has taken over the management of Isengard. He commanded me to welcome the Lord of Rohan with fitting words. I have done my best.'\n\n'And what about your companions? What about Legolas and me?' cried Gimli, unable to contain himself longer. 'You rascals, you woolly-footed and wool-pated truants! A fine hunt you have led us! Two hundred leagues, through fen and forest, battle and death, to rescue you! And here we find you feasting and idling \u0426 and smoking! Smoking! Where did you come by the weed, you villains? Hammer and tongs! I am so torn between rage and joy, that if I do not burst, it will be a marvel!'\n\n'You speak for me, Gimli,' laughed Legolas. 'Though I would sooner learn how they came by the wine.'\n\n'One thing you have not found in your hunting, and that's brighter wits,' said Pippin, opening an eye. 'Here you find us sitting on a field of victory, amid the plunder of armies, and you wonder how we came by a few well-earned comforts!'\n\n'Well-earned?' said Gimli. 'I cannot believe that!'\n\nThe Riders laughed. 'It cannot be doubted that we witness the meeting of dear friends,' said Theoden. 'So these are the lost ones of your company, Gandalf? The days are fated to be filled with marvels. Already I have seen many since I left my house; and now here before my eyes stand yet another of the folk of legend. Are not these the Halflings, that some among us call the Holbytlan?'\n\n'Hobbits, if you please, lord,' said Pippin.\n\n'Hobbits?' said Theoden. 'Your tongue is strangely changed; but the name sounds not unfitting so. Hobbits! No report that I have heard does justice to the truth.'\n\nMerry bowed; and Pippin got up and bowed low. 'You are gracious, lord; or I hope that I may so take your words,' he said. 'And here is another marvel! I have wandered in many lands, since I left my home, and never till now have I found people that knew any story concerning hobbits.'\n\n'My people came out of the North long ago,' said Theoden. 'But I will not deceive you: we know no tales about hobbits. All that is said among us is that far away, over many hills and rivers, live the halfling folk that dwell in holes in sand-dunes. But there are no legends of their deeds. for it is said that they do little, and avoid the sight of men, being able to vanish in a twinkling: and they can change their voices to resemble the piping of birds. But it seems that more could be said.'\n\n'It could indeed, lord,' said Merry.\n\n'For one thing,' said Theoden, 'I had not heard that they spouted smoke from their mouths.'\n\n'That is not surprising,' answered Merry; 'for it is an art which we have not practised for more than a few generations. It was Tobold Hornblower, of Longbottom in the Southfarthing, who first grew the true pipe-weed in his gardens, about the year 1070 according to our reckoning. How old Toby came by the plant\u0415'\n\n'You do not know your danger, Theoden,' interrupted Gandalf. 'These hobbits will sit on the edge of ruin and discuss the pleasures of the table, or the small doings of their fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers, and remoter cousins to the ninth degree, if you encourage them with undue patience. Some other time would be more fitting for the history of smoking. Where is Treebeard, Merry?'\n\n'Away on the north side, I believe. He went to get a drink of clean water. Most of the other Ents are with him, still busy at their work \u0426 over there.' Merry waved his hand towards the steaming lake; and as they looked, they heard a distant rumbling and rattling, as if an avalanche was falling from the mountain-side. Far away came a hoom-hom, as of horns blowing triumphantly.\n\n'And is Orthanc then left unguarded?' asked Gandalf.\n\n'There is the water,' said Merry. 'But Quickbeam and some others are watching it. Not all those posts and pillars in the plain are of Saruman's planting. Quickbeam, I think, is by the rock, near the foot of the stair.'\n\n'Yes, a tall grey Ent is there,' said Legolas, 'but his arms are at his sides, and he stands as still as a door-tree.'\n\n'It is past noon,' said Gandalf, 'and we at any rate have not eaten since early morning. Yet I wish to see Treebeard as soon as may be. Did he leave me no message, or has plate and bottle driven it from your mind?'\n\n'He left a message,' said Merry, 'and I was coming to it, but I have been hindered by many other questions. I was to say that, if the Lord of the Mark and Gandalf will ride to the northern wall they will find Treebeard there, and he will welcome them. I may add that they will also find food of the best there, it was discovered and selected by your humble servants.' He bowed.\n\nGandalf laughed. 'That is better!' he said. 'Well, Theoden, will you ride with me to find Treebeard? We must go round about, but it is not far. When you see Treebeard, you will learn much. For Treebeard is Fangorn, and the eldest and chief of the Ents, and when you speak with him you will hear the speech of the oldest of all living things.'\n\n'I will come with you,' said Theoden. 'Farewell, my hobbits! May we meet again in my house! There you shall sit beside me and tell me all that your hearts desire: the deeds of your grandsires, as far as you can reckon them; and we will speak also of Tobold the Old and his herb-lore. Farewell!'\n\nThe hobbits bowed low. 'So that is the King of Rohan!' said Pippin in an undertone. 'A fine old fellow. Very polite.'\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nFlotsam and Jetsam\n\nGandalf and the King's company rode away, turning eastward to make the circuit of the ruined walls of Isengard. But Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas remained behind. Leaving Arod and Hasufel to stray in search of grass, they came and sat beside the hobbits.\n\n'Well, well! The hunt is over, and we meet again at last, where none of us ever thought to come,' said Aragorn.\n\n'And now that the great ones have gone to discuss high matters,' said Legolas, 'the hunters can perhaps learn the answers to their own small riddles. We tracked you as far as the forest, but there are still many things that I should like to know the truth of.'\n\n'And there is a great deal, too, that we want to know about you,' said Merry. 'We have learnt a few things through Treebeard, the Old Ent, but that is not nearly enough.'\n\n'All in good time,' said Legolas. 'We were the hunters, and you should give an account of yourselves to us first.'\n\n'Or second,' said Gimli. 'It would go better after a meal.\u2020I have a sore head; and it is past mid-day. You truants might make amends by finding us some of the plunder that you spoke of. Food and drink would pay off some of my score against you.'\n\n'Then you shall have it,' said Pippin. 'Will you have it here, or in more comfort in what's left of Saruman's guard-house \u0426 over there under the arch? We had to picnic out here, so as to keep an eye on the road.'\n\n'Less than an eye!' said Gimli. 'But I will not go into any orc-house nor touch Orcs' meat or anything that they have mauled.'\n\n'We wouldn't ask you to,' said Merry. 'We have had enough of Orcs ourselves to last a life-time. But there were many other folk in Isengard. Saruman kept enough wisdom not to trust his Orcs. He had Men to guard his gates: some of his most faithful servants, I suppose. Anyway they were favoured and got good provisions.'\n\n'And pipe-weed?' asked Gimli.\n\n'No, I don't think so,' Merry laughed. 'But that is another story, which can wait until after lunch.'\n\n'Well let us go and have lunch then!' said the Dwarf.\n\nThe hobbits led the way; and they passed under the arch and came to a wide door upon the left, at the top of a stair. It opened direct into a large chamber, with other smaller doors at the far end, and a hearth and chimney at one side. The chamber was hewn out of the stone; and it must once have been dark, for its windows looked out only into the tunnel. But light came in now through the broken roof. On the hearth wood was burning.\n\n'I lit a bit of fire,' said Pippin. 'It cheered us up in the fogs. There were few faggots about, and most of the wood we could find was wet. But there is a great draught in the chimney: it seems to wind away up through the rock, and fortunately it has not been blocked. A fire is handy. I will make you some toast. The bread is three or four days old, I am afraid.'\n\nAragorn and his companions sat themselves down at one end of a long table, and the hobbits disappeared through one of the inner doors. 'Store-room in there, and above the woods, luckily,' said Pippin, as they came back laden with dishes, bowls, cups, knives, and food of various sorts.\n\n'And you need not turn up your nose at the provender, Master Gimli,' said Merry. 'This is not orc-stuff, but man-food, as Treebeard calls it. Will you have wine or beer? There's a barrel inside there \u0426 very passable. And this is first-rate salted pork. Or I can cut you some rashers of bacon and broil them, if you like. I am sorry there is no green stuff: the deliveries have been rather interrupted in the last few days! I cannot offer you anything to follow but butter and honey for your bread. Are you content?'\n\n'Indeed yes,' said Gimli. 'The score is much reduced.'\n\nThe three were soon busy with their meal; and the two hobbits, unabashed, set to a second time. 'We must keep our guests company,' they said.\n\n'You are full of courtesy this morning,' laughed Legolas. 'But maybe, if we had not arrived, you would already have been keeping one another company again.'\n\n'Maybe; and why not?' said Pippin. 'We had foul fare with the Orcs, and little enough for days before that. It seems a long while since we could eat to heart's content.'\n\n'It does not seem to have done you any harm,' said Aragorn. 'Indeed you look in the bloom of health.'\n\n'Aye, you do indeed,' said Gimli, looking them up and down over the top of his cup. 'Why, your hair is twice as thick and curly as when we parted; and I would swear that you have both grown somewhat, if that is possible for hobbits of your age. This Treebeard at any rate has not starved you.'\n\n'He has not,' said Merry. 'But Ents only drink, and drink is not enough for content. Treebeard's draughts may be nourishing, but one feels the need of something solid. And even lembas is none the worse for a change.'\n\n'You have drunk of the waters of the Ents, have you?' said Legolas. 'Ah, then I think it is likely that Gimli's eyes do not deceive him. Strange songs have been sung of the draughts of Fangorn.'\n\n'Many strange tales have been told about that land,' said Aragorn. 'I have never entered it. Come, tell me more about it, and about the Ents!'\n\n'Ents,' said Pippin, 'Ents are \u0426 well Ents are all different for on thing. But their eyes now, their eyes are very odd.' He tried a few fumbling words that trailed off into silence. 'Oh, well,' he went on, 'you have seen some at a distance, already-they saw you at any rate, and reported that you were on the way-and you will see many others, I expect, before you leave here. You must form your own ideas.'\n\n'Now, now!' said Gimli. 'We are beginning the story in the middle. I should like a tale in the right order, starting with that strange day when our fellowship was broken.'\n\n'You shall have it, if there is time,' said Merry. 'But first \u0426 if you have finished eating \u0426 you shall fill your pipes and light up. And then for a little while we can pretend that we are all back safe at Bree again, or in Rivendell.'\n\nHe produced a small leather bag full of tobacco. 'We have heaps of it,' he said, 'and you can all pack as much as you wish, when we go. We did some salvage-work this morning, Pippin and I. There are lots of things floating about. It was Pippin who found two small barrels, washed up out of some cellar or store-house, I suppose. When we opened them, we found they were filled with this: as fine a pipe-weed as you could wish for, and quite unspoilt.'\n\nGimli took some and rubbed it in his palms and sniffed it. 'It feels good, and it smells good,' he said.\n\n'It is good!' said Merry. 'My dear Gimli, it is Longbottom Leaf! There were the Hornblower brandmarks on the barrels, as plain as plain. How it came here, I can't imagine. For Saruman's private use, I fancy. I never knew that it went so far abroad. But it comes in handy now?'\n\n'It would,' said Gimli, 'if I had a pipe to go with it. Alas, I lost mine in Moria, or before. Is there no pipe in all your plunder?'\n\n'No, I am afraid not,' said Merry. 'We have not found any, not even here in the guardrooms. Saruman kept this dainty to himself, it seems. And I don't think it would be any use knocking on the doors of Orthanc to beg a pipe of him! We shall have to share pipes, as good friends must at a pinch.'\n\n'Half a moment!' said Pippin. Putting his hand inside the breast of his jacket he pulled out a little soft wallet on a string. 'I keep a treasure or two near my skin, as precious as Rings to me. Here's one: my old wooden pipe. And here's another: an unused one. I have carried it a long way, though I don't know why. I never really expected to find any pipe-weed on the journey, when my own ran out. But now it comes in useful after all.' He held up a small pipe with a wide flattened bowl, and handed it to Gimli. 'Does that settle the score between us?' he said. 'Settle it!' cried Gimli. 'Most noble hobbit, it leaves me deep in your debt.'\n\n'Well, I am going back into the open air, to see what the wind and sky are doing!' said Legolas.\n\n'We will come with you,' said Aragorn.\n\nThey went out and seated themselves upon the piled stones before the gateway. They could see far down into the valley now; the mists were lifting and floating away upon the breeze.\n\n'Now let us take our ease here for a little!' said Aragorn. 'We will sit on the edge of ruin and talk, as Gandalf says, while he is busy elsewhere. I feel a weariness such as I have seldom felt before.' He wrapped his grey cloak about him, hiding his mail-shirt, and stretched out his long legs. Then he lay back and sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke.\n\n'Look!' said Pippin. 'Strider the Ranger has come back!'\n\n'He has never been away,' said Aragorn. 'I am Strider and Dunadan too, and I belong both to Gondor and the North.'\n\nThey smoked in silence for a while, and the sun shone on them; slanting into the valley from among white clouds high in the West. Legolas lay still, looking up at the sun and sky with steady eyes, and singing softly to himself. At last he sat up. 'Come now!' he said. 'Time wears on, and the mists are blowing away, or would if you strange folk did not wreathe yourselves in smoke. What of the tale?'\n\n'Well, my tale begins with waking up in the dark and finding myself all strung-up in an orc-camp,' said Pippin. 'Let me see, what is today?'\n\n'The fifth of March in the Shire-reckoning,' said Aragorn.\n\nPippin made some calculations on his fingers. 'Only nine days ago!' he said.[2 - Every month in the Shire-calendar had 30 days.]\u2020'It seems a year since we were caught. Well, though half of it was like a bad dream, I reckon that three very horrible days followed. Merry will correct me, if I forget anything important: I am not going into details: the whips and the filth and stench and all that; it does not bear remembering.' With that he plunged into an account of Boromir's last fight and the orc-march from Emyn Muil to the Forest. The others nodded as the various points were fitted in with their guesses.\n\n'Here are some treasures that you let fall,' said Aragorn. 'You will be glad to have them back.' He loosened his belt from under his cloak and took from it the two sheathed knives.\n\n'Well!' said Merry. 'I never expected to see those again! I marked a few orcs with mine; but Ugluk took them from us. How he glared! At first I thought he was going to stab me, but he threw the things away as if they burned him.'\n\n'And here also is your brooch, Pippin,' said Aragorn. 'I have kept it safe, for it is a very precious thing.'\n\n'I know,' said Pippin. 'It was a wrench to let it go; but what else could I do?'\n\n'Nothing else,' answered Aragorn. 'One who cannot cast away a treasure at need is in fetters. You did rightly.'\n\n'The cutting of the bands on your wrists, that was smart work!' said Gimli. 'Luck served you there; but you seized your chance with both hands, one might say.'\n\n'And set us a pretty riddle,' said Legolas. 'I wondered if you had grown wings!'\n\n'Unfortunately not,' said Pippin. 'But you did not know about Grishnakh.' He shuddered and said no more, leaving Merry to tell of those last horrible moments: the pawing hands, the hot breath, and the dreadful strength of Grishnakh's hairy arms.\n\n'All this about the Orcs of Barad-dur, Lugburz as they call it, makes me uneasy,' said Aragorn. 'The Dark Lord already knew too much and his servants also; and Grishnakh evidently sent some message across the River after the quarrel. The Red Eye will be looking towards Isengard. But Saruman at any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting.'\n\n'Yes, whichever side wins, his outlook is poor,' said Merry. 'Things began to go all wrong for him from the moment his Orcs set foot in Rohan.'\n\n'We caught a glimpse of the old villain, or so Gandalf hints,' said Gimli. 'On the edge of the Forest.'\n\n'When was that?' asked Pippin.\n\n'Five nights ago,' said Aragorn.\n\n'Let me see,' said Merry, 'five nights ago \u0426 now we come to a part of the story you know nothing about. We met Treebeard that morning after the battle; and that night we were at Wellinghall, one of his ent-houses. The next morning we went to Entmoot, a gathering of Ents, that is, and the queerest thing I have ever seen in my life. It lasted all that day and the next; and we spent the nights with an Ent called Quickbeam. And then late in the afternoon in the third day of their moot, the Ents suddenly blew up. It was amazing. The Forest had felt as tense as if a thunderstorm was brewing inside it: then all at once it exploded. I wish you could have heard their song as they marched.'\n\n'If Saruman had heard it, he would be a hundred miles away by now, even if he had had to run on his own legs,' said Pippin.\n\n\t\t'Though Isengard be strong and hard, as cold as stone and bare as bone,\n\t\tWe go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door!\n\nThere was very much more. A great deal of the song had no words, and was like a music of horns and drums. It was very exciting. But I thought it was only marching music and no more, just a song \u0426 until I got here. I know better now.'\n\n'We came down over the last ridge into Nan Curunir, after night had fallen,' Merry continued. 'It was then that I first had the feeling that the Forest itself was moving behind us. I thought I was dreaming an entish dream, but Pippin had noticed it too. We were both frightened; but we did not find out more about it until later.\n\n'It was the Huorns, or so the Ents call them in \"short language\". Treebeard won't say much about them, but I think they are Ents that have become almost like trees, at least to look at. They stand here and there in the wood or under its eaves, silent, watching endlessly over the trees; but deep in the darkest dales there are hundreds and hundreds of them, I believe.\n\n'There is a great power in them, and they seem able to wrap themselves in shadow: it is difficult to see them moving. But they do. They can move very quickly, if they are angry. You stand still looking at the weather, maybe, or listening to the rustling of the wind, and then suddenly you find that you are in the middle of a wood with great groping trees all around you. They still have voices, and can speak with the Ents \u0426 that is why they are called Huorns, Treebeard says \u0426 but they have become queer and wild. Dangerous. I should be terrified of meeting them, if there were no true Ents about to look after them.\n\n'Well, in the early night we crept down a long ravine into the upper end of the Wizard's Vale, the Ents with all their rustling Huorns behind. We could not see them, of course, but the whole air was full of creaking. It was very dark, a cloudy night. They moved at a great speed as soon as they had left the hills, and made a noise like a rushing wind. The Moon did not appear through the clouds, and not long after midnight there was a tall wood all round the north side of Isengard. There was no sign of enemies nor of any challenge. There was a light gleaming from a high window in the tower, that was all.\n\n'Treebeard and a few more Ents crept on, right round to within sight of the great gates. Pippin and I were with him. We were sitting on Treebeard's shoulders, and I could feel the quivering tenseness in him. But even when they are roused, Ents can be very cautious and patient. They stood still as carved stones, breathing and listening.\n\n'Then all at once there was a tremendous stir. Trumpets blared and the walls of Isengard echoed. We thought that we had been discovered, and that battle was going to begin. But nothing of the sort. All Saruman's people were marching away. I don't know much about this war, or about the Horsemen of Rohan, but Saruman seems to have meant to finish off the king and all his men with one final blow. He emptied Isengard. I saw the enemy go: endless lines of marching Orcs; and troops of them mounted on great wolves. And there were battalions of Men, too. Many of them carried torches, and in the flare I could see their faces. Most of them were ordinary men, rather tall and dark-haired, and grim but not particularly evil-looking. But there were some others that were horrible: man-high, but with goblin-faces, sallow, leering, squint-eyed. Do you know, they reminded me at once of that Southerner at Bree: only he was not so obviously orc-like as most of these were.'\n\n'I thought of him too,' said Aragorn. 'We had many of these half-orcs to deal with at Helm's Deep. It seems plain now that that Southerner was a spy of Saruman's; but whether he was working with the Black Riders, or for Saruman alone, I do not know. It is difficult with these evil folk to know when they are in league, and when they are cheating one another.'\n\n'Well, of all sorts together, there must have been ten thousand at the very least,' said Merry. 'They took an hour to pass out of the gates. Some went off down the highway to the Fords, and some turned away\u2020and went eastward. A bridge has been built down there, about a mile away, where the river runs in a very deep channel. You could see it now, if you stood up. They were all singing with harsh voices, and laughing, making a hideous din. I thought things looked very black for Rohan. But Treebeard did not move. He said: 'My business is with Isengard tonight, with rock and stone.'\n\n'But, though I could not see what was happening in the dark, I believe that Huorns began to move south, as soon as the gates were shut again. Their business was with Orcs I think. They were far down the valley in the morning; or any rate there was a shadow there that one couldn't see through.\n\n'As soon as Saruman had sent off all his army, our turn came. Treebeard put us down, and went up to the gates, and began hammering on the doors, and calling for Saruman. There was no answer, except arrows and stones from the walls. But arrows are no use against Ents. They hurt them, of course, and infuriate them: like stinging flies. But an Ent can be stuck as full of orc-arrows as a pin-cushion, and take no serious harm. They cannot be poisoned, for one thing; and their skin seems to be very thick, and tougher than bark. It takes a very heavy axe-stroke to wound them seriously. They don't like axes. But there would have to be a great many axe-men to one Ent: a man that hacks once at an Ent never gets a chance of a second blow. A punch from an Ent-fist crumples up iron like thin tin.\n\n'When Treebeard had got a few arrows in him, he began to warm up, to get positively \"hasty\", as he would say. He let out a great hoom-hom, and a dozen more Ents came striding up. An angry Ent is terrifying. Their fingers, and their toes, just freeze on to rock; and they tear it up like bread-crust. It was like watching the work of great tree-roots in a hundred years, all packed into a few moments.\n\n'They pushed, pulled, tore, shook, and hammered; and clang-bang, crash-crack, in five minutes they had these huge gates just lying in ruin; and some were already beginning to eat into the walls, like rabbits in a sand-pit. I don't know what Saruman thought was happening; but anyway he did not know how to deal with it. His wizardry may have been falling off lately, of course; but anyway I think he has not much grit, not much plain courage alone in a tight place without a lot of slaves and machines and things, if you know what I mean. Very different from old Gandalf. I wonder if his fame was not all along mainly due to his cleverness in settling at Isengard.'\n\n'No,' said Aragorn. 'Once he was as great as his fame made him. His knowledge was deep, his thought was subtle, and his hands marvellously skilled; and he had a power over the minds of others. The wise he could persuade, and the smaller folk he could daunt. That power he certainly still keeps. There are not many in Middle-earth that I should say were safe, if they were left alone to talk with him, even now when he has suffered a defeat. Gandalf, Elrond, and Galadriel, perhaps, now that his wickedness has been laid bare, but very few others.'\n\n'The Ents are safe,' said Pippin. 'He seems at one time to have got round them, but never again. And anyway he did not understand them; and he made the great mistake of leaving them out of his calculations. He had no plan for them, and there was no time to make any, once they had set to work. As soon as our attack began, the few remaining rats in Isengard started bolting through every hole that the Ents made. The Ents let the Men go, after they had questioned them, two or three dozen only down at this end. I don't think many orc-folk, of any size, escaped. Not from the Huorns: there was a wood full of them all round Isengard by that time, as well as those that had gone down the valley.\n\n'When the Ents had reduced a large part of the southern walls to rubbish, and what was left of his people had bolted and deserted him, Saruman fled in a panic. He seems to have been at the gates when we arrived: I expect he came to watch his splendid army march out. When the Ents broke their way in, he left in a hurry. They did not spot him at first. But the night had opened out, and there was a great light of stars, quite enough for Ents to see by, and suddenly Quickbeam gave a cry \"The tree-killer, the tree-killer!\" Quickbeam is a gentle creature, but he hates Saruman all the more fiercely for that: his people suffered cruelly from orc-axes. He leapt down the path from the inner gate, and he can move like a wind when he is roused. There was a pale figure hurrying away in and out of the shadows of the pillars, and it had nearly reached the stairs to the tower-door. But it was a near thing. Quickbeam was so hot after him, that he was within a step or two of being caught and strangled when he slipped in through the door.\n\n'When Saruman was safe back in Orthanc, it was not long before he set some of his precious machinery to work. By that time there were many Ents inside Isengard: some had followed Quickbeam, and others had burst in from the north and east; they were roaming about and doing a great deal of damage. Suddenly up came fires and foul fumes: the vents and shafts all over the plain began to spout and belch. Several of the Ents got scorched and blistered. One of them, Beechbone I think he was called, a very tall handsome Ent, got caught in a spray of some liquid fire and burned like a torch: a horrible sight.\n\n'That sent them mad. I thought that they had been really roused before; but I was wrong. I saw what it was like at last. It was staggering. They roared and boomed and trumpeted, until stones began to crack and fall at the mere noise of them. Merry and I lay on the ground and stuffed our cloaks into our ears. Round and round the rock of Orthanc the Ents went striding and storming like a howling gale, breaking pillars, hurling avalanches of boulders down the shafts, tossing up huge slabs of stone into the air like leaves. The tower was in the middle of a spinning whirlwind. I saw iron posts and blocks of masonry go rocketing up hundreds of feet, and smash against the windows of Orthanc. But Treebeard kept his head. He had not had any burns, luckily. He did not want his folk to hurt themselves in their fury, and he did not want Saruman to escape out of some hole in the confusion. Many of the Ents were hurling themselves against the Orthanc-rock; but that defeated them. It is very smooth and hard. Some wizardry is in it, perhaps, older and stronger than Saruman's. Anyway they could not get a grip on it, or make a crack in it; and they were bruising and wounding themselves against it. 'So Treebeard went out into the ring and shouted. His enormous voice rose above all the din. There was a dead silence, suddenly. In it we heard a shrill laugh from a high window in the tower. That had a queer effect on the Ents. They had been boiling over; now they became cold, grim as ice, and quiet. They left the plain and gathered round Treebeard, standing quite still. He spoke to them for a little in their own language; I think he was telling them of a plan he had made in his old head long before. Then they just faded silently away in the grey light. Day was dawning by that time.\n\n'They set a watch on the tower, I believe, but the watchers were so well hidden in shadows and kept so still, that I could not see them. The others went away north. All that day they were busy, out of sight. Most of the time we were left alone. It was a dreary day; and we wandered about a bit, though we kept out of the view of the windows of Orthanc, as much as we could: they stared at us so threateningly. A good deal of the time we spent looking for something to eat. And also we sat and talked, wondering what was happening away south in Rohan, and what had become of all the rest of our Company. Every now and then we could hear in the distance the rattle and fall of stone, and thudding noises echoing in the hills.\n\n'In the afternoon we walked round the circle, and went to have a look at what was going on. There was a great shadowy wood of Huorns at the head of the valley, and another round the northern wall. We did not dare to go in. But there was a rending, tearing noise of work going on inside. Ents and Huorns were digging great pits and trenches, and making great pools and dams, gathering all the waters of the Isen and every other spring and stream that they could find. We left them to it.\n\n'At dusk Treebeard came back to the gate. He was humming and booming to himself, and seemed pleased. He stood and stretched his great arms and legs and breathed deep. I asked him if he was tired.\n\n'\"Tired?\" he said, \"tired? Well no, not tired, but stiff. I need a good draught of Entwash. We have worked hard; we have done more stone-cracking and earth-gnawing today than we have done in many a long year before. But it is nearly finished. When night falls do not linger near this gate or in the old tunnel! Water may come through \u0426 and it will be foul water for a while, until all the filth of Saruman is washed away. Then Isen can run clean again.\" He began to pull down a bit more of the walls, in a leisurely sort of way, just to amuse himself.\n\n'We were just wondering where it would be safe to lie and get some sleep, when the most amazing thing of all happened. There was the sound of a rider coming swiftly up the road. Merry and I lay quiet, and Treebeard hid himself in the shadows under the arch. Suddenly a great horse came striding up, like a flash of silver. It was already dark. but I could see the rider's face clearly: it seemed to shine, and all his clothes were white. I just sat up, staring, with my mouth open. I tried to call out, and couldn't.\n\n'There was no need. He halted just by us and looked down at us. 'Gandalf!' I said at last. but my voice was only a whisper. Did he say: \"Hullo, Pippin! This is a pleasant surprise!\"? No, indeed! He said: \"Get up, you tom-fool of a Took! Where, in the name of wonder, in all this ruin is Treebeard? I want him. Quick!\"\n\n'Treebeard heard his voice and came out of the shadows at once; and there was a strange meeting. I was surprised, because neither of them seemed surprised at all. Gandalf obviously expected to find Treebeard here; and Treebeard might almost have been loitering about near the gates on purpose to meet him. Yet we had told the old Ent all about Moria. But then I remembered a queer look he gave us at the time. I can only suppose that he had seen Gandalf or had some news of him, but would not say anything in a hurry. \"Don't be hasty\" is his motto; but nobody, not even Elves, will say much about Gandalf's movements when he is not there.\n\n'\"Hoom! Gandalf!\" said Treebeard. \"I am glad you have come. Wood and water, stock and stone, I can master; but there is a Wizard to manage here.\"\n\n'\"Treebeard,\" said Gandalf. \"I need your help. You have done much, but I need more. I have about ten thousand Orcs to manage.\"\n\n'Then those two went off and had a council together in some corner. It must have seemed very hasty to Treebeard, for Gandalf was in a tremendous hurry, and was already talking at a great pace, before they passed out of hearing. They were only away a matter of minutes, perhaps a quarter of an hour. Then Gandalf came back to us, and he seemed relieved, almost merry. He did say he was glad to see us, then.\n\n'\"But Gandalf,\" I cried, \"where have you been? And have you seen the others?\"\n\n'\"Wherever I have been, I am back,\" he answered in the genuine Gandalf manner. \"Yes, I have seen some of the others. But news must wait. This is a perilous night, and I must ride fast. But the dawn may be brighter; and if so, we shall meet again. Take care of yourselves, and keep away from Orthanc! Good-bye!\"\n\n'Treebeard was very thoughtful after Gandalf had gone. He had evidently learnt a lot in a short time and was digesting it. He looked at us and said: \"Hm, well, I find you are not such hasty folk as I thought. You said much less than you might, and not more than you should. Hm, this is a bundle of news and no mistake! Well, now Treebeard must get busy again.\"\n\n'Before he went, we got a little news out of him; and it did not cheer us up at all. But for the moment we thought more about you three than about Frodo and Sam, or about poor Boromir. For we gathered that there was a great battle going on, or soon would be, and that you were in it, and might never come out of it.\n\n'\"Huorns will help,\" said Treebeard. Then he went away and we did not see him again until this morning.\n\n'It was deep night. We lay on top of a pile of stone, and could see nothing beyond it. Mist or shadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all round us. The air seemed hot and heavy; and it was full of rustlings, creakings, and a murmur like voices passing. I think that hundreds more of the Huorns must have been passing by to help in the battle. Later there was a great rumble of thunder away south, and flashes of lightning far away across Rohan. Every now and then we could see mountain-peaks, miles and miles away, stab out suddenly, black and white, and then vanish. And behind us there were noises like thunder in hills, but different. At times the whole valley echoed.\n\n'It must have been about midnight when the Ents broke the dams and poured all the gathered waters through a gap in the northern wall, down into Isengard. The Huorn-dark had passed, and the thunder had rolled away. The Moon was sinking behind the western mountains.\n\n'Isengard began to fill up with black creeping streams and pools. They glittered in the last light of the Moon, as they spread over the plain. Every now and then the waters found their way down into some shaft or spouthole. Great white steams hissed up. Smoke rose in billows. There were explosions and gusts of fire. One great coil of vapour went whirling up, twisting round and round Orthanc, until it looked like a tall peak of cloud, fiery underneath and moonlit above. And still more water poured in, until at last Isengard looked like a huge flat saucepan, all steaming and bubbling.'\n\n'We saw a cloud of smoke and steam from the south last night when we came to the mouth of Nan Curunir,' said Aragorn. 'We feared that Saruman was brewing some new devilry for us.'\n\n'Not he!' said Pippin. 'He was probably choking and not laughing any more. By the morning, yesterday morning, the water had sunk down into all the holes, and there was a dense fog. We took refuge in that guardroom over there; and we had rather a fright. The lake began to overflow and pour out through the old tunnel, and the water was rapidly rising up the steps. We thought we were going to get caught like Orcs in a hole; but we found a winding stair at the back of the store-room that brought us out on top of the arch. It was a squeeze to get out, as the passages had been cracked and half blocked with fallen stone near the top. There we sat high up above the floods and watched the drowning of Isengard. The Ents kept on pouring in more water, till all the fires were quenched and every cave filled. The fogs slowly gathered together and steamed up into a huge umbrella of cloud: it must have been a mile high. In the evening there was a great rainbow over the eastern hills; and then the sunset was blotted out by a thick drizzle on the mountain-sides. It all went very quiet. A few wolves howled mournfully, far away. The Ents stopped the inflow in the night, and sent the Isen back into its old course. And that was the end of it all.\n\n'Since then the water has been sinking again. There must be outlets somewhere from the caves underneath, I think. If Saruman peeps out of any of his windows, it must look an untidy, dreary mess. We felt very lonely. Not even a visible Ent to talk to in all the ruin; and no news. We spent the night up on top there above the arch, and it was cold and damp and we did not sleep. We had a feeling that anything might happen at any minute. Saruman is still in his tower. There was a noise in the night like a wind coming up the valley. I think the Ents and Huorns that had been away came back then; but where they have all gone to now, I don't know. It was a misty, moisty morning when we climbed down and looked round again, and nobody was about. And that is about all there is to tell. It seems almost peaceful now after all the turmoil. And safer too, somehow, since Gandalf came back. I could sleep!'\n\nThey all fell silent for a while. Gimli re-filled his pipe. 'There is one thing I wonder about,' he said as he lit it with his flint and tinder: 'Wormtongue. You told Theoden he was with Saruman. How did he get there?'\n\n'Oh yes, I forgot about him,' said Pippin. 'He did not get here till this morning. We had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when Treebeard appeared again. We heard him hooming and calling our names outside.\n\n'\"I have just come round to see how you are faring, my lads,' he said, 'and to give you some news. Huorns have come back. All's well; aye very well indeed!\" he laughed, and slapped his thighs. \"No more Orcs in Isengard, no more axes! And there will be folk coming up from the South before the day is old; some that you may be glad to see.\"\n\n'He had hardly said that, when we heard the sound of hoofs on the road. We rushed out before the gates, and I stood and stared, half expecting to see Strider and Gandalf come riding up at the head of an army. But out of the mist there rode a man on an old tired horse; and he looked a queer twisted sort of creature himself. There was no one else. When he came out of the mist and suddenly saw all the ruin and wreckage in front of him, he sat and gaped, and his face went almost green. He was so bewildered that he did not seem to notice us at first. When he did, he gave a cry, and tried to turn his horse round and ride off. But Treebeard took three strides, put out a long arm, and lifted him out of the saddle. His horse bolted in terror, and he grovelled on the ground. He said he was Grima, friend and counsellor of the king, and had been sent with important messages from Theoden to Saruman.\n\n'\"No one else would dare to ride through the open land, so full of foul Orcs,\" he said, \"so I was sent. And I have had a perilous journey, and I am hungry and weary. I fled far north out of my way, pursued by wolves.\"\n\n'I caught the sidelong looks he gave to Treebeard, and I said to myself \"liar\". Treebeard looked at him in his long slow way for several minutes, till the wretched man was squirming on the floor. Then at last he said: \"Ha, hm, I was expecting you, Master Wormtongue.\" The man started at that name. \"Gandalf got here first. So I know as much about you as I need, and I know what to do with you. Put all the rats in one trap, said Gandalf; and I will. I am the master of Isengard now, but Saruman is locked in his tower; and you can go there and give him all the messages that you can think of.\"\n\n'\"Let me go, let me go!\" said Wormtongue. \"I know the way.\"\n\n'\"You knew the way, I don't doubt,\" said Treebeard. \"But things have changed here a little. Go and see!\"\n\n'He let Wormtongue go, and he limped off through the arch with us close behind, until he came inside the ring and could see all the floods that lay between him and Orthanc. Then he turned to us.\n\n'\"Let me go away!\" he whined. \"Let me go away! My messages are useless now.\"\n\n'\"They are indeed,\" said Treebeard. \"But you have only two choices: to stay with me until Gandalf and your master arrive; or to cross the water. Which will you have?\"\n\n'The man shivered at the mention of his master, and put a foot into the water; but he drew back. \"I cannot swim,\" he said.\n\n'\"The water is not deep,\" said Treebeard. \"It is dirty, but that will not harm you, Master Wormtongue. In you go now!\"\n\n'With that the wretch floundered off into the flood. It rose up nearly to his neck before he got too far away for me to see him. The last I saw of him was clinging to some old barrel or piece of wood. But Treebeard waded after him, and watched his progress.\n\n'\"Well, he has gone in,\" he said when he returned. \"I saw him crawling up the steps like a draggled rat. There is someone in the tower still: a hand came out and pulled him in. So there he is, and I hope the welcome is to his liking. Now I must go and wash myself clean of the slime. I'll be away up on the north side, if anyone wants to see me. There is no clean water down here fit for an Ent to drink or to bathe in. So I will ask you two lads to keep a watch at the gate for the folk that are coming. There'll be the Lord of the Fields of Rohan, mark you! You must welcome him as well as you know how: his men have fought a great fight with the Orcs. Maybe, you know the right fashion of Men's words for such a lord, better than Ents. There have been many lords in the green fields in my time, and I have never learned their speech or their names. They will be wanting man-food, and you know all about that, I guess. So find what you think is fit for a king to eat, if you can.\" And that is the end of the story. Though I should like to know who this Wormtongue is. Was he really the king's counsellor?'\n\n'He was,' said Aragorn; 'and also Saruman's spy and servant in Rohan. Fate has not been kinder to him than he deserves. The sight of the ruin of all that he thought so strong and magnificent must have been almost punishment enough. But I fear that worse awaits him.'\n\n'Yes, I don't suppose Treebeard sent him to Orthanc out of kindness,' said Merry. 'He seemed rather grimly delighted with the business and was laughing to himself when he went to get his bathe and drink. We spent a busy time after that, searching the flotsam, and rummaging about. We found two or three store-rooms in different places nearby, above the flood-level. But Treebeard sent some Ents down, and they carried off a great deal of the stuff.\n\n'\"We want man-food for twenty-five,\" the Ents said, so you can see that somebody had counted your company carefully before you arrived. You three were evidently meant to go with the great people. But you would not have fared any better. We kept as good as we sent, I promise you. Better, because we sent no drink.\n\n'\"What about drink?\" I said to the Ents.\n\n'\"There is water of Isen,\" they said, \"and that is good enough for Ents and Men.\" But I hope that the Ents may have found time to brew some of their draughts from the mountain-springs, and we shall see Gandalf's beard curling when he returns. After the Ents had gone, we felt tired, and hungry. But we did not grumble \u0426 our labours had been well rewarded. It was through our search for man-food that Pippin discovered the prize of all the flotsam, those Hornblower barrels. \"Pipe-weed is better after food,\" said Pippin; that is how the situation arose.'\n\n'We understand it all perfectly now,' said Gimli.\n\n'All except one thing,' said Aragorn, 'leaf from the Southfarthing in Isengard. The more I consider it, the more curious I find it. I have never been in Isengard, but I have journeyed in this land, and I know well the empty countries that lie between Rohan and the Shire. Neither goods nor folk have passed that way for many a long year, not openly. Saruman had secret dealings with someone in the Shire, I guess. Wormtongues may be found in other houses than King Theoden's. Was there a date on the barrels?'\n\n'Yes,' said Pippin. 'It was the 1417 crop, that is last year's; no, the year before, of course, now: a good year.'\n\n'Ah well, whatever evil was afoot is over now, I hope; or else it is beyond our reach at present,' said Aragorn. 'Yet I think I shall mention it to Gandalf, small matter though it may seem among his great affairs.'\n\n'I wonder what he is doing,' said Merry. 'The afternoon is getting on. Let us go and look round! You can enter Isengard now at any rate, Strider, if you want to. But it is not a very cheerful sight.'\n\n\n\nChapter 10\n\nThe Voice of Saruman\n\nThey passed through the ruined tunnel and stood upon a heap of stones, gazing at the dark rock of Orthanc, and its many windows, a menace still in the desolation that lay all about it. The waters had now nearly all subsided. Here and there gloomy pools remained, covered with scum and wreckage; but most of the wide circle was bare again, a wilderness of slime and tumbled rock, pitted with blackened holes, and dotted with posts and pillars leaning drunkenly this way and that. At the rim of the shattered bowl there lay vast mounds and slopes, like the shingles cast up by a great storm; and beyond them the green and tangled valley ran up into the long ravine between the dark arms of the mountains. Across the waste they saw riders picking their way; they were coming from the north side, and already they were drawing near to Orthanc.\n\n'There is Gandalf, and Theoden and his men!' said Legolas. 'Let us go and meet them!'\n\n'Walk warily!' said Merry. 'There are loose slabs that may tilt up and throw you down into a pit, if you don't take care.'\n\nThey followed what was left of the road from the gates to Orthanc, going slowly, for the flag-stones were cracked and slimed. The riders, seeing them approach, halted under the shadow of the rock and waited for them. Gandalf rode forward to meet them.\n\n'Well, Treebeard and I have had some interesting discussions, and made a few plans,' he said, 'and we have all had some much-needed rest. Now we must be going on again. I hope you companions have all rested, too, and refreshed yourselves?'\n\n'We have,' said Merry. 'But our discussions began and ended in smoke. Still we feel less ill-disposed towards Saruman than we did.'\n\n'Do you indeed?' said Gandalf. 'Well, I do not. I have now a last task to do before I go: I must pay Saruman a farewell visit. Dangerous, and probably useless; but it must be done. Those of you who wish may come with me \u0426 but beware! And do not jest! This is not the time for it.'\n\n'I will come,' said Gimli. 'I wish to see him and learn if he really looks like you.'\n\n'And how will you learn that, Master Dwarf?' said Gandalf. 'Saruman could look like me in your eyes, if it suited his purpose with you. And are you yet wise enough to detect all his counterfeits? Well, we shall see, perhaps. He may be shy of showing himself before many different eyes together. But I have ordered all the Ents to remove themselves from sight, so perhaps we shall persuade him to come out.'\n\n'What's the danger?' asked Pippin. 'Will he shoot at us, and pour fire out of the windows; or can he put a spell on us from a distance?'\n\n'The last is most likely, if you ride to his door with a light heart,' said Gandalf. 'But there is no knowing what he can do, or may choose to try. A wild beast cornered is not safe to approach. And Saruman has powers you do not guess. Beware of his voice!'\n\nThey came now to the foot of Orthanc. It was black, and the rock gleamed as if it were wet. The many faces of the stone had sharp edges as though they had been newly chiselled. A few scorings, and small flake-like splinters near the base, were all the marks that it bore of the fury of the Ents.\n\nOn the eastern side, in the angle of two piers, there was a great door, high above the ground; and over it was a shuttered window, opening upon a balcony hedged with iron bars. Up to the threshold of the door there mounted a flight of twenty-seven broad stairs, hewn by some unknown art of the same black stone. This was the only entrance to the tower; but many tall windows were cut with deep embrasures in the climbing walls: far up they peered like little eyes in the sheer faces of the horns.\n\nAt the foot of the stairs Gandalf and the king dismounted. 'I will go up,' said Gandalf. 'I have been in Orthanc and I know my peril.'\n\n'And I too will go up,' said the king. 'I am old, and fear no peril any more. I wish to speak with the enemy who has done me so much wrong. Eomer shall come with me, and see that my aged feet do not falter.'\n\n'As you will,' said Gandalf. 'Aragorn shall come with me. Let the others await us at the foot of the stairs. They will hear and see enough, if there is anything to hear or see.'\n\n'Nay!' said Gimli. 'Legolas and I wish for a closer view. We alone here represent our kindred. We also will come behind.'\n\n'Come then!' said Gandalf, and with that he climbed the steps, and Theoden went beside him.\n\nThe Riders of Rohan sat uneasily upon their horses, on either side of the stair, and looked up darkly at the great tower, fearing what might befall their lord. Merry and Pippin sat on the bottom step, feeling both unimportant and unsafe.\n\n'Half a sticky mile from here to the gate!' muttered Pippin. 'I wish I could slip off back to the guardroom unnoticed! What did we come for? We are not wanted.'\n\nGandalf stood before the door of Orthanc and beat on it with his staff. It rang with a hollow sound. 'Saruman, Saruman!' he cried in a loud commanding voice. 'Saruman come forth!'\n\nFor some time there was no answer. At last the window above the door was unbarred, but no figure could be seen at its dark opening.\n\n'Who is it?' said a voice. 'What do you wish?'\n\nTheoden started. 'I know that voice,' he said, 'and I curse the day when I first listened to it.'\n\n'Go and fetch Saruman, since you have become his footman, Grima Wormtongue!' said Gandalf. 'And do not waste our time!'\n\nThe window closed. They waited. Suddenly another voice spoke, low and melodious, its very sound an enchantment. Those who listened unwarily to that voice could seldom report the words that they heard; and if they did, they wondered, for little power remained in them. Mostly they remembered only that it was a delight to hear the voice speaking, all that it said seemed wise and reasonable, and desire awoke in them by swift agreement to seem wise themselves. When others spoke they seemed harsh and uncouth by contrast; and if they gainsaid the voice, anger was kindled in the hearts of those under the spell. For some the spell lasted only while the voice spoke to them, and when it spake to another they smiled, as men do who see through a juggler's trick while others gape at it. For many the sound of the voice alone was enough to hold them enthralled; but for those whom it conquered the spell endured when they were far away, and ever they heard that soft voice whispering and urging them. But none were unmoved; none rejected its pleas and its commands without an effort of mind and will, so long as its master had control of it.\n\n'Well?' it said now with gentle question. 'Why must you disturb my rest? Will you give me no peace at all by night or day?' Its tone was that of a kindly heart aggrieved by injuries undeserved.\n\nThey looked up, astonished, for they had heard no sound of his coming; and they saw a figure standing at the rail, looking down upon them: an old man, swathed in a great cloak, the colour of which was not easy to tell, for it changed if they moved their eyes or if he stirred. His face was long, with a high forehead, he had deep darkling eyes, hard to fathom, though the look that they now bore was grave and benevolent, and a little weary. His hair and beard were white, but strands of black still showed about his lips and ears.\n\n'Like, and yet unlike,' muttered Gimli.\n\n'But come now,' said the soft voice. 'Two at least of you I know by name. Gandalf I know too well to have much hope that he seeks help or counsel here. But you, Theoden Lord of the Mark of Rohan are declared by your noble devices, and still more by the fair countenance of the House of Eorl. O worthy son of Thengel the Thrice-renowned! Why have you not come before, and as a friend? Much have I desired to see you, mightiest king of western lands, and especially in these latter years, to save you from the unwise and evil counsels that beset you! Is it yet too late? Despite the injuries that have been done to me, in which the men of Rohan, alas! have had some part, still I would save you, and deliver you from the ruin that draws nigh inevitably, if you ride upon this road which you have taken. Indeed I alone can aid you now.'\n\nTheoden opened his mouth as if to speak, but he said nothing. He looked up at the face of Saruman with its dark solemn eyes bent down upon him, and then to Gandalf at his side; and he seemed to hesitate. Gandalf made no sign; but stood silent as stone, as one waiting patiently for some call that has not yet come. The Riders stirred at first, murmuring with approval of the words of Saruman; and then they too were silent, as men spell-bound. It seemed to them that Gandalf had never spoken so fair and fittingly to their lord. Rough and proud now seemed all his dealings with Theoden. And over their hearts crept a shadow, the fear of a great danger: the end of the Mark in a darkness to which Gandalf was driving them, while Saruman stood beside a door of escape, holding it half open so that a ray of light came through. There was a heavy silence.\n\nIt was Gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenly. 'The words of this wizard stand on their heads,' he growled, gripping the handle of his axe. 'In the language of Orthanc help means ruin, and saving means slaying, that is plain. But we do not come here to beg.'\n\n'Peace!' said Saruman, and for a fleeting moment his voice was less suave, and a light flickered in his eyes and was gone. 'I do not speak to you yet, Gimli Gloin's son,' he said. 'Far away is your home and small concern of yours are the troubles of this land. But it was not by design of your own that you became embroiled in them, and so I will not blame such part as you have played \u0426 a valiant one, I doubt not. But I pray you, allow me first to speak with the King of Rohan, my neighbour, and once my friend.\n\n'What have you to say, Theoden King? Will you have peace with me, and all the aid that my knowledge, founded in long years, can bring? Shall we make our counsels together against evil days, and repair our injuries with such good will that our estates shall both come to fairer flower than ever before?'\n\nStill Theoden did not answer. Whether he strove with anger or doubt none could say. Eomer spoke.\n\n'Lord, hear me!' he said. 'Now we feel the peril that we were warned of. Have we ridden forth to victory, only to stand at last amazed by an old liar with honey on his forked tongue? So would the trapped wolf speak to the hounds, if he could. What aid can he give to you, forsooth? All he desires is to escape from his plight. But will you parley with this dealer in treachery and murder? Remember Theodred at the Fords, and the grave of Hama in Helm's Deep!'\n\n'If we speak of poisoned tongues what shall we say of yours, young serpent?' said Saruman, and the flash of his anger was now plain to see. 'But come, Eomer, Eomund's son!' he went on in his soft voice again. 'To every man his part. Valour in arms is yours, and you win high honour thereby. Slay whom your lord names as enemies, and be content. Meddle not in policies which you do not understand. But maybe, if you become a king, you will find that he must choose his friends with care. The friendship of Saruman and the power of Orthanc cannot be lightly thrown aside, whatever grievances, real or fancied, may lie behind. You have won a battle but not a war and that with help on which you cannot count again. You may find the Shadow of the Wood at your own door next: it is wayward, and senseless, and has no love for Men.\n\n'But my lord of Rohan, am I to be called a murderer, because valiant men have fallen in battle? If you go to war, needlessly, for I did not desire it, then men will be slain. But if I am a murderer on that account, then all the House of Eorl is stained with murder; for they have fought many wars, and assailed many who defied them. Yet with some they have afterwards made peace, none the worse for being politic. I say, Theoden King: shall we have peace and friendship, you and I? It is ours to command.'\n\n'We will have peace,' said Theoden at last thickly and with an effort. Several of the Riders cried out gladly. Theoden held up his hand. 'Yes, we will have peace,' he said, now in a clear voice, 'we will have peace, when you and all your works have perished \u0426 and the works of your dark master to whom you would deliver us. You are a liar, Saruman, and a corrupter of men's hearts. You hold out your hand to me, and I perceive only a finger of the claw of Mordor. Cruel and cold! Even if your war on me was just as it was not, for were you ten times as wise you would have no right to rule me and mine for your own profit as you desired \u0426 even so, what will you say of your torches in Westfold and the children that lie dead there? And they hewed Hama's body before the gates of the Hornburg, after he was dead. When you hang from a gibbet at your window for the sport of your own crows, I will have peace with you and Orthanc. So much for the House of Eorl. A lesser son of great sires am I, but I do not need to lick your fingers. Turn elsewhither. But I fear your voice has lost its charm.'\n\nThe Riders gazed up at Theoden like men startled out of a dream. Harsh as an old raven's their master's voice sounded in their ears after the music of Saruman. But Saruman for a while was beside himself with wrath. He leaned over the rail as if he would smite the King with his staff. To some suddenly it seemed that they saw a snake coiling itself to strike.\n\n'Gibbets and crows!' he hissed, and they shuddered at the hideous change. 'Dotard! What is the house of Eorl but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek, and their brats roll on the floor among the dogs? Too long have they escaped the gibbet themselves. But the noose comes, slow in the drawing, tight and hard in the end. Hang if you will!' Now his voice changed, as he slowly mastered himself. 'I know not why I have had the patience to speak to you. For I need you not, nor your little band of gallopers, as swift to fly as to advance, Theoden Horsemaster. Long ago I offered you a state beyond your merit and your wit. I have offered it again, so that those whom you mislead may clearly see the choice of roads. You give me brag and abuse. So be it. Go back to your huts!\n\n'But you, Gandalf! For you at least I am grieved, feeling for your shame. How comes it that you can endure such company? For you are proud, Gandalf \u0426 and not without reason, having a noble mind and eyes that look both deep and far. Even now will you not listen to my counsel?'\n\nGandalf stirred, and looked up. 'What have you to say that you did not say at our last meeting?' he asked. 'Or, perhaps, you have things to unsay?'\n\nSaruman paused. 'Unsay?' he mused, as if puzzled. 'Unsay? I endeavoured to advise you for your own good, but you scarcely listened. You are proud and do not love advice, having indeed a store of your own wisdom. But on that occasion you erred, I think, misconstruing my intentions wilfully. I fear that in my eagerness to persuade you, I lost patience. And indeed I regret it. For I bore you no ill-will; and even now I bear none, though you return to me in the company of the violent and the ignorant. How should I? Are we not both members of a high and ancient order, most excellent in Middle-earth? Our friendship would profit us both alike. Much we could still accomplish together, to heal the disorders of the world. Let us understand one another, and dismiss from thought these lesser folk! Let them wait on our decisions! For the common good I am willing to redress the past, and to receive you. Will you not consult with me? Will you not come up?'\n\nSo great was the power that Saruman exerted in this last effort that none that stood within hearing were unmoved. But now the spell was wholly different. They heard the gentle remonstrance of a kindly king with an erring but much-loved minister. But they were shut out, listening at a door to words not meant for them: ill-mannered children or stupid servants overhearing the elusive discourse of their elders, and wondering how it would affect their lot. Of loftier mould these two were made: reverend and wise. It was inevitable that they should make alliance. Gandalf would ascend into the tower, to discuss deep things beyond their comprehension in the high chambers of Orthanc. The door would be closed, and they would be left outside, dismissed to await allotted work or punishment. Even in the mind of Theoden the thought took shape, like a shadow of doubt: 'He will betray us; he will go \u0426 we shall be lost.'\n\nThen Gandalf laughed. The fantasy vanished like a puff of smoke.\n\n'Saruman, Saruman!' said Gandalf still laughing. 'Saruman, you missed your path in life. You should have been the king's jester and earned your bread, and stripes too, by mimicking his counsellors. Ah me!' he paused, getting the better of his mirth. 'Understand one another? I fear I am beyond your comprehension. But you, Saruman, I understand now too well. I keep a clearer memory of your arguments, and deeds, than you suppose. When last I visited you, you were the jailor of Mordor, and there I was to be sent. Nay, the guest who has escaped from the roof, will think twice before he comes back in by the door. Nay, I do not think I will come up. But listen, Saruman, for the last time! Will you not come down? Isengard has proved less strong than your hope and fancy made it. So may other things in which you still have trust. Would it not be well to leave it for a while? To turn to new things, perhaps? Think well, Saruman! Will you not come down?'\n\nA shadow passed over Saruman's face; then it went deathly white. Before he could conceal it, they saw through the mask the anguish of a mind in doubt, loathing to stay and dreading to leave its refuge. For a second he hesitated, and no one breathed. Then he spoke, and his voice was shrill and cold. Pride and hate were conquering him.\n\n'Will I come down?' he mocked. 'Does an unarmed man come down to speak with robbers out of doors? I can hear you well enough here. I am no fool, and I do not trust you, Gandalf. They do not stand openly on my stairs, but I know where the wild wood-demons are lurking, at your command.'\n\n'The treacherous are ever distrustful,' answered Gandalf wearily. 'But you need not fear for your skin. I do not wish to kill you, or hurt you, as you would know, if you really understood me. And I have the power to protect you. I am giving you a last chance. You can leave Orthanc, free \u0426 if you choose.'\n\n'That sounds well,' sneered Saruman. 'Very much in the manner of Gandalf the Grey: so condescending, and so very kind. I do not doubt that you would find Orthanc commodious, and my departure convenient. But why should I wish to leave? And what do you mean by 'free'? There are conditions, I presume?'\n\n'Reasons for leaving you can see from your windows,' answered Gandalf. 'Others will occur to your thought. Your servants are destroyed and scattered; your neighbours you have made your enemies; and you have cheated your new master, or tried to do so. When his eye turns hither, it will be the red eye of wrath. But when I say 'free', I mean 'free': free from bond, of chain or command; to go where you will, even, even to Mordor, Saruman, if you desire. But you will first surrender to me the Key of Orthanc, and your staff. They shall be pledges of your conduct, to be returned later, if you merit them.'\n\nSaruman's face grew livid, twisted with rage, and a red light was kindled in his eyes. He laughed wildly. 'Later!' he cried, and his voice rose to a scream. 'Later! Yes, when you also have the Keys of Barad-dur itself, I suppose; and the crowns of seven kings, and the rods of the Five Wizards, and have purchased yourself a pair of boots many sizes larger than those that you wear now. A modest plan. Hardly one in which my help is needed! I have other things to do. Do not be a fool. If you wish to treat with me, while you have a chance, go away, and come back when you are sober! And leave behind these cut-throats and small rag-tag that dangle at your tail! Good day!' He turned and left the balcony.\n\n'Come back, Saruman!' said Gandalf in a commanding voice. To the amazement of the others, Saruman turned again, and as if dragged against his will, he came slowly back to the iron rail, leaning on it, breathing hard. His face was lined and shrunken. His hand clutched his heavy black staff like a claw.\n\n'I did not give you leave to go,' said Gandalf sternly. 'I have not finished. You have become a fool, Saruman, and yet pitiable. You might still have turned away from folly and evil, and have been of service. But you choose to stay and gnaw the ends of your old plots. Stay then! But I warn you: you will not easily come out again. Not unless the dark hands of the East stretch out to take you, Saruman!' he cried, and his voice grew in power and authority. 'Behold, I am not Gandalf the Grey, whom you betrayed. I am Gandalf the White, who has returned from death. You have no colour now, and I cast you from the order and from the Council.'\n\nHe raised his hand, and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice. 'Saruman, your staff is broken.' There was a crack, and the staff split asunder in Saruman's hand, and the head of it fell down at Gandalf's feet. 'Go!' said Gandalf. With a cry Saruman fell back and crawled away. At that moment a heavy shining thing came hurtling down from above. It glanced off the iron rail, even as Saruman left it, and passing close to Gandalf's head, it smote the stair on which he stood. The rail rang and snapped. The stair cracked and splintered in glittering sparks. But the ball was unharmed: it rolled on down the steps, a globe of crystal, dark, but glowing with a heart of fire. As it bounded away towards a pool Pippin ran after it and picked it up.\n\n'The murderous rogue!' cried Eomer. But Gandalf was unmoved. No, that was not thrown by Saruman, he said, nor even at his bidding, I think. It came from a window far above. A parting shot from Master Wormtongue, I fancy, but ill aimed.'\n\n'The aim was poor, maybe, because he could not make up his mind which he hated more, you or Saruman,' said Aragorn.\n\n'That may be so,' said Gandalf. 'Small comfort will those two have in their companionship: they will gnaw one another with words. But the punishment is just. If Wormtongue ever comes out of Orthanc alive, it will be more than he deserves.\n\n'Here, my lad, I'll take that! I did not ask you to handle it,' he cried, turning sharply and seeing Pippin coming up the steps, slowly, as if he were bearing a great weight. He went down to meet him and hastily took the dark globe from the hobbit, wrapping it in the folds of his cloak. 'I will take care of this,' he said. 'It is not a thing, I guess, that Saruman would have chosen to cast away.'\n\n'But he may have other things to cast,' said Gimli. 'If that is the end of the debate, let us go out of stone's throw, at least!'\n\n'It is the end,' said Gandalf. 'Let us go.'\n\nThey turned their backs on the doors of Orthanc, and went down. The riders hailed the king with joy, and saluted Gandalf. The spell of Saruman was broken: they had seen him come at call, and crawl away, dismissed.\n\n'Well, that is done,' said Gandalf. 'Now I must find Treebeard and tell him how things have gone.'\n\n'He will have guessed, surely?' said Merry. 'Were they likely to end any other way?'\n\n'Not likely,' answered Gandalf, 'though they came to the balance of a hair. But I had reasons for trying; some merciful and some less so. First Saruman was shown that the power of his voice was waning. He cannot be both tyrant and counsellor. When the plot is ripe it remains no longer secret. Yet he fell into the trap, and tried to deal with his victims piece-meal, while others listened. Then I gave him a last choice and a fair one: to renounce both Mordor and his private schemes, and make amends by helping us in our need. He knows our need, none better. Great service he could have rendered. But he has chosen to withhold it, and keep the power of Orthanc. He will not serve, only command. He lives now in terror of the shadow of Mordor, and yet he still dreams of riding the storm. Unhappy fool! He will be devoured, if the power of the East stretches out its arms to Isengard. We cannot destroy Orthanc from without, but Sauron \u0426 who knows what he can do?'\n\n'And what if Sauron does not conquer? What will you do to him?' asked Pippin.\n\n'I? Nothing!' said Gandalf. 'I will do nothing to him. I do not wish for mastery. What will become of him? I cannot say. I grieve that so much that was good now festers in the tower. Still for us things have not gone badly. Strange are the turns of fortune! Often does hatred hurt itself! I guess that, even if we had entered in, we could have found few treasures in Orthanc more precious than the thing which Wormtongue threw down at us.'\n\nA shrill shriek, suddenly cut off, came from an open window high above.\n\n'It seems that Saruman thinks so too,' said Gandalf. 'Let us leave them!'\n\nThey returned now to the ruins of the gate. Hardly had they passed out under the arch, when, from among the shadows of the piled stones where they had stood, Treebeard and a dozen other Ents came striding up. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas gazed at them in wonder.\n\n'Here are three of my companions, Treebeard,' said Gandalf. 'I have spoken of them, but you have not yet seen them.' He named them one by one.\n\nThe Old Ent looked at them long and searchingly, and spoke to them in turn. Last he turned to Legolas. 'So you have come all the way from Mirkwood, my good Elf? A very great forest it used to be!'\n\n'And still is,' said Legolas. 'But not so great that we who dwell there ever tire of seeing new trees. I should dearly love to journey in Fangorn's Wood. I scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it, and I did not wish to turn back.'\n\nTreebeard's eyes gleamed with pleasure. 'I hope you may have your wish, ere the hills be much older,' he said.\n\n'I will come, if I have the fortune,' said Legolas. 'I have made a bargain with my friend that, if all goes well, we will visit Fangorn together \u0426 by your leave.'\n\n'Any Elf that comes with you will be welcome,' said Treebeard.\n\n'The friend I speak of is not an Elf,' said Legolas, 'I mean Gimli, Gloin's son here.' Gimli bowed low, and the axe slipped from his belt and clattered on the ground.\n\n'Hoom, hm! Ah now,' said Treebeard, looking dark-eyed at him. 'A dwarf and an axe-bearer! Hoom! I have good will to Elves; but you ask much. This is a strange friendship!'\n\n'Strange it may seem,' said Legolas, 'but while Gimli lives I shall not come to Fangorn alone. His axe is not for trees, but for orc-necks, O Fangorn, Master of Fangorn's Wood. Forty-two he hewed in the battle.'\n\n'Hoo! Come now!' said Treebeard. 'That is a better story! Well, well, things will go as they will; and there is no need to hurry to meet them. But now we must part for a while. Day is drawing to an end, yet Gandalf says you must go ere nightfall, and the Lord of the Mark is eager for his own house.'\n\n'Yes, we must go, and go now,' said Gandalf. 'I fear that I must take your gatekeepers from you. But you will manage well enough without them.'\n\n'Maybe I shall,' said Treebeard. 'But I shall miss them. We have become friends in so short a while that I think I must be getting hasty \u0426 growing backwards towards youth, perhaps. But there, they are the first new thing under Sun or Moon that I have seen for many a long, long day. I shall not forget them. I have put their names into the Long List. Ents will remember it.\n\n\t\tEnts the earthborn, old as mountains,\n\t\tthe wide-walkers, water drinking;\n\t\tand hungry as hunters, the Hobbit children,\n\t\tthe laughing-folk, the little people,\n\nthey shall remain friends as long as leaves are renewed. Fare you well! But if you hear news up in your pleasant land, in the Shire, send me word! You know what I mean: word or sight of the Entwives. Come yourselves if you can!'\n\n'We will!' said Merry and Pippin together, and they turned away hastily. Treebeard looked at them, and was silent for a while, shaking his head thoughtfully. Then he turned to Gandalf.\n\n'So Saruman would not leave?' he said. 'I did not think he would. His heart is as rotten as a black Huorn's. Still, if I were overcome and all my trees destroyed, I would not come while I had one dark hole left to hide in.'\n\n'No,' said Gandalf. 'But you have not plotted to cover all the world with your trees and choke all other living things. But there it is, Saruman remains to nurse his hatred and weave again such webs as he can. He has the Key of Orthanc. But he must not be allowed to escape.'\n\n'Indeed no! Ents will see to that,' said Treebeard. 'Saruman shall not set foot beyond the rock, without my leave. Ents will watch over him.'\n\n'Good!' said Gandalf. 'That is what I hoped. Now I can go and turn to other matters with one care the less. But you must be wary. The waters have gone down. It will not be enough to put sentinels round the tower, I fear. I do not doubt that there were deep ways delved under Orthanc, and that Saruman hopes to go and come unmarked, before long. If you will undertake the labour, I beg you to pour in the waters again; and do so, until Isengard remains a standing pool, or you discover the outlets. When all the underground places are drowned, and the outlets blocked, then Saruman must stay upstairs and look out of the windows.'\n\n'Leave it to the Ents!' said Treebeard. 'We shall search the valley from head to foot and peer under every pebble. Trees are coming back to live here, old trees, wild trees. The Watchwood we will call it. Not a squirrel will go here, but I shall know of it. Leave it to Ents! Until seven times the years in which he tormented us have passed, we shall not tire of watching him.'\n\n\n\nChapter 11\n\nThe Palantir\n\nThe sun was sinking behind the long western arm of the mountains when Gandalf and his companions, and the king with his Riders, set out again from Isengard. Gandalf took Merry behind him, and Aragorn took Pippin. Two of the king's men went on ahead, riding swiftly, and passed soon out of sight down into the valley. The others followed at an easy pace.\n\nEnts in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate, with their long arms uplifted, but they made no sound. Merry and Pippin looked back, when they had passed some way down the winding road. Sunlight was still shining in the sky, but long shadows reached over Isengard: grey ruins falling into darkness. Treebeard stood alone there now, like the distant stump of an old tree: the hobbits thought of their first meeting, upon the sunny ledge far away on the borders of Fangorn.\n\nThey came to the pillar of the White Hand. The pillar was still standing, but the graven hand had been thrown down and broken into small pieces. Right in the middle of the road the long forefinger lay, white in the dusk, its red nail darkening to black.\n\n'The Ents pay attention to every detail!' said Gandalf.\n\nThey rode on, and evening deepened in the valley.\n\n'Are we riding far tonight, Gandalf?' asked Merry after a while. 'I don't know how you feel with small rag-tag dangling behind you; but the rag-tag is tired and will be glad to stop dangling and lie down.'\n\n'So you heard that?' said Gandalf. 'Don't let it rankle! Be thankful no longer words were aimed at you. He had his eyes on you. If it is any comfort to your pride, I should say that, at the moment, you and Pippin are more in his thoughts than all the rest of us. Who you are; how you came there, and why; what you know; whether you were captured, and if so, how you escaped when all the Orcs perished \u0426 it is with those little riddles that the great mind of Saruman is troubled. A sneer from him, Meriadoc, is a compliment, if you feel honoured by his concern.'\n\n'Thank you!' said Merry. 'But it is a greater honour to dangle at your tail, Gandalf. For one thing, in that position one has a chance of putting a question a second time. Are we riding far tonight?'\n\nGandalf laughed. 'A most unquenchable hobbit! All Wizards should have a hobbit or two in their care \u0426 to teach them the meaning of the word, and to correct them. I beg your pardon. But I have given thought even to these simple matters. We will ride for a few hours, gently, until we come to the end of the valley. Tomorrow we must ride faster.\n\n'When we came, we meant to go straight from Isengard back to the king's house at Edoras over the plains, a ride of some days. But we have taken thought and changed the plan. Messengers have gone ahead to Helm's Deep, to warn them that the king is returning tomorrow. He will ride from there with many men to Dunharrow by paths among the hills. From now on no more than two or three together are to go openly over the land, by day or night, when it can be avoided.'\n\n'Nothing or a double helping is your way!' said Merry. 'I am afraid I was not looking beyond tonight's bed. Where and what are Helm's Deep and all the rest of it? I don't know anything about this country.'\n\n'Then you'd best learn something, if you wish to understand what is happening. But not just now, and not from me: I have too many pressing things to think about.'\n\n'All right, I'll tackle Strider by the camp-fire: he's less testy. But why all this secrecy? I thought we'd won the battle!'\n\n'Yes, we have won, but only the first victory and that in itself increases our danger. There was some link between Isengard and Mordor, which I have not yet fathomed. How they exchanged news I am not sure; but they did so. The Eye of Barad-dur will be looking impatiently towards the Wizard's Vale, I think; and towards Rohan. The less it sees the better.'\n\nThe road passed slowly, winding down the valley. Now further, and now nearer Isen flowed in its stony bed. Night came down from the mountains. All the mists were gone. A chill wind blew. The moon, now waxing round, filled the eastern sky with a pale cold sheen. The shoulders of the mountain to their right sloped down to bare hills. The wide plains opened grey before them.\n\nAt last they halted. Then they turned aside, leaving the highway and taking to the sweet upland turf again. Going westward a mile or so they came to a dale. It opened southward, leaning back into the slope of round Dol Baran, the last hill of the northern ranges, greenfooted, crowned with heather. The sides of the glen were shaggy with last year's bracken, among which the tight-curled fronds of spring were just thrusting through the sweet-scented earth. Thornbushes grew thick upon the low banks, and under them they made their camp, two hours or so before the middle of the night. They lit a fire in a hollow, down among the roots of a spreading hawthorn, tall as a tree, writhen with age; but hale in every limb. Buds were swelling at each twig's tip.\n\nGuards were set, two at a watch. The rest, after they had supped, wrapped themselves in a cloak and blanket and slept. The hobbits lay in a corner by themselves upon a pile of old bracken. Merry was sleepy, but Pippin now seemed curiously restless. The bracken cracked and rustled, as he twisted and turned.\n\n'What's the matter?' asked Merry. 'Are you lying on an ant-hill?'\n\n'No,' said Pippin, 'but I'm not comfortable. I wonder how long it is since I slept in a bed?'\n\nMerry yawned. 'Work it out on your fingers!' he said. 'But you must know how long it is since we left Lorien.'\n\n'Oh, that!' said Pippin. 'I mean a real bed in a bedroom.'\n\n'Well, Rivendell then,' said Merry. 'But I could sleep anywhere tonight.'\n\n'You had the luck, Merry,' said Pippin softly, after a long pause. 'You were riding with Gandalf.'\n\n'Well, what of it?'\n\n'Did you get any news, any information out of him?'\n\n'Yes, a good deal. More than usual. But you heard it all or most of it: you were close by, and we were talking no secrets. But you can go with him tomorrow, if you think you can get more out of him \u0426 and if he'll have you.'\n\n'Can I? Good! But he's close, isn't he? Not changed at all.'\n\n'Oh yes, he is!' said Merry, waking up a little, and beginning to wonder what was bothering his companion. 'He has grown, or something. He can be both kinder and more alarming, merrier and more solemn than before, I think. He has changed; but we have not had a chance to see how much, yet. But think of the last part of that business with Saruman! Remember Saruman was once Gandalf's superior: head of the Council, whatever that may be exactly. He was Saruman the White. Gandalf is the White now. Saruman came when he was told, and his rod was taken; and then he was just told to go, and he went!'\n\n'Well, if Gandalf has changed at all, then he's closer than ever that's all,' Pippin argued. 'That-glass ball, now. He seemed mighty pleased with it. He knows or guesses something about it. But does he tell us what? No, not a word. Yet I picked it up, and I saved it from rolling into a pool. Here, I'll take that, my lad \u0426 that's all. I wonder what it is? It felt so very heavy.' Pippin's voice fell very low as if he was talking to himself.\n\n'Hullo!' said Merry. 'So that's what is bothering you? Now, Pippin my lad, don't forget Gildor's saying \u0426 the one Sam used to quote: Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.'\n\n'But our whole life for months has been one long meddling in the affairs of Wizards,' said Pippin. 'I should like a bit of information as well as danger. I should like a look at that ball.'\n\n'Go to sleep!' said Merry. 'You'll get information enough, sooner or later. My dear Pippin, no Took ever beat a Brandybuck for inquisitiveness; but is this the time, I ask you?'\n\n'All right! What's the harm in my telling you what I should like: a look at that stone? I know I can't have it, with old Gandalf sitting on it, like a hen on an egg. But it doesn't help much to get no more from you than a you-can't-have-it-so-go-to-sleep!'\n\n'Well, what else could I say?' said Merry. 'I'm sorry, Pippin, but you really must wait till the morning. I'll be as curious as you like after breakfast, and I'll help in any way I can at wizard-wheedling. But I can't keep awake any longer. If I yawn any more, I shall split at the ears. Good night!'\n\nPippin said no more. He lay still now, but sleep remained far away; and it was not encouraged by the sound of Merry breathing softly, asleep in a few minutes after saying good night. The thought of the dark globe seemed to grow stronger as all grew quiet. Pippin felt again its weight in his hands, and saw again the mysterious red depths into which he had looked for a moment. He tossed and turned and tried to think of something else.\n\nAt last he could stand it no longer. He got up and looked round. It was chilly, and he wrapped his cloak about him. The moon was shining cold and white, down into the dell, and the shadows of the bushes were black. All about lay sleeping shapes. The two guards were not in view: they were up on the hill, perhaps, or hidden in the bracken. Driven by some impulse that he did not understand, Pippin walked softly to where Gandalf lay. He looked down at him. The wizard seemed asleep, but with lids not fully closed: there was a glitter of eyes under his long lashes. Pippin stepped back hastily. But Gandalf made no sign; and drawn forward once more, half against his will, the hobbit crept up again from behind the wizard's head. He was rolled in a blanket, with his cloak spread over the top; and close beside him, between his right side and his bent arm, there was a hummock, something round wrapped in a dark cloth; his hand seemed only just to have slipped off it to the ground.\n\nHardly breathing, Pippin crept nearer, foot by foot. At last he knelt down. Then he put his hands out stealthily, and slowly lifted the lump up: it did not seem quite so heavy as he had expected. 'Only some bundle of oddments, perhaps, after all,' he thought with a strange sense of relief; but he did not put the bundle down again. He stood for a moment clasping it. Then an idea came into his mind. He tiptoed away, found a large stone, and came back.\n\nQuickly now he drew off the cloth, wrapped the stone in it and kneeling down, laid it back by the wizard's hand. Then at last he looked at the thing that he had uncovered. There it was: a smooth globe of crystal, now dark and dead, lying bare before his knees. Pippin lifted it, covered it hurriedly in his own cloak, and half turned to go back to his bed. At that moment Gandalf moved in his sleep, and muttered some words: they seemed to be in a strange tongue; his hand groped out and clasped the wrapped stone, then he sighed and did not move again.\n\n'You idiotic fool!' Pippin muttered to himself. 'You're going to get yourself into frightful trouble. Put it back quick!' But he found now that his knees quaked, and he did not dare to go near enough to the wizard to reach the bundle. 'I'll never get it back now without waking him,' he thought, 'not till I'm a bit calmer. So I may as well have a look first. Not just here though!' He stole away, and sat down on a green hillock not far from his bed. The moon looked in over the edge of the dell.\n\nPippin sat with his knees drawn up and the ball between them. He bent low over it, looking like a greedy child stooping over a bowl of food, in a corner away from others. He drew his cloak aside and gazed at it. The air seemed still and tense about him. At first the globe was dark, black as jet, with the moonlight gleaming on its surface. Then there came a faint glow and stir in the heart of it, and it held his eyes, so that now he could not look away. Soon all the inside seemed on fire; the ball was spinning, or the lights within were revolving. Suddenly the lights went out. He gave a gasp and struggled; but he remained bent, clasping the ball with both hands. Closer and closer he bent, and then became rigid; his lips moved soundlessly for a while. Then with a strangled cry he fell back and lay still.\n\nThe cry was piercing. The guards leapt down from the banks. All the camp was soon astir.\n\n'So this is the thief!' said Gandalf. Hastily he cast his cloak over the globe where it lay. 'But you, Pippin! This is a grievous turn to things!' He knelt by Pippin's body: the hobbit was lying on his back rigid, with unseeing eyes staring up at the sky. 'The devilry! What mischief has he done \u0426 to himself, and to all of us?' The wizard's face was drawn and haggard.\n\nHe took Pippin's hand and bent over his face, listening for his breath; then he laid his hands on his brow. The hobbit shuddered. His eyes closed. He cried out and sat up, staring in bewilderment at all the faces round him, pale in the moonlight.\n\n'It is not for you, Saruman!' he cried in a shrill and toneless voice shrinking away from Gandalf. 'I will send for it at once. Do you understand? Say just that!' Then he struggled to get up and escape but Gandalf held him gently and firmly.\n\n'Peregrin Took!' he said. 'Come back!'\n\nThe hobbit relaxed and fell back, clinging to the wizard's hand. 'Gandalf!' he cried. 'Gandalf! Forgive me!'\n\n'Forgive you?' said the wizard. 'Tell me first what you have done!'\n\n'I, I took the ball and looked at it,' stammered Pippin, 'and I saw things that frightened me. And I wanted to go away, but I couldn't. And then he came and questioned me; and he looked at me, and, and that is all I remember.'\n\n'That won't do,' said Gandalf sternly. 'What did you see, and what did you say?'\n\nPippin shut his eyes and shivered, but said nothing. They all stared at him in silence, except Merry who turned away. But Gandalf's face was still hard. 'Speak!' he said.\n\nIn a low hesitating voice Pippin began again, and slowly his words grew clearer and stronger. 'I saw a dark sky, and tall battlements,' he said. 'And tiny stars. It seemed very far away and long ago, yet hard and clear. Then the stars went in and out \u0426 they were cut off by things with wings. Very big, I think, really; but in the glass they looked like bats wheeling round the tower. I thought there were nine of them. One began to fly straight towards me, getting bigger and bigger. It had a horrible \u0426 no, no! I can't say.\n\n'I tried to get away, because I thought it would fly out; but when it had covered all the globe, it disappeared. Then he came. He did not speak so that I could hear words. He just looked, and I understood.\n\n'\"So you have come back? Why have you neglected to report for so long?\"\n\n'I did not answer. He said: \"Who are you?\" I still did not answer, but it hurt me horribly; and he pressed me, so I said: \"A hobbit.\"\n\n'Then suddenly he seemed to see me, and he laughed at me. It was cruel. It was like being stabbed with knives. I struggled. But he said: \"Wait a moment! We shall meet again soon. Tell Saruman that this dainty is not for him. I will send for it at once. Do you understand? Say just that!\"\n\n'Then he gloated over me. I felt I was falling to pieces. No, no! I can't say any more. I don't remember anything else.'\n\n'Look at me!' said Gandalf.\n\nPippin looked up straight into his eyes. The wizard held his gaze for a moment in silence. Then his face grew gentler, and the shadow of a smile appeared. He laid his hand softly on Pippin's head.\n\n'All right!' he said. 'Say no more! You have taken no harm. There is no lie in your eyes, as I feared. But he did not speak long with you. A fool, but an honest fool, you remain, Peregrin Took. Wiser ones might have done worse in such a pass. But mark this! You have been saved, and all your friends too, mainly by good fortune, as it is called. You cannot count on it a second time. If he had questioned you, then and there, almost certainly you would have told all that you know, to the ruin of us all. But he was too eager. He did not want information only: he wanted you, quickly, so that he could deal with you in the Dark Tower, slowly. Don't shudder! If you will meddle in the affairs of Wizards, you must be prepared to think of such things. But come! I forgive you. Be comforted! Things have not turned out as evilly as they might.'\n\nHe lifted Pippin gently and carried him back to his bed. Merry followed, and sat down beside him. Lie there and rest, if you can, Pippin!' said Gandalf. 'Trust me. If you feel an itch in your palms again, tell me of it! Such things can be cured. But anyway, my dear hobbit, don't put a lump of rock under my elbow again! Now, I will leave you two together for a while.'\n\nWith that Gandalf returned to the others, who were still standing by the Orthanc-stone in troubled thought. 'Peril comes in the night when least expected,' he said. 'We have had a narrow escape!'\n\n'How is the hobbit, Pippin?' asked Aragorn.\n\n'I think all will be well now,' answered Gandalf. 'He was not held long, and hobbits have an amazing power of recovery. The memory, or the horror of it, will probably fade quickly. Too quickly, perhaps. Will you, Aragorn, take the Orthanc-stone and guard it? It is a dangerous charge.'\n\n'Dangerous indeed, but not to all,' said Aragorn. 'There is one who may claim it by right. For this assuredly is the palantir of Orthanc from the treasury of Elendil, set here by the Kings of Gondor. Now my hour draws near. I will take it.'\n\nGandalf looked at Aragorn, and then, to the surprise of the others, he lifted the covered Stone, and bowed as he presented it.\n\n'Receive it, lord!' he said, 'in earnest of other things that shall be given back. But if I may counsel you in the use of your own, do not use it \u0426 yet! Be wary!'\n\n'When have I been hasty or unwary, who have waited and prepared for so many long years?' said Aragorn.\n\n'Never yet. Do not then stumble at the end of the road,' answered Gandalf. 'But at the least keep this thing secret. You, and all others that stand here! The hobbit, Peregrin, above all should not know where it is bestowed. The evil fit may come on him again. For alas! he has handled it and looked in it, as should never have happened. He ought never to have touched it in Isengard, and there I should have been quicker. But my mind was bent on Saruman, and I did not at once guess the nature of the Stone. Then I was weary, and as I lay pondering it, sleep overcame me. Now I know!'\n\n'Yes, there can be no doubt,' said Aragorn. 'At last we know the link between Isengard and Mordor, and how it worked. Much is explained.'\n\n'Strange powers have our enemies, and strange weaknesses!' said Theoden. 'But it has long been said: oft evil will shall evil mar.'\n\n'That many times is seen,' said Gandalf. 'But at this time we have been strangely fortunate. Maybe, I have been saved by this hobbit from a grave blunder. I had considered whether or not to probe this Stone myself to find its uses. Had I done so, I should have been revealed to him myself. I am not ready for such a trial, if indeed I shall ever be so. But even if I found the power to withdraw myself, it would be disastrous for him to see me, yet \u0426 until the hour comes when secrecy will avail no longer.'\n\n'That hour is now come, I think,' said Aragorn.\n\n'Not yet,' said Gandalf. 'There remains a short while of doubt which we must use. The Enemy, it is clear, thought that the Stone was in Orthanc \u0426 why should he not? And that therefore the hobbit was captive there, driven to look in the glass for his torment by Saruman. That dark mind will be filled now with the voice and face of the hobbit and with expectation: it may take some time before he learns his error. We must snatch that time. We have been too leisurely. We must move. The neighbourhood of Isengard is no place now to linger in. I will ride ahead at once with Peregrin Took. It will be better for him than lying in the dark while others sleep.'\n\n'I will keep Eomer and ten Riders,' said the king. 'They shall ride with me at early day. The rest may go with Aragorn and ride as soon as they have a mind.'\n\n'As you will,' said Gandalf. 'But make all the speed you may to the cover of the hills, to Helm's Deep!'\n\nAt that moment a shadow fell over them. The bright moonlight seemed to be suddenly cut off. Several of the Riders cried out, and crouched, holding their arms above their heads, as if to ward off a blow from above: a blind fear and a deadly cold fell on them. Cowering they looked up. A vast winged shape passed over the moon like a black cloud. It wheeled and went north, flying at a speed greater than any wind of Middle-earth. The stars fainted before it. It was gone.\n\nThey stood up, rigid as stones. Gandalf was gazing up, his arms out and downwards, stiff, his hands clenched.\n\n'Nazgul!' he cried. 'The messenger of Mordor. The storm is coming. The Nazgul have crossed the River! Ride, ride! Wait not for the dawn! Let not the swift wait for the slow! Ride!'\n\nHe sprang away, calling Shadowfax as he ran. Aragorn followed him. Going to Pippin, Gandalf picked him up in his arms. 'You shall come with me this time,' he said. 'Shadowfax shall show you his paces.' Then he ran to the place where he had slept. Shadowfax stood there already. Slinging the small bag which was all his luggage across his shoulders, the wizard leapt upon the horse's back. Aragorn lifted Pippin and set him in Gandalf's arms, wrapped in cloak and blanket.\n\n'Farewell! Follow fast!' cried Gandalf. 'Away, Shadowfax!'\n\nThe great horse tossed his head. His flowing tail flicked in the moonlight. Then he leapt forward, spurning the earth, and was gone like the north wind from the mountains.\n\n'A beautiful, restful night!' said Merry to Aragorn. 'Some folk have wonderful luck. He did not want to sleep, and he wanted to ride with Gandalf \u0426 and there he goes! Instead of being turned into a stone himself to stand here for ever as a warning.'\n\n'If you had been the first to lift the Orthanc-stone, and not he, how would it be now?' said Aragorn. 'You might have done worse. Who can say? But now it is your luck to come with me, I fear. At once. Go and get ready, and bring anything that Pippin left behind. Make haste!'\n\nOver the plains Shadowfax was flying, needing no urging and no guidance. Less than an hour had passed, and they had reached the Fords of Isen and crossed them. The Mound of the Riders and its cold spears lay grey behind them.\n\nPippin was recovering. He was warm, but the wind in his face was keen and refreshing. He was with Gandalf. The horror of the stone and of the hideous shadow over the moon was fading, things left behind in the mists of the mountains or in a passing dream. He drew a deep breath.\n\n'I did not know you rode bare-back, Gandalf,' he said. 'You haven't a saddle or a bridle!'\n\n'I do not ride elf-fashion, except on Shadowfax,' said Gandalf. 'But Shadowfax will have no harness. You do not ride Shadowfax: he is willing to carry you \u0426 or not. If he is willing, that is enough. It is then his business to see that you remain on his back, unless you jump off into the air.'\n\n'How fast is he going?' asked Pippin. 'Fast by the wind, but very smooth. And how light his footfalls are!'\n\n'He is running now as fast as the swiftest horse could gallop,' answered Gandalf, 'but that is not fast for him. The land is rising a little here, and is more broken than it was beyond the river. But see how the White Mountains are drawing near under the stars! Yonder are the Thrihyrne peaks like black spears. It will not be long before we reach the branching roads and come to the Deeping-coomb, where the battle was fought two nights ago.'\n\nPippin was silent again for a while. He heard Gandalf singing softly to himself, murmuring brief snatches of rhyme in many tongues, as the miles ran under them. At last the wizard passed into a song of which the hobbit caught the words: a few lines came clear to his ears through the rushing of the wind:\n\n\t\tTall ships and tall kings\n\t\tThree times three,\n\t\tWhat brought they from the foundered land\n\t\tOver the flowing sea?\n\t\tSeven stars and seven stones\n\t\tAnd one white tree.\n\n'What are you saying, Gandalf?' asked Pippin.\n\n'I was just running over some of the Rhymes of Lore in my mind,' answered the wizard. 'Hobbits, I suppose, have forgotten them, even those that they ever knew.'\n\n'No, not all,' said Pippin. 'And we have many of our own, which wouldn't interest you, perhaps. But I have never heard this one. What is it about \u0426 the seven stars and seven stones?'\n\n'About the palantiri of the Kings of Old,' said Gandalf.\n\n'And what are they?'\n\n'The name meant that which looks far away. The Orthanc-stone was one.'\n\n'Then it was not made, not made' \u0426 Pippin hesitated \u0426 'by the Enemy?'\n\n'No,' said Gandalf. 'Nor by Saruman. It is beyond his art, and beyond Sauron's too. The palantiri came from beyond Westernesse from Eldamar. The Noldor made them. Feanor himself, maybe, wrought them, in days so long ago that the time cannot be measured in years. But there is nothing that Sauron cannot turn to evil uses. Alas for Saruman! It was his downfall, as I now perceive. Perilous to us all are the devices of an art deeper than we possess ourselves. Yet he must bear the blame. Fool! to keep it secret, for his own profit. No word did he ever speak of it to any of the Council. We had not yet given thought to the fate of the palantiri of Gondor in its ruinous wars. By Men they were almost forgotten. Even in Gondor they were a secret known only to a few; in Arnor they were remembered only in a rhyme of lore among the Dunedain.'\n\n'What did the Men of old use them for?' asked Pippin, delighted and astonished at getting answers to so many questions, and wondering how long it would last.\n\n'To see far off, and to converse in thought with one another,' said Gandalf. 'In that way they long guarded and united the realm of Gondor. They set up Stones at Minas Anor, and at Minas Ithil, and at Orthanc in the ring of Isengard. The chief and master of these was under the Dome of Stars at Osgiliath before its ruin. The three others were far away in the North. In the house of Elrond it is told that they were at Annuminas, and Amon Sul, and Elendil's Stone was on the Tower Hills that look towards Mithlond in the Gulf of Lune where the grey ships lie.\n\n'Each palantir replied to each, but all those in Gondor were ever open to the view of Osgiliath. Now it appears that, as the rock of Orthanc has withstood the storms of time, so there the palantir of that tower has remained. But alone it could do nothing but see small images of things far off and days remote. Very useful, no doubt, that was to Saruman; yet it seems that he was not content. Further and further abroad he gazed, until he cast his gaze upon Barad-dur. Then he was caught!\n\n'Who knows where the lost Stones of Arnor and Gondor now lie buried, or drowned deep? But one at least Sauron must have obtained and mastered to his purposes. I guess that it was the Ithil-stone, for he took Minas Ithil long ago and turned it into an evil place: Minas Morgul, it has become.\n\n'Easy it is now to guess how quickly the roving eye of Saruman was trapped and held; and how ever since he has been persuaded from afar, and daunted when persuasion would not serve. The biter bit, the hawk under the eagle's foot, the spider in a steel web! How long, I wonder, has he been constrained to come often to his glass for inspection and instruction, and the Orthanc-stone so bent towards Barad-dur that, if any save a will of adamant now looks into it, it will bear his mind and sight swiftly thither? And how it draws one to itself! Have I not felt it? Even now my heart desires to test my will upon it, to see if I could not wrench it from him and turn it where I would \u0426 to look across the wide seas of water and of time to Tirion the Fair, and perceive the unimaginable hand and mind of Feanor at their work, while both the White Tree and the Golden were in flower!' He sighed and fell silent.\n\n'I wish I had known all this before,' said Pippin. 'I had no notion of what I was doing.'\n\n'Oh yes, you had,' said Gandalf. 'You knew you were behaving wrongly and foolishly; and you told yourself so, though you did not listen. I did not tell you all this before, because it is only by musing on all that has happened that I have at last understood, even as we ride together. But if I had spoken sooner, it would not have lessened your desire, or made it easier to resist. On the contrary! No, the burned hand teaches best. After that advice about fire goes to the heart.'\n\n'It does,' said Pippin. 'If all the seven stones were laid out before me now, I should shut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets.'\n\n'Good!' said Gandalf. 'That is what I hoped.'\n\n'But I should like to know\u0426' Pippin began.\n\n'Mercy!' cried Gandalf. 'If the giving of information is to be the cure of your inquisitiveness, I shall spend all the rest of my days in answering you. What more do you want to know?'\n\n'The names of all the stars, and of all living things, and the whole history of Middle-earth and Over-heaven and of the Sundering Seas,' laughed Pippin. 'Of course! What less? But I am not in a hurry tonight. At the moment I was just wondering about the black shadow. I heard you shout \"messenger of Mordor\". What was it? What could it do at Isengard?'\n\n'It was a Black Rider on wings, a Nazgul,' said Gandalf. 'It could have taken you away to the Dark Tower.'\n\n'But it was not coming for me, was it?' faltered Pippin. 'I mean, it didn't know that I had\u0415 '\n\n'Of course not,' said Gandalf. 'It is two hundred leagues or more in straight flight from Barad-dur to Orthanc, and even a Nazgul would take a few hours to fly between them. But Saruman certainly looked in the Stone since the orc-raid, and more of his secret thought, I do not doubt, has been read than he intended. A messenger has been sent to find out what he is doing. And after what has happened tonight another will come, I think, and swiftly. So Saruman will come to the last pinch of the vice that he has put his hand in. He has no captive to send. He has no Stone to see with, and cannot answer the summons. Sauron will only believe that he is withholding the captive and refusing to use the Stone. It will not help Saruman to tell the truth to the messenger. For Isengard may be ruined, yet he is still safe in Orthanc. So whether he will or no, he will appear a rebel. Yet he rejected us, so as to avoid that very thing! What he will do in such a plight, I cannot guess. He has power still, I think, while in Orthanc, to resist the Nine Riders. He may try to do so. He may try to trap the Nazgul, or at least to slay the thing on which it now rides the air. In that case let Rohan look to its horses!\n\n'But I cannot tell how it will fall out, well or ill for us. It may be that the counsels of the Enemy will be confused, or hindered by his wrath with Saruman. It may be that he will learn that I was there and stood upon the stairs of Orthanc \u0426 with hobbits at my tail. Or that an heir of Elendil lives and stood beside me. If Wormtongue was not deceived by the armour of Rohan, he would remember Aragorn and the title that he claimed. That is what I fear. And so we fly \u0426 not from danger but into greater danger. Every stride of Shadowfax bears you nearer to the Land of Shadow, Peregrin Took.'\n\nPippin made no answer, but clutched his cloak, as if a sudden chill had struck him. Grey land passed under them.\n\n'See now!' said Gandalf. 'The Westfold dales are opening before us. Here we come back to the eastward road. The dark shadow yonder is the mouth of the Deeping-coomb. That way lies Aglarond and the Glittering Caves. Do not ask me about them. Ask Gimli, if you meet again, and for the first time you may get an answer longer than you wish. You will not see the caves yourself, not on this journey. Soon they will be far behind.'\n\n'I thought you were going to stop at Helm's Deep!' said Pippin. 'Where are you going then?'\n\n'To Minas Tirith, before the seas of war surround it.'\n\n'Oh! And how far is that?'\n\n'Leagues upon leagues,' answered Gandalf. 'Thrice as far as the dwellings of King Theoden, and they are more than a hundred miles east from here, as the messengers of Mordor fly. Shadowfax must run a longer road. Which will prove the swifter?\n\n'We shall ride now till daybreak, and that is some hours away. Then even Shadowfax must rest, in some hollow of the hills: at Edoras, I hope. Sleep, if you can! You may see the first glimmer of dawn upon the golden roof of the house of Eorl. And in two days thence you shall see the purple shadow of Mount Mindolluin and the walls of the tower of Denethor white in the morning.\n\n'Away now, Shadowfax! Run, greatheart, run as you have never run before! Now we are come to the lands where you were foaled and every stone you know. Run now! Hope is in speed!'\n\nShadowfax tossed his head and cried aloud, as if a trumpet had summoned him to battle. Then he sprang forward. Fire flew from his feet; night rushed over him.\n\nAs he fell slowly into sleep, Pippin had a strange feeling: he and Gandalf were still as stone, seated upon the statue of a running horse, while the world rolled away beneath his feet with a great noise of wind.\n\n\n\nBook IV\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Taming of Smeagol\n\n'Well, master, we're in a fix and no mistake,' said Sam Gamgee. He stood despondently with hunched shoulders beside Frodo, and peered out with puckered eyes into the gloom.\n\nIt was the third evening since they had fled from the Company, as far as they could tell: they had almost lost count of the hours during which they had climbed and laboured among the barren slopes and stones of the Emyn Muil, sometimes retracing their steps because they could find no way forward, sometimes discovering that they had wandered in a circle back to where they had been hours before. Yet on the whole they had worked steadily eastward, keeping as near as they could find a way to the outer edge of this strange twisted knot of hills. But always they found its outward faces sheer, high and impassable, frowning over the plain below; beyond its tumbled skirts lay livid festering marshes where nothing moved and not even a bird was to be seen.\n\nThe hobbits stood now on the brink of a tall cliff, bare and bleak, its feet wrapped in mist; and behind them rose the broken highlands crowned with drifting cloud. A chill wind' blew from the East. Night was gathering over the shapeless lands before them; the sickly green of them was fading to a sullen brown. Far away to the right the Anduin, that had gleamed fitfully in sun-breaks during the day, was now hidden in shadow. But their eyes did not look beyond the River, back to Gondor, to their friends, to the lands of Men. South and east they stared to where at the edge of the oncoming night, a dark line hung, like distant mountains of motionless smoke. Every now and again a tiny red gleam far away flickered upwards on the rim of earth and sky.\n\n'What a fix!' said Sam. 'That's the one place in all the lands we've ever heard of that we don't want to see any closer; and that's the one place we're trying to get to! And that's just where we can't get, nohow. We've come the wrong way altogether, seemingly. We can't get down; and if we did get down, we'd find all that green land a nasty bog, I'll warrant. Phew! Can you smell it?' He sniffed at the wind.\n\n'Yes, I can smell it,' said Frodo, but he did not move, and his eyes remained fixed, staring out towards the dark line and the flickering flame. 'Mordor!' he muttered under his breath. 'If I must go there I wish I could come there quickly and make an end!' He shuddered. The wind was chilly and yet heavy with an odour of cold decay. 'Well,' he said, at last withdrawing his eyes, 'we cannot stay here all night, fix or no fix. We must find a more sheltered spot, and camp once more; and perhaps another day will show us a path.'\n\n'Or another and another and another,' muttered Sam. 'Or maybe no day. We've come the wrong way.'\n\n'I wonder,' said Frodo. 'It's my doom, I think, to go to that Shadow yonder, so that a way will be found. But will good or evil show it to me? What hope we had was in speed. Delay plays into the Enemy's hands \u0426 and here I am: delayed. Is it the will of the Dark Tower that steers us? All my choices have proved ill. I should have left the Company long before, and come down from the North, east of the River and of the Emyn Muil, and so over the hard of Battle Plain to the passes of Mordor. But now it isn't possible for you and me alone to find a way back, and the Orcs are prowling on the east bank. Every day that passes is a precious day lost. I am tired, Sam. I don't know what is to be done. What food have we got left?'\n\n'Only those, what d'you call 'em, lembas, Mr. Frodo. A fair supply. But they are better than naught, by a long bite. I never thought, though, when I first set tooth in them, that I should ever come to wish for a change. But I do now: a bit of plain bread, and a mug \u0426 aye, half a mug \u0426 of beer would go down proper. I've lugged my cooking-gear all the way from the last camp, and what use has it been? Naught to make a fire with, for a start; and naught to cook, not even grass!'\n\nThey turned away and went down into a stony hollow. The westering sun was caught into clouds, and night came swiftly. They slept as well as they could for the cold, turn and turn about, in a nook among great jagged pinnacles of weathered rock; at least they were sheltered from the easterly wind.\n\n'Did you see them again, Mr. Frodo?' asked Sam, as they sat, stiff and chilled, munching wafers of lembas, in the cold grey of early morning.\n\n'No,' said Frodo. 'I've heard nothing, and seen nothing, for two nights now.'\n\n'Nor me,' said Sam. 'Grrr! Those eyes did give me a turn! But perhaps we've shaken him off at last, the miserable slinker. Gollum! I'll give him gollum in his throat, if ever I get my hands on his neck.'\n\n'I hope you'll never need to,' said Frodo. 'I don't know how he followed us; but it may be that he's lost us again, as you say. In this dry bleak land we can't leave many footprints, nor much scent, even for his snuffling nose.'\n\n'I hope that's the way of it,' said Sam. 'I wish we could be rid of him for good!'\n\n'So do I,' said Frodo, 'but he's not my chief trouble. I wish we could get away from these hills! I hate them. I feel all naked on the east side, stuck up here with nothing but the dead flats between me and that Shadow yonder. There's an Eye in it. Come on! We've got to get down today somehow.'\n\nBut that day wore on, and when afternoon faded towards evening they were still scrambling along the ridge and had found no way of escape.\n\nSometimes in the silence of that barren country they fancied that they heard faint sounds behind them, a stone falling, or the imagined step of flapping feet on the rock. But if they halted and stood still listening, they heard no more, nothing but the wind sighing over the edges of the stones \u0426 yet even that reminded them of breath softly hissing through sharp teeth.\n\nAll that day the outer ridge of the Emyn Muil had been bending gradually northward, as they struggled on. Along its brink there now stretched a wide tumbled flat of scored and weathered rock, cut every now and again by trench-like gullies that sloped steeply down to deep notches in the cliff-face. To find a path in these clefts, which were becoming deeper and more frequent, Frodo and Sam were driven to their left, well away from the edge, and they did not notice that for several miles they had been going slowly but steadily downhill: the cliff-top was sinking towards the level of the lowlands.\n\nAt last they were brought to a halt. The ridge took a sharper bend northward and was gashed by a deeper ravine. On the further side it reared up again, many fathoms at a single leap: a great grey cliff loomed before them, cut sheer down as if by a knife stroke. They could go no further forwards, and must turn now either west or east. But west would lead them only into more labour and delay, back towards the heart of the hills; east would take them to the outer precipice.\n\n'There's nothing for it but to scramble down this gully, Sam,' said Frodo. 'Let's see what it leads to!'\n\n'A nasty drop, I'll bet,' said Sam.\n\nThe cleft was longer and deeper than it seemed. Some way down they found a few gnarled and stunted trees, the first they had seen for days: twisted birch for the most part, with here and there a fir-tree. Many were dead and gaunt, bitten to the core by the eastern winds. Once in milder days there must have been a fair thicket in the ravine, but now, after some fifty yards, the trees came to an end, though old broken stumps straggled on almost to the cliff's brink. The bottom of the gully, which lay along the edge of a rock-fault, was rough with broken stone and slanted steeply down. When they came at last to the end of it, Frodo stooped and leaned out.\n\n'Look!' he said. 'We must have come down a long way, or else the cliff has sunk. It's much lower here than it was, and it looks easier too.'\n\nSam knelt beside him and peered reluctantly over the edge. Then he glanced up at the great cliff rising up, away on their left. 'Easier!' he grunted. 'Well, I suppose it's always easier getting down than up. Those as can't fly can jump!'\n\n'It would be a big jump still,' said Frodo. 'About, well' \u0426 he stood for a moment measuring it with his eyes \u0426 'about eighteen fathoms I should guess. Not more.'\n\n'And that's enough!' said Sam. 'Ugh! How I do hate looking down from a height! But looking's better than climbing.'\n\n'All the same,' said Frodo, 'I think we could climb here; and I think we shall have to try. See \u0426 the rock is quite different from what it was a few miles back. It has slipped and cracked.'\n\nThe outer fall was indeed no longer sheer, but sloped outwards a little. It looked like a great rampart or sea-wall whose foundations had shifted, so that its courses were all twisted and disordered, leaving great fissures and long slanting edges that were in places almost as wide as stairs.\n\n'And if we're going to try and get down, we had better try at once. It's getting dark early. I think there's a storm coming.'\n\nThe smoky blur of the mountains in the East was lost in a deeper blackness that was already reaching out westwards with long arms. There was a distant mutter of thunder borne on the rising breeze. Frodo sniffed the air and looked up doubtfully at the sky. He strapped his belt outside his cloak and tightened it, and settled his light pack on his back; then he stepped towards the edge. 'I'm going to try it,' he said.\n\n'Very good!' said Sam gloomily. 'But I'm going first.'\n\n'You?' said Frodo. 'What's made you change your mind about climbing?'\n\n'I haven't changed my mind. But it's only sense: put the one lowest as is most likely to slip. I don't want to come down atop of you and knock you off no sense in killing two with one fall.'\n\nBefore Frodo could stop him, he sat down, swung his legs over the brink, and twisted round, scrabbling with his toes for a foothold. It is doubtful if he ever did anything braver in cold blood, or more unwise.\n\n'No, no! Sam, you old ass!' said Frodo. 'You'll kill yourself for certain going over like that without even a look to see what to make for. Come back!' He took Sam under the armpits and hauled him up again. 'Now, wait a bit and be patient!' he said. Then he lay on the ground, leaning out and looking down: but the light seemed to be fading quickly, although the sun had not yet set. 'I think we could manage this,' he said presently. 'I could at any rate; and you could too. if you kept your head and followed me carefully.'\n\n'I don't know how you can be so sure,' said Sam. 'Why! You can't see to the bottom in this light. What if you comes to a place where there's nowhere to put your feet or your hands?'\n\n'Climb back, I suppose,' said Frodo.\n\n'Easy said,' objected Sam. 'Better wait till morning and more light.'\n\n'No! Not if I can help it,' said Frodo with a sudden strange vehemence. 'I grudge every hour, every minute. I'm going down to try it out. Don't you follow till I come back or call!'\n\nGripping the stony lip of the fall with his fingers he let himself gently down, until when his arms were almost at full stretch, his toes found a ledge. 'One step down!' he said. 'And this ledge broadens out to the right. I could stand there without a hold. I'll\u0426' his words were cut short.\n\nThe hurrying darkness, now gathering great speed, rushed up from the East and swallowed the sky. There was a dry splitting crack of thunder right overhead. Searing lightning smote down into the hills. Then came a blast of savage wind, and with it, mingling with its roar, there came a high shrill shriek. The hobbits had heard just such a cry far away in the Marish as they fled from Hobbiton, and even there in the woods of the Shire it had frozen their blood. Out here in the waste its terror was far greater: it pierced them with cold blades of horror and despair, stopping heart and breath. Sam fell flat on his face. Involuntarily Frodo loosed his hold and put his hands over his head and ears. He swayed, slipped, and slithered downwards with a wailing cry.\n\nSam heard him and crawled with an effort to the edge. 'Master, master!' he called. 'Master!'.\n\nHe heard no answer. He found he was shaking all over, but he gathered his breath, and once again he shouted: 'Master!' The wind seemed to blow his voice back into his throat, but as it passed, roaring up the gully and away over the hills, a faint answering cry came to his ears:\n\n'All right, all right! I'm here. But I can't see.'\n\nFrodo was calling with a weak voice. He was not actually very far away. He had slid and not fallen, and had come up with a jolt to his feet on a wider ledge not many yards lower down. Fortunately the rock-face at this point leaned well back and the wind had pressed him against the cliff, so that he had not toppled over. He steadied himself a little, laying his face against the cold stone, feeling his heart pounding. But either the darkness had grown complete, or else his eyes had lost their sight. All was black about him. He wondered if he had been struck blind. He took a deep breath.\n\n'Come back! Come back!' he heard Sam's voice out of the blackness above.\n\n'I can't,' he said. 'I can't see. I can't find any hold. I can't move yet.'\n\n'What can I do, Mr. Frodo? What can I do?' shouted Sam, leaning out dangerously far. Why could not his master see? It was dim, certainly, but not as dark as all that. He could see Frodo below him, a grey forlorn figure splayed against the cliff. But he was far out of the reach of any helping hand.\n\nThere was another crack of thunder; and then the rain came. In a blinding sheet, mingled with hail, it drove against the cliff, bitter cold.\n\n'I'm coming down to you,' shouted Sam, though how he hoped to help in that way he could not have said.\n\n'No, no! wait!' Frodo called back, more strongly now. 'I shall be better soon. I feel better already. Wait! You can't do anything without a rope.'\n\n'Rope!' cried Sam, talking wildly to himself in his excitement and relief. 'Well, if I don't deserve to be hung on the end of one as a warning to numbskulls! You're nowt but a ninnyhammer, Sam Gamgee: that's what the Gaffer said to me often enough, it being a word of his. Rope!'\n\n'Stop chattering!' cried Frodo, now recovered enough to feel both amused and annoyed. 'Never mind your Gaffer! Are you trying to tell yourself you've got some rope in your pocket? If so, out with it!\n\n'Yes, Mr. Frodo, in my pack and all. Carried it hundreds of miles and I'd clean forgotten it!'\n\n'Then get busy and let an end down!'\n\nQuickly Sam unslung his pack and rummaged in it. There indeed at the bottom was a coil of the silken-grey rope made by the folk of Lorien. He cast an end to his master. The darkness seemed to lift from Frodo's eyes, or else his sight was returning. He could see the grey line as it came dangling down, and he thought it had a faint silver sheen. Now that he had some point in the darkness to fix his eyes on, he felt less giddy. Leaning his weight forward, he made the end fast round his waist, and then he grasped the line with both hands.\n\nSam stepped back and braced his feet against a stump a yard or two from the edge. Half hauled, half scrambling, Frodo came up and threw himself on the ground.\n\nThunder growled and rumbled in the distance, and the rain was still falling heavily. The hobbits crawled away back into the gully; but they did not find much shelter there. Rills of water began to run down; soon they grew to a spate that splashed and fumed on the stones, and spouted out over the cliff like the gutters of a vast roof.\n\n'I should have been half drowned down there, or washed clean off,' said Frodo. 'What a piece of luck you had that rope!'\n\n'Better luck if I'd thought of it sooner,' said Sam. 'Maybe you remember them putting the ropes in the boats, as we started off: in the elvish country. I took a fancy to it, and I stowed a coil in my pack. Years ago, it seems. \"It may be a help in many needs,\" he said: Haldir, or one of those folk. And he spoke right.'\n\n'A pity I didn't think of bringing another length,' said Frodo, 'but I left the Company in such a hurry and confusion. If only we had enough we could use it to get down. How long is your rope, I wonder?'\n\nSam paid it out slowly, measuring it with his arms: 'Five, ten, twenty, thirty ells, more or less,' he said.\n\n'Who'd have thought it!' Frodo exclaimed.\n\n'Ah! Who would?' said Sam. 'Elves are wonderful folk. It looks a bit thin, but it's tough; and soft as milk to the hand. Packs close too, and as light as light. Wonderful folk to be sure!'\n\n'Thirty ells!' said Frodo considering. 'I believe it would be enough. If the storm passes before nightfall, I'm going to try it.'\n\n'The rain's nearly given over already,' said Sam; 'but don't you go doing anything risky in the dim again, Mr. Frodo! And I haven't got over that shriek on the wind yet, if you have. Like a Black Rider it sounded \u0426 but one up in the air, if they can fly. I'm thinking we'd best lay up in this crack till night's over.'\n\n'And I'm thinking that I won't spend a moment longer than I need stuck up on this edge with the eyes of the Dark Country looking over the marshes,' said Frodo.\n\nWith that he stood up and went down to the bottom of the gully again. He looked out. Clear sky was growing in the East once more. The skirts of the storm were lifting, ragged and wet, and the main battle had passed to spread its great wings over the Emyn Muil; upon which the dark thought of Sauron brooded for a while. Thence it turned, smiting the Vale of Anduin with hail and lightning, and casting its shadow upon Minas Tirith with threat of war. Then, lowering in the mountains, and gathering its great spires, it rolled on slowly over Gondor and the skirts of Rohan, until far away the Riders on the plain saw its black towers moving behind the sun, as they rode into the West. But here, over the desert and the reeking marshes the deep blue sky of evening opened once more, and a few pallid stars appeared, like small white holes in the canopy above the crescent moon.\n\n'It's good to be able to see again,' said Frodo, breathing deep. 'Do you know, I thought for a bit that I had lost my sight? From the lightning or something else worse. I could see nothing, nothing at all, until the grey rope came down. It seemed to shimmer somehow.'\n\n'It does look sort of silver in the dark,' said Sam. 'Never noticed it before, though I can't remember as I've ever had it out since I first stowed it. But if you're so set on climbing, Mr. Frodo, how are you going to use it? Thirty ells, or say, about eighteen fathom: that's no more than your guess at the height of the cliff.'\n\nFrodo thought for a while. 'Make it fast to that stump, Sam!' he said. 'Then I think you shall have your wish this time and go first. I'll lower you, and you need do no more than use your feet and hands to fend yourself off the rock. Though, if you put your weight on some of the ledges and give me a rest, it will help. When you're down, I'll follow. I feel quite myself again now.'\n\n'Very well,' said Sam heavily. 'If it must be, let's get it over!' He took up the rope and made it fast over the stump nearest to the brink; then the other end he tied about his own waist. Reluctantly he turned and prepared to go over the edge a second time.\n\nIt did not, however, turn out half as bad as he had expected. The rope seemed to give him confidence, though he shut his eyes more than once when he looked down between his feet. There was one awkward spot, where there was no ledge and the wall was sheer and even undercut for a short space; there he slipped and swung out on the silver line. But Frodo lowered him slowly and steadily, and it was over at last. His chief fear had been that the rope-length would give out while he was still high up, but there was still a good bight in Frodo's hands, when Sam came to the bottom and called up: 'I'm down!' His voice came up clearly from below, but Frodo could not see him; his grey elven-cloak had melted into the twilight.\n\nFrodo took rather more time to follow him. He had the rope about his waist and it was fast above, and he had shortened it so that it would pull him up before he reached the ground; still he did not want to risk a fall, and he had not quite Sam's faith in this slender grey line. He found two places, all the same, where he had to trust wholly to it: smooth surfaces where there was no hold even for his strong hobbit fingers and the ledges were far apart. But at last he too was down.\n\n'Well!' he cried. 'We've done it! We've escaped from the Emyn Muil! And now what next, I wonder? Maybe we shall soon be sighing for good hard rock under foot again.'\n\nBut Sam did not answer: he was staring back up the cliff. 'Ninnyhammers!' he said. 'Noodles! My beautiful rope! There it is tied to a stump, and we're at the bottom. Just as nice a little stair for that slinking Gollum as we could leave. Better put up a signpost to say which way we've gone! I thought it seemed a bit too easy.'\n\n'If you can think of any way we could have both used the rope and yet brought it down with us, then you can pass on to me ninnyhammer, or any other name your Gaffer gave you,' said Frodo. 'Climb up and untie it and let yourself down, if you want to!'\n\nSam scratched his head. 'No, I can't think how, begging your pardon,' he said. 'But I don't like leaving it, and that's a fact.' He stroked the rope's end and shook it gently. 'It goes hard parting with anything I brought out of the Elf-country. Made by Galadriel herself, too, maybe. Galadriel,' he murmured nodding his head mournfully. He looked up and gave one last pull to the rope as if in farewell.\n\nTo the complete surprise of both the hobbits it came loose. Sam fell over, and the long grey coils slithered silently down on top of him. Frodo laughed. 'Who tied the rope?' he said. 'A good thing it held as long as it did! To think that I trusted all my weight to your knot!'\n\nSam did not laugh. 'I may not be much good at climbing, Mr. Frodo,' he said in injured tones, 'but I do know something about rope and about knots. It's in the family, as you might say. Why, my grand-dad, and my uncle Andy after him, him that was the Gaffer's eldest brother he had a rope-walk over by Tighfield many a year. And I put as fast a hitch over the stump as any one could have done, in the Shire or out of it.'\n\n'Then the rope must have broken \u0426 frayed on the rock-edge, I expect,' said Frodo.\n\n'I bet it didn't!' said Sam in an even more injured voice. He stooped and examined the ends. 'Nor it hasn't neither. Not a strand!'\n\n'Then I'm afraid it must have been the knot,' said Frodo.\n\nSam shook his head and did not answer. He was passing the rope through his fingers thoughtfully. 'Have it your own way, Mr. Frodo,' he said at last, 'but I think the rope came off itself \u0426 when I called.' He coiled it up and stowed it lovingly in his pack.\n\n'It certainly came,' said Frodo, 'and that's the chief thing. But now we've got to think of our next move. Night will be on us soon. How beautiful the stars are, and the Moon!'\n\n'They do cheer the heart, don't they?' said Sam looking up. 'Elvish they are. somehow. And the Moon's growing. We haven't seen him for a night or two in this cloudy weather. He's beginning to give quite a light.'\n\n'Yes,' said Frodo, 'but he won't be full for some days. I don't think we'll try the marshes by the light of half a moon.'\n\nUnder the first shadows of night they started out on the next stage of their journey. After a while Sam turned and looked back at the way they had come. The mouth of the gully was a black notch in the dim cliff. 'I'm glad we've got the rope,' he said. 'We've set a little puzzle for that footpad, anyhow. He can try his nasty flappy feet on those ledges!'\n\nThey picked their steps away from the skirts of the cliff, among a wilderness of boulders and rough stones, wet and slippery with the heavy rain. The ground still fell away sharply. They had not gone very far when they came upon a great fissure that yawned suddenly black before their feet. It was not wide, but it was too wide to jump across in the dim light. They thought they could hear water gurgling in its depths. It curved away on their left northward, back towards the hills, and so barred their road in that direction, at any rate while darkness lasted.\n\n'We had better try a way back southwards along the line of the cliff, I think,' said Sam. 'We might find some nook there, or even a cave or something.'\n\n'I suppose so,' said Frodo. 'I'm tired, and I don't think I can scramble among stones much longer tonight \u0426 though I grudge the delay. I wish there was a clear path in front of us: then I'd go on till my legs gave way.'\n\nThey did not find the going any easier at the broken feet of the Emyn Muil. Nor did Sam find any nook or hollow to shelter in: only bare stony slopes frowned over by the cliff, which now rose again, higher and more sheer as they went back. In the end, worn out, they just cast themselves on the ground under the lee of a boulder lying not far from the foot of the precipice. There for some time they sat huddled mournfully together in the cold stony night, while sleep crept upon them in spite of all they could do to hold it off. The moon now rode high and clear. Its thin white light lit up the faces of the rocks and drenched the cold frowning walls of the cliff, turning all the wide looming darkness into a chill pale grey scored with black shadows.\n\n'Well!' said Frodo, standing up and drawing his cloak more closely round him. 'You sleep for a bit Sam and take my blanket. I'll walk up and down on sentry for a while.' Suddenly he stiffened, and stooping he gripped Sam by the arm. 'What's that?' he whispered. 'Look over there on the cliff!'\n\nSam looked and breathed in sharply through his teeth. 'Ssss!' he said. 'That's what it is. It's that Gollum! Snakes and ladders! And to think that I thought that we'd puzzle him with our bit of a climb! Look at him! Like a nasty crawling spider on a wall.'\n\nDown the face of a precipice, sheer and almost smooth it seemed in the pale moonlight, a small black shape was moving with its thin limbs splayed out. Maybe its soft clinging hands and toes were finding crevices and holds that no hobbit could ever have seen or used, but it looked as if it was just creeping down on sticky pads, like some large prowling thing of insect-kind. And it was coming down head first, as if it was smelling its way. Now and again it lifted its head slowly, turning it right back on its long skinny neck, and the hobbits caught a glimpse of two small pale gleaming lights, its eyes that blinked at the moon for a moment and then were quickly lidded again.\n\n'Do you think he can see us?' said Sam.\n\n'I don't know,' said Frodo quietly, 'but I think not. It is hard even for friendly eyes to see these elven-cloaks: I cannot see you in the shadow even at a few paces. And I've heard that he doesn't like Sun or Moon.'\n\n'Then why is he coming down just here?' asked Sam.\n\n'Quietly, Sam!' said Frodo. 'He can smell us, perhaps. And he can hear as keen as Elves, I believe. I think he has heard something now: our voices probably. We did a lot of shouting away back there; and we were talking far too loudly until a minute ago.'\n\n'Well, I'm sick of him,' said Sam. 'He's come once too often for me and I'm going to have a word with him, if I can. I don't suppose we could give him the slip now anyway.' Drawing his grey hood well over his face, Sam crept stealthily towards the cliff.\n\n'Careful!' whispered Frodo coming behind. 'Don't alarm him! He's much more dangerous than he looks.'\n\nThe black crawling shape was now three-quarters of the way down, and perhaps fifty feet or less above the cliff's foot. Crouching stone-still in the shadow of a large boulder the hobbits watched him. He seemed to have come to a difficult passage or to be troubled about something. They could hear him snuffling, and now and again there was a harsh hiss of breath that sounded like a curse. He lifted his head, and they thought they heard him spit. Then he moved on again. Now they could hear his voice creaking and whistling.\n\n'Ach, sss! Cautious, my precious! More haste less speed. We musstn't rissk our neck, musst we, precious? No, precious \u0426 gollum!' He lifted his head again, blinked at the moon, and quickly shut his eyes. 'We hate it,' he hissed. 'Nassty, nassty shivery light it is \u0426 sss \u0426 it spies on us, precious \u0426 it hurts our eyes.'\n\nHe was getting lower now and the hisses became sharper and clearer. 'Where iss it, where iss it: my Precious, my Precious? It's ours, it is, and we wants it. The thieves, the thieves, the filthy little thieves. Where are they with my Precious? Curse them! We hates them.'\n\n'It doesn't sound as if he knew we were here, does it?' whispered Sam. 'And what's his Precious? Does he mean the-'\n\n'Hsh!' breathed Frodo. 'He's getting near now, near enough to hear a whisper.'\n\nIndeed Gollum had suddenly paused again, and his large head on its scrawny neck was lolling from side to side as if he was listening. His pale eyes were half unlidded. Sam restrained himself, though his fingers were twitching. His eyes, filled with anger and disgust, were fixed on the wretched creature as he now began to move again, still whispering and hissing to himself.\n\nAt last he was no more than a dozen feet from the ground, right above their heads. From that point there was a sheer drop, for the cliff was slightly undercut, and even Gollum could not find a hold of any kind. He seemed to be trying to twist round, so as to go legs first, when suddenly with a shrill whistling shriek he fell. As he did so, he curled his legs and arms up round him, like a spider whose descending thread is snapped.\n\nSam was out of his hiding in a flash and crossed the space between him and the cliff foot in a couple of leaps. Before Gollum could get up, he was on top of him. But he found Gollum more than he bargained for, even taken like that, suddenly, off his guard after a fall. Before Sam could get a hold, long legs and arms were wound round him pinning his arms, and a clinging grip, soft but horribly strong, was squeezing him like slowly tightening cords; clammy fingers were feeling for his throat. Then sharp teeth bit into his shoulder. All he could do was to butt his hard round head sideways into the creature's face. Gollum hissed and spat, but he did not let go.\n\nThings would have gone ill with Sam, if he had been alone. But Frodo sprang up, and drew Sting from its sheath. With his left hand he drew back Gollum's head by his thin lank hair, stretching his long neck, and forcing his pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky.\n\n'Let go! Gollum,' he said. 'This is Sting. You have seen it before once upon a time. Let go, or you'll feel it this time! I'll cut your throat.'\n\nGollum collapsed and went as loose as wet string. Sam got up, fingering his shoulder. His eyes smouldered with anger, but he could not avenge himself: his miserable enemy lay grovelling on the stones whimpering.\n\n'Don't hurt us! Don't let them hurt us, precious! They won't hurt us will they, nice little hobbitses? We didn't mean no harm, but they jumps on us like cats on poor mices, they did, precious. And we're so lonely, gollum. We'll be nice to them, very nice, if they'll be nice to us, won't we, yes, yess.'\n\n'Well, what's to be done with it?' said Sam. 'Tie it up, so as it can't come sneaking after us no more, I say.'\n\n'But that would kill us, kill us,' whimpered Gollum. 'Cruel little hobbitses. Tie us up in the cold hard lands and leave us, gollum, gollum.' Sobs welled up in his gobbling throat.\n\n'No,' said Frodo. 'If we kill him, we must kill him outright. But we can't do that, not as things are. Poor wretch! He has done us no harm.'\n\n'Oh hasn't he!' said Sam rubbing his shoulder. 'Anyway he meant to, and he means to, I'll warrant. Throttle us in our sleep, that's his plan.'\n\n'I daresay,' said Frodo. 'But what he means to do is another matter.' He paused for a while in thought. Gollum lay still, but stopped whimpering. Sam stood glowering over him.\n\nIt seemed to Frodo then that he heard, quite plainly but far off, voices out of the past:\n\nWhat a pity Bilbo did not stub the vile creature, when he had a chance!\n\nPity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike without need.\n\nI do not feel any pity for Gollum. He deserves death.\n\nDeserves death! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some die that deserve life. Can you give that to them? Then be not too eager to deal out death in the name of justice, fearing for your own safety. Even the wise cannot see all ends.\n\n'Very well,' he answered aloud, lowering his sword. 'But still I am afraid. And yet, as you see, I will not touch the creature. For now that I see him, I do pity him.'\n\nSam stared at his master, who seemed to be speaking to some one who was not there. Gollum lifted his head.\n\n'Yess, wretched we are, precious,' he whined. 'Misery misery! Hobbits won't kill us, nice hobbits.'\n\n'No, we won't,' said Frodo. 'But we won't let you go, either. You're full of wickedness and mischief, Gollum. You will have to come with us, that's all, while we keep an eye on you. But you must help us, if you can. One good turn deserves another.'\n\n'Yess, yes indeed,' said Gollum sitting up. 'Nice hobbits! We will come with them. Find them safe paths in the dark, yes we will. And where are they going in these cold hard lands, we wonders, yes we wonders?' He looked up at them, and a faint light of cunning and eagerness flickered for a second in his pale blinking eyes.\n\nSam scowled at him, and sucked his teeth; but he seemed to sense that there was something odd about his master's mood and that the matter was beyond argument. All the same he was amazed at Frodo's reply.\n\nFrodo looked straight into Gollum's eyes which flinched and twisted away. 'You know that, or you guess well enough, Smeagol,' he said quietly and sternly. 'We are going to Mordor, of course. And you know the way there, I believe.'\n\n'Ach! sss!' said Gollum, covering his ears with his hands, as if such frankness, and the open speaking of the names, hurt him. 'We guessed, yes we guessed,' he whispered; 'and we didn't want them to go, did we? No, precious, not the nice hobbits. Ashes, ashes, and dust, and thirst there is; and pits, pits, pits, and Orcs, thousands of Orcses. Nice hobbits mustn't go to \u0426 sss \u0426 those places.'\n\n'So you have been there?' Frodo insisted. 'And you're being drawn back there, aren't you?'\n\n'Yess. Yess. No!' shrieked Gollum. 'Once, by accident it was, wasn't it, precious? Yes, by accident. But we won't go back, no, no!' Then suddenly his voice and language changed, and he sobbed in his throat, and spoke but not to them. 'Leave me alone, gollum! You hurt me. O my poor hands, gollum! I, we, I don't want to come back. I can't find it. I am tired. I, we can't find it, gollum, gollum, no, nowhere. They're always awake. Dwarves, Men, and Elves, terrible Elves with bright eyes. I can't find it. Ach!' He got up and clenched his long hand into a bony fleshless knot, shaking it towards the East. 'We won't!' he cried. 'Not for you.' Then he collapsed again. 'Gollum, gollum,' he whimpered with his face to the ground. 'Don't look at us! Go away! Go to sleep!'\n\n'He will not go away or go to sleep at your command, Smeagol,' said Frodo. 'But if you really wish to be free of him again. then you must help me. And that I fear means finding us a path towards him. But you need not go all the way, not beyond the gates of his land.'\n\nGollum sat up again and looked at him under his eyelids. 'He's over there,' he cackled. 'Always there. Orcs will take you all the way. Easy to find Orcs east of the River. Don't ask Smeagol. Poor, poor Smeagol, he went away long ago. They took his Precious, and he's lost now.'\n\n'Perhaps we'll find him again, if you come with us,' said Frodo.\n\n'No, no, never! He's lost his Precious,' said Gollum.\n\n'Get up!' said Frodo.\n\nGollum stood up and backed away against the cliff.\n\n'Now!' said Frodo. 'Can you find a path easier by day or by night? We're tired; but if you choose the night, we'll start tonight.'\n\n'The big lights hurt our eyes, they do,' Gollum whined. 'Not under the White Face, not yet. It will go behind the hills soon, yess. Rest a bit first, nice hobbits!'\n\n'Then sit down,' said Frodo, 'and don't move!'\n\nThe hobbits seated themselves beside him, one on either side. with their backs to the stony wall, resting their legs. There was no need for any arrangement by word: they knew that they must not sleep for a moment. Slowly the moon went by. Shadows fell down from the hills, and all grew dark before them. The stars grew thick and bright in the sky above. No one stirred. Gollum sat with his legs drawn up, knees under chin, flat hands and feet splayed on the ground, his eyes closed; but he seemed tense, as if thinking or listening.\n\nFrodo looked across at Sam. Their eyes met and they understood. They relaxed, leaning their heads back, and shutting their eyes or seeming to. Soon the sound of their soft breathing could be heard. Gollum's hands twitched a little. Hardly perceptibly his head moved to the left and the right, and first one eye and then the other opened a slit. The hobbits made no sign.\n\nSuddenly, with startling agility and speed, straight off the ground with a jump like a grasshopper or a frog, Gollum bounded forward into the darkness. But that was just what Frodo and Sam had expected. Sam was on him before he had gone two paces after his spring. Frodo coming behind grabbed his leg and threw him.\n\n'Your rope might prove useful again, Sam,' he said.\n\nSam got out the rope. 'And where were you off to in the cold hard lands, Mr. Gollum?' he growled. 'We wonders, aye, we wonders. To find some of your orc-friends, I warrant. You nasty treacherous creature. It's round your neck this rope ought to go, and a tight noose too.'\n\nGollum lay quiet and tried no further tricks. He did not answer Sam, but gave him a swift venomous look.\n\n'All we need is something to keep a hold on him,' said Frodo. 'We want him to walk, so it's no good tying his legs \u0426 or his arms. He seems to use them nearly as much. Tie one end to his ankle, and keep a grip on the other end.'\n\nHe stood over Gollum, while Sam tied the knot. The result surprised them both. Gollum began to scream, a thin, tearing sound, very horrible to hear. He writhed, and tried to get his mouth to his ankle and bite the rope. He kept on screaming.\n\nAt last Frodo was convinced that he really was in pain; but it could not be from the knot. He examined it and found that it was not too tight, indeed hardly tight enough. Sam was gentler than his words. 'What's the matter with you?' he said. 'If you will try to run away, you must be tied; but we don't wish to hurt you.'\n\n'It hurts us, it hurts us,' hissed Gollum. 'It freezes, it bites! Elves twisted it, curse them! Nasty cruel hobbits! That's why we tries to escape, of course it is, precious. We guessed they were cruel hobbits. They visits Elves, fierce Elves with bright eyes. Take it off us! It hurts us.'\n\n'No, I will not take it off you,' said Frodo, 'not unless' \u0426 he paused a moment in thought \u0426 'not unless there is any promise you can make that I can trust.'\n\n'We will swear to do what he wants, yes, yess,' said Gollum, still twisting and grabbling at his ankle. 'It hurts us.'\n\n'Swear?' said Frodo.\n\n'Smeagol,' said Gollum suddenly and clearly, opening his eyes wide and staring at Frodo with a strange light. 'Smeagol will swear on the Precious.'\n\nFrodo drew himself up, and again Sam was startled by his words and his stern voice. 'On the Precious? How dare you?' he said. 'Think!\n\n\t\tOne Ring to rule them all and in the Darkness bind them.\n\nWould you commit your promise to that, Smeagol? It will hold you. But it is more treacherous than you are. It may twist your words. Beware!'\n\nGollum cowered. 'On the Precious, on the Precious!' he repeated.\n\n'And what would you swear?' asked Frodo.\n\n'To be very very good,' said Gollum. Then crawling to Frodo's feet he grovelled before him, whispering hoarsely: a shudder ran over him, as if the words shook his very bones with fear. 'Smeagol will swear never, never, to let Him have it. Never! Smeagol will save it. But he must swear on the Precious.'\n\n'No! not on it,' said Frodo, looking down at him with stern pity. 'All you wish is to see it and touch it, if you can, though you know it would drive you mad. Not on it. Swear by it, if you will. For you know where it is. Yes, you know, Smeagol. It is before you.'\n\nFor a moment it appeared to Sam that his master had grown and Gollum had shrunk: a tall stern shadow, a mighty lord who hid his brightness in grey cloud, and at his feet a little whining dog. Yet the two were in some way akin and not alien: they could reach one another's minds. Gollum raised himself and began pawing at Frodo, fawning at his knees.\n\n'Down! down!' said Frodo. 'Now speak your promise!'\n\n'We promises, yes I promise!' said Gollum. 'I will serve the master of the Precious. Good master, good Smeagol, gollum, gollum!' Suddenly he began to weep and bite at his ankle again.\n\n'Take the rope off, Sam!' said Frodo.\n\nReluctantly Sam obeyed. At once Gollum got up and began prancing about, like a whipped cur whose master has patted it. From that moment a change, which lasted for some time, came over him. He spoke with less hissing and whining, and he spoke to his companions direct, not to his precious self. He would cringe and flinch, if they stepped near him or made any sudden movement, and he avoided the touch of their elven-cloaks; but he was friendly, and indeed pitifully anxious to please. He would cackle with laughter and caper, if any jest was made, or even if Frodo spoke kindly to him, and weep if Frodo rebuked him. Sam said little to him of any sort. He suspected him more deeply than ever, and if possible liked the new Gollum, the Smeagol, less than the old.\n\n'Well, Gollum, or whatever it is we're to call you,' he said, 'now for it! The Moon's gone, and the night's going. We'd better start.'\n\n'Yes, yes,' agreed Gollum, skipping about. 'Off we go! There's only one way across between the North-end and the South-end. I found it, I did. Orcs don't use it, Orcs don't know it. Orcs don't cross the Marshes, they go round for miles and miles. Very lucky you came this way. Very lucky you found Smeagol, yes. Follow Smeagol!'\n\nHe took a few steps away and looked back inquiringly, like a dog inviting them for a walk. 'Wait a bit, Gollum!' cried Sam. 'Not too far ahead now! I'm going to be at your tail, and I've got the rope handy.'\n\n'No, no!' said Gollum. 'Smeagol promised.'\n\nIn the deep of night under hard clear stars they set off. Gollum led them back northward for a while along the way they had come; then he slanted to the right away from the steep edge of the Emyn Muil, down the broken stony slopes towards the vast fens below. They faded swiftly and softly into the darkness. Over all the leagues of waste before the gates of Mordor there was a black silence.\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Passage of the Marshes\n\nGollum moved quickly, with his head and neck thrust forward, often using his hands as well as his feet. Frodo and Sam were hard put to it to keep up with him; but he seemed no longer to have any thought of escaping, and if they fell behind, he would turn and wait for them. After a time he brought them to the brink of the narrow gully that they had struck before; but they were now further from the hills.\n\n'Here it is!' he cried. 'There is a way down inside, yes. Now we follows it \u0426 out, out away over there.' He pointed south and east towards the marshes. The reek of them came to their nostrils, heavy and foul even in the cool night air.\n\nGollum cast up and down along the brink, and at length he called to them. 'Here! We can get down here. Smeagol went this way once: I went this way, hiding from Orcs.'\n\nHe led the way, and following him the hobbits climbed down into the gloom. It was not difficult, for the rift was at this point only some fifteen feet deep and about a dozen across. There was running water at the bottom: it was in fact the bed of one of the many small rivers that trickled down from the hills to feed the stagnant pools and mires beyond. Gollum turned to the right, southward more or less, and splashed along with his feet in the shallow stony stream. He seemed greatly delighted to feel the water, and chuckled to himself, sometimes even croaking in a sort of song.\n\n\t\tThe cold hard lands,\n\t\tthey bites our hands,\n\t\tthey gnaws our feet.\n\t\tThe rocks and stones\n\t\tare like old bones\n\t\tall bare of meat.\n\t\tBut stream and pool\n\t\tis wet and cool:\n\t\tso nice for feet!\n\t\tAnd now we wish \u0426\n\n'Ha! ha! What does we wish?' he said, looking sidelong at the hobbits. 'We'll tell you.' he croaked. 'He guessed it long ago, Baggins guessed it.' A glint came into his eyes, and Sam catching the gleam in the darkness thought it far from pleasant.\n\n\t\tAlive without breath;\n\t\tas cold as death;\n\t\tnever thirsting, ever drinking;\n\t\tclad in mail, never clinking.\n\t\tDrowns on dry land,\n\t\tthinks an island\n\t\tis a mountain;\n\t\tthinks a fountain\n\t\tis a puff of air.\n\t\tSo sleek, so fair!\n\t\tWhat a joy to meet!\n\t\tWe only wish\n\t\tto catch a fish,\n\t\tso juicy-sweet!\n\nThese words only made more pressing to Sam's mind a problem that had been troubling him from the moment when he understood that his master was going to adopt Gollum as a guide: the problem of food. It did not occur to him that his master might also have thought of it, but he supposed Gollum had. Indeed how had Gollum kept himself in all his lonely wandering? 'Not too well,' thought Sam. 'He looks fair famished. Not too dainty to try what hobbit tastes like if there ain't no fish, I'll wager \u0426 supposing as he could catch us napping. Well, he won't: not Sam Gamgee for one.'\n\nThey stumbled along in the dark winding gully for a long time, or so it seemed to the tired feet of Frodo and Sam. The gully turned eastward, and as they went on it broadened and got gradually shallower. At last the sky above grew faint with the first grey of morning. Gollum had shown no signs of tiring, but now he looked up and halted.\n\n'Day is near,' he whispered, as if Day was something that might overhear him and spring on him. 'Smeagol will stay here: I will stay here, and the Yellow Face won't see me.'\n\n'We should be glad to see the Sun;' said Frodo, 'but we will stay here: we are too tired to go any further at present.'\n\n'You are not wise to be glad of the Yellow Face,' said Gollum. 'It shows you up. Nice sensible hobbits stay with Smeagol. Orcs and nasty things are about. They can see a long way. Stay and hide with me!'\n\nThe three of them settled down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of the gully. It was not much more than a tall man's height now, and at its base there were wide flat shelves of dry stone; the water ran in a channel on the other side. Frodo and Sam sat on one of the flats, resting their backs. Gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stream.\n\n'We must take a little food,' said Frodo. 'Are you hungry, Smeagol? We have very little to share, but we will spare you what we can.'\n\nAt the word hungry a greenish light was kindled in Gollum's pale eyes, and they seemed to protrude further than ever from his thin sickly face. For a moment he relapsed into his old Gollum-manner. 'We are famisshed, yes famisshed we are, precious,' he said. 'What is it they eats? Have they nice fisshes?' His tongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth, licking his colourless lips.\n\n'No, we have got no fish,' said Frodo. 'We have only got this' \u0426 he held up a wafer of lembas \u0426 'and water, if the water here is fit to drink.'\n\n'Yess, yess, nice water,' said Gollum. 'Drink it, drink it, while we can! But what is it they've got, precious? Is it crunchable? Is it tasty?'\n\nFrodo broke off a portion of a wafer and handed it to him on its leaf-wrapping. Gollum sniffed at the leaf and his face changed: a spasm of disgust came over it, and a hint of his old malice. 'Smeagol smells it!' he said. 'Leaves out of the elf-country, gah! They stinks. He climbed in those trees, and he couldn't wash the smell off his hands, my nice hands.' Dropping the leaf, he took a corner of the lembas and nibbled it. He spat, and a fit of coughing shook him.\n\n'Ach! No!' he spluttered. 'You try to choke poor Smeagol. Dust and ashes, he can't eat that. He must starve. But Smeagol doesn't mind. Nice hobbits! Smeagol has promised. He will starve. He can't eat hobbits' food. He will starve. Poor thin Smeagol!'\n\n'I'm sorry,' said Frodo, 'but I can't help you, I'm afraid. I think this food would do you good, if you would try. But perhaps you can't even try, not yet anyway.'\n\nThe hobbits munched their lembas in silence. Sam thought that it tasted far better, somehow, than it had for a good while: Gollum's behaviour had made him attend to its flavour again. But he did not feel comfortable. Gollum watched every morsel from hand to mouth, like an expectant dog by a diner's chair. Only when they had finished and were preparing to rest, was he apparently convinced that they had no hidden dainties that he could share in. Then he went and sat by himself a few paces away and whimpered a little.\n\n'Look here!' Sam whispered to Frodo, not too softly: he did not really care whether Gollum heard him or not. 'We've got to get some sleep; but not both together with that hungry villain nigh, promise or no promise. Smeagol or Gollum, he won't change his habits in a hurry, I'll warrant. You go to sleep, Mr. Frodo, and I'll call you when I can't keep my eyelids propped up. Turn and about, same as before, while he's loose.'\n\n'Perhaps you're right, Sam,' said Frodo speaking openly. 'There is a change in him, but just what kind of a change and how deep, I'm not sure yet. Seriously though, I don't think there is any need for fear \u0426 at present. Still watch if you wish. Give me about two hours, not more, and then call me.'\n\nSo tired was Frodo that his head fell forward on his breast and he slept, almost as soon as he had spoken the words. Gollum seemed no longer to have any fears. He curled up and went quickly to sleep, quite unconcerned. Presently his breath was hissing softly through his clenched teeth, but he lay still as stone. After a while, fearing that he would drop off himself, if he sat listening to his two companions breathing, Sam got up and gently prodded Gollum. His hands uncurled and twitched, but he made no other movement. Sam bent down and said fissh close to his ear, but there was no response, not even a catch in Gollum's breathing.\n\nSam scratched his head. 'Must really be asleep,' he muttered. 'And if I was like Gollum, he wouldn't wake up never again.' He restrained the thoughts of his sword and the rope that sprang to his mind, and went and sat down by his master.\n\nWhen he woke up the sky above was dim, not lighter but darker than when they had breakfasted. Sam leapt to his feet. Not least from his own feeling of vigour and hunger, he suddenly understood that he had slept the daylight away, nine hours at least. Frodo was still fast asleep, lying now stretched on his side. Gollum was not to be seen. Various reproachful names for himself came to Sam's mind, drawn from the Gaffer's large paternal word-hoard; then it also occurred to him that his master had been right: there had for the present been nothing to guard against. They were at any rate both alive and unthrottled.\n\n'Poor wretch!' he said half remorsefully. 'Now I wonder where he's got to?'\n\n'Not far, not far!' said a voice above him. He looked up and saw the shape of Gollum's large head and ears against the evening sky.\n\n'Here, what are you doing?' cried Sam, his suspicions coming back as soon as he saw that shape.\n\n'Smeagol is hungry,' said Gollum. 'Be back soon.'\n\n'Come back now!' shouted Sam. 'Hi! Come back!' But Gollum had vanished.\n\nFrodo woke at the sound of Sam's shout and sat up, rubbing his eyes. 'Hullo!' he said. 'Anything wrong? What's the time?'\n\n'I dunno,' said Sam. 'After sundown, I reckon. And he's gone off. Says he's hungry.'\n\n'Don't worry!' said Frodo. 'There's no help for it. But he'll come back, you'll see. The promise will hold yet a while. And he won't leave his Precious, anyway.'\n\nFrodo made light of it when he learned that they had slept soundly for hours with Gollum, and a very hungry Gollum too, loose beside them. 'Don't think of any of your Gaffer's hard names,' he said. 'You were worn out, and it has turned out well: we are now both rested. And we have a hard road ahead, the worst road of all.'\n\n'About the food,' said Sam. 'How long's it going to take us to do this job? And when it's done, what are we going to do then? This waybread keeps you on your legs in a wonderful way, though it doesn't satisfy the innards proper, as you might say: not to my feeling anyhow, meaning no disrespect to them as made it. But you have to eat some of it every day, and it doesn't grow. I reckon we've got enough to last, say, three weeks or so, and that with a tight belt and a light tooth, mind you. We've been a bit free with it so far.'\n\n'I don't know how long we shall take to \u0426 to finish,' said Frodo. 'We were miserably delayed in the hills. But Samwise Gamgee, my dear hobbit \u0426 indeed, Sam my dearest hobbit, friend of friends \u0426 I do not think we need give thought to what comes after that. To do the job as you put it \u0426 what hope is there that we ever shall? And if we do, who knows what will come of that? If the One goes into the Fire, and we are at hand? I ask you, Sam, are we ever likely to need bread again? I think not. If we can nurse our limbs to bring us to Mount Doom, that is all we can do. More than I can, I begin to feel.'\n\nSam nodded silently. He took his master's hand and bent over it. He did not kiss it, though his tears fell on it. Then he turned away, drew his sleeve over his nose, and got up, and stamped about, trying to whistle, and saying between the efforts: 'Where's that dratted creature?'\n\nIt was actually not long before Gollum returned; but he came so quietly that they did not hear him till he stood before them. His fingers and face were soiled with black mud. He was still chewing and slavering. What he was chewing, they did not ask or like to think.\n\n'Worms or beetles or something slimy out of holes,' thought Sam. 'Brr! The nasty creature; the poor wretch!'\n\nGollum said nothing to them, until he had drunk deeply and washed himself in the stream. Then he came up to them, licking his lips. 'Better now,' he said. 'Are we rested? Ready to go on? Nice hobbits, they sleep beautifully. Trust Smeagol now? Very, very good.'\n\nThe next stage of their journey was much the same as the last. As they went on the gully became ever shallower and the slope of its floor more gradual. Its bottom was less stony and more earthy, and slowly its sides dwindled to mere banks. It began to wind and wander. That night drew to its end, but clouds were now over moon and star, and they knew of the coming of day only by the slow spreading of the thin grey light.\n\nIn a chill hour they came to the end of the water-course. The banks became moss-grown mounds. Over the last shelf of rotting stone the stream gurgled and fell down into a brown bog and was lost. Dry reeds hissed and rattled though they could feel no wind.\n\nOn either side and in front wide fens and mires now lay, stretching away southward and eastward into the dim half-light. Mists curled and smoked from dark and noisome pools. The reek of them hung stifling in the still air. Far away, now almost due south, the mountain-walls of Mordor loomed, like a black bar of rugged clouds floating above a dangerous fog-bound sea.\n\nThe hobbits were now wholly in the hands of Gollum. They did now know, and could not guess in that misty light, that they were in fact only just within the northern borders of the marshes, the main expanse of which lay south of them. They could, if they had known the lands, with some delay have retraced their steps a little, and then turning east have come round over hard roads to the bare plain of Dagorlad: the field of the ancient battle before the gates of Mordor. Not that there was great hope in such a course. On that stony plain there was no cover, and across it ran the highways of the Orcs and the soldiers of the Enemy. Not even the cloaks of Lorien would have concealed them there.\n\n'How do we shape our course now, Smeagol?' asked Frodo. 'Must we cross these evil-smelling fens?'\n\n'No need, no need at all,' said Gollum. 'Not if hobbits want to reach the dark mountains and go to see Him very quick. Back a little, and round a little' \u0426 his skinny arm waved north and east \u0426 'and you can come on hard cold roads to the very gates of His country. Lots of His people will be there looking out for guests, very pleased to take them straight to Him, O yes. His Eye watches that way all the time. It caught Smeagol there, long ago.' Gollum shuddered. 'But Smeagol has used his eyes since then, yes, yes: I've used eyes and feet and nose since then. l know other ways. More difficult, not so quick; but better, if we don't want Him to see. Follow Smeagol! He can take you through the marshes, through the mists, nice thick mists. Follow Smeagol very carefully, and you may go a long way, quite a long way, before He catches you, yes perhaps.'\n\nIt was already day, a windless and sullen morning, and the marsh-reeks lay in heavy banks. No sun pierced the low clouded sky, and Gollum seemed anxious to continue the journey at once. So after a brief rest they set out again and were soon lost in a shadowy silent world, cut off from all view of the lands about, either the hills that they had left or the mountains that they sought. They went slowly in single file: Gollum, Sam, Frodo.\n\nFrodo seemed the most weary of the three, and slow though they went, he often lagged. The hobbits soon found that what had looked like one vast fen was really an endless network of pools, and soft mires, and winding half-strangled water-courses. Among these a cunning eye and foot could thread a wandering path. Gollum certainly had that cunning, and needed all of it. His head on its long neck was ever turning this way and that, while he sniffed and muttered all the time to himself. Sometimes he would hold up his hand and halt them, while he went forward a little, crouching, testing the ground with fingers or toes, or merely listening with one ear pressed to the earth.\n\nIt was dreary and wearisome. Cold clammy winter still held sway in this forsaken country. The only green was the scum of livid weed on the dark greasy surfaces of the sullen waters. Dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed up in the mists like ragged shadows of long-forgotten summers.\n\nAs the day wore on the light increased a little, and the mists lifted, growing thinner and more transparent. Far above the rot and vapours of the world the Sun was riding high and golden now in a serene country with floors of dazzling foam, but only a passing ghost of her could they see below, bleared, pale, giving no colour and no warmth. But even at this faint reminder of her presence Gollum scowled and flinched. He halted their journey, and they rested, squatting like little hunted animals, in the borders of a great brown reed-thicket. There was a deep silence, only scraped on its surfaces by the faint quiver of empty seed-plumes, and broken grass-blades trembling in small air-movements that they could not feel.\n\n'Not a bird!' said Sam mournfully.\n\n'No, no birds,' said Gollum. 'Nice birds!' He licked his teeth. 'No birds here. There are snakeses, wormses, things in the pools. Lots of things, lots of nasty things. No birds,' he ended sadly. Sam looked at him with distaste.\n\nSo passed the third day of their journey with Gollum. Before the shadows of evening were long in happier lands, they went on again, always on and on with only brief halts. These they made not so much for rest as to help Gollum; for now even he had to go forward with great care, and he was sometimes at a loss for a while. They had come to the very midst of the Dead Marshes, and it was dark.\n\nThey walked slowly, stooping, keeping close in line, following attentively every move that Gollum made. The fens grew more wet, opening into wide stagnant meres, among which it grew more and more difficult to find the firmer places where feet could tread without sinking into gurgling mud. The travellers were light, or maybe none of them would ever have found a way through.\n\nPresently it grew altogether dark: the air itself seemed black and heavy to breathe. When lights appeared Sam rubbed his eyes: he thought his head was going queer. He first saw one with the corner of his left eye, a wisp of pale sheen that faded away; but others appeared soon after: some like dimly shining smoke, some like misty flames flickering slowly above unseen candles; here and there they twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled by hidden hands. But neither of his companions spoke a word.\n\nAt last Sam could bear it no longer. 'What's all this, Gollum?' he said in a whisper. 'These lights? They're all round us now. Are we trapped? Who are they?'\n\nGollum looked up. A dark water was before him, and he was crawling on the ground, this way and that, doubtful of the way. 'Yes, they are all round us,' he whispered. 'The tricksy lights. Candles of corpses, yes, yes. Don't you heed them! Don't look! Don't follow them! Where's the master?'\n\nSam looked back and found that Frodo had lagged again. He could not see him. He went some paces back into the darkness, not daring to move far, or to call in more than a hoarse whisper. Suddenly he stumbled against Frodo, who was standing lost in thought, looking at the pale lights. His hands hung stiff at his sides; water and slime were dripping from them.\n\n'Come, Mr. Frodo!' said Sam. 'Don't look at them! Gollum says we mustn't. Let's keep up with him and get out of this cursed place as quick as we can \u0426 if we can!'\n\n'All right,' said Frodo, as if returning out of a dream. 'I'm coming. Go on!'\n\nHurrying forward again, Sam tripped, catching his foot in some old root or tussock. He fell and came heavily on his hands, which sank deep into sticky ooze, so that his face was brought close to the surface of the dark mere. There was a faint hiss, a noisome smell went up, the lights flickered and danced and swirled. For a moment the water below him looked like some window, glazed with grimy glass, through which he was peering. Wrenching his hands out of the bog, he sprang back with a cry. 'There are dead things, dead faces in the water,' he said with horror. 'Dead faces!'\n\nGollum laughed. 'The Dead Marshes, yes, yes: that is their names,' he cackled. 'You should not look in when the candles are lit.'\n\n'Who are they? What are they?' asked Sam shuddering, turning to Frodo, who was now behind him.\n\n'I don't know,' said Frodo in a dreamlike voice. 'But I have seen them too. In the pools when the candles were lit. They lie in all the pools, pale faces, deep deep under the dark water. I saw them: grim faces and evil, and noble faces and sad. Many faces proud and fair, and weeds in their silver hair. But all foul, all rotting, all dead. A fell light is in them.' Frodo hid his eyes in his hands. 'I know not who they are; but I thought I saw there Men and Elves, and Orcs beside them.'\n\n'Yes, yes,' said Gollum. 'All dead, all rotten. Elves and Men and Orcs. The Dead Marshes. There was a great battle long ago, yes, so they told him when Smeagol was young, when I was young before the Precious came. It was a great battle. Tall Men with long swords, and terrible Elves, and Orcses shrieking. They fought on the plain for days and months at the Black Gates. But the Marshes have grown since then, swallowed up the graves; always creeping, creeping.'\n\n'But that is an age and more ago,' said Sam. 'The Dead can't be really there! Is it some devilry hatched in the Dark Land?'\n\n'Who knows? Smeagol doesn't know,' answered Gollum. 'You cannot reach them, you cannot touch them. We tried once, yes, precious, I tried once; but you cannot reach them. Only shapes to see, perhaps, not to touch. No precious! All dead.'\n\nSam looked darkly at him and shuddered again, thinking that he guessed why Smeagol had tried to touch them. 'Well, I don't want to see them,' he said. 'Never again! Can't we get on and get away?'\n\n'Yes, yes,' said Gollum. 'But slowly, very slowly. Very carefully! Or hobbits go down to join the Dead ones and light little candles. Follow Smeagol! Don't look at lights!'\n\nHe crawled away to the right, seeking for a path round the mere. They came close behind, stooping, often using their hands even as he did. 'Three precious little Gollums in a row we shall be, if this goes on much longer,' thought Sam.\n\nAt last they came to the end of the black mere, and they crossed it, perilously, crawling or hopping from one treacherous island tussock to another. Often they floundered, stepping or falling hands-first into waters as noisome as a cesspool, till they were slimed and fouled almost up to their necks and stank in one another's nostrils.\n\nIt was late in the night when at length they reached firmer ground again. Gollum hissed and whispered to himself, but it appeared that he was pleased: in some mysterious way, by some blended sense of feel, and smell, and uncanny memory for shapes in the dark, he seemed to know just where he was again, and to be sure of his road ahead.\n\n'Now on we go!' he said. 'Nice hobbits! Brave hobbits! Very very weary, of course; so we are, my precious, all of us. But we must take master away from the wicked lights, yes, yes, we must.' With these words he started off again, almost at a trot, down what appeared to be a long lane between high reeds, and they stumbled after him as quickly as they could. But in a little while he stopped suddenly and sniffed the air doubtfully, hissing as if he was troubled or displeased again.\n\n'What is it?' growled Sam, misinterpreting the signs. 'What's the need to sniff? The stink nearly knocks me down with my nose held. You stink, and master stinks; the whole place stinks.'\n\n'Yes, yes, and Sam stinks!' answered Gollum. 'Poor Smeagol smells it, but good Smeagol bears it. Helps nice master. But that's no matter. The air's moving, change is coming. Smeagol wonders; he's not happy.'\n\nHe went on again, but his uneasiness grew, and every now and again he stood up to his full height, craning his neck eastward and southward. For some time the hobbits could not hear or feel what was troubling him. Then suddenly all three halted, stiffening and listening. To Frodo and Sam it seemed that they heard, far away, a long wailing cry, high and thin and cruel. They shivered. At the same moment the stirring of the air became perceptible to them; and it grew very cold. As they stood straining their ears, they heard a noise like a wind coming in the distance. The misty lights wavered, dimmed, and went out.\n\nGollum would not move. He stood shaking and gibbering to himself, until with a rush the wind came upon them, hissing and snarling over the marshes. The night became less dark, light enough for them to see, or half see, shapeless drifts of fog, curling and twisting as it rolled over them and passed them. Looking up they saw the clouds breaking and shredding; and then high in the south the moon glimmered out, riding in the flying wrack.\n\nFor a moment the sight of it gladdened the hearts of the hobbits; but Gollum cowered down, muttering curses on the White Face. Then Frodo and Sam staring at the sky, breathing deeply of the fresher air, saw it come: a small cloud flying from the accursed hills; a black shadow loosed from Mordor; a vast shape winged and ominous. It scudded across the moon, and with a deadly cry went away westward, outrunning the wind in its fell speed.\n\nThey fell forward, grovelling heedlessly on the cold earth. But the shadow of horror wheeled and returned, passing lower now, right above them, sweeping the fen-reek with its ghastly wings. And then it was gone, flying back to Mordor with the speed of the wrath of Sauron; and behind it the wind roared away, leaving the Dead Marshes bare and bleak. The naked waste, as far as the eye could pierce, even to the distant menace of the mountains, was dappled with the fitful moonlight.\n\nFrodo and Sam got up, rubbing their eyes, like children wakened from an evil dream to find the familiar night still over the world. But Gollum lay on the ground as if he had been stunned. They roused him with difficulty, and for some time he would not lift his face, but knelt forward on his elbows, covering the back of his head with his large flat hands.\n\n'Wraiths!' he wailed. 'Wraiths on wings! The Precious is their master. They see everything, everything. Nothing can hide from them. Curse the White Face! And they tell Him everything. He sees, He knows. Ach, gollum, gollum, gollum!' It was not until the moon had sunk, westering far beyond Tol Brandir, that he would get up or make a move.\n\nFrom that time on Sam thought that he sensed a change in Gollum again. He was more fawning and would-be friendly; but Sam surprised some strange looks in his eyes at times, especially towards Frodo; and he went back more and more into his old manner of speaking. And Sam had another growing anxiety. Frodo seemed to be weary, weary to the point of exhaustion. He said nothing, indeed he hardly spoke at all; and he did not complain, but he walked like one who carries a load, the weight of which is ever increasing; and he dragged along, slower and slower, so that Sam had often to beg Gollum to wait and not to leave their master behind.\n\nIn fact with every step towards the gates of Mordor Frodo felt the Ring on its chain about his neck grow more burdensome. He was now beginning to feel it as an actual weight dragging him earthwards. But far more he was troubled by the Eye: so he called it to himself. It was that more than the drag of the Ring that made him cower and stoop as he walked. The Eye: that horrible growing sense of a hostile will that strove with great power to pierce all shadows of cloud, and earth, and flesh, and to see you: to pin you under its deadly gaze, naked, immovable. So thin, so frail and thin, the veils were become that still warded it off. Frodo knew just where the present habitation and heart of that will now was: as certainly as a man can tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut. He was facing it, and its potency beat upon his brow.\n\nGollum probably felt something of the same sort. But what went on in his wretched heart between the pressure of the Eye, and the lust of the Ring that was so near, and his grovelling promise made half in the fear of cold iron, the hobbits did not guess: Frodo gave no thought to it. Sam's mind was occupied mostly with his master hardly noticing the dark cloud that had fallen on his own heart. He put Frodo in front of him now, and kept a watchful eye on every movement of his, supporting him if he stumbled, and trying to encourage him with clumsy words.\n\nWhen day came at last the hobbits were surprised to see how much closer the ominous mountains had already drawn. The air was now clearer and colder, and though still far off, the walls of Mordor were no longer a cloudy menace on the edge of sight, but as grim black towers they frowned across a dismal waste. The marshes were at an end, dying away into dead peats and wide flats of dry cracked mud. The land ahead rose in long shallow slopes, barren and pitiless, towards the desert that lay at Sauron's gate.\n\nWhile the grey light lasted, they cowered under a black stone like worms, shrinking, lest the winged terror should pass and spy them with its cruel eyes. The remainder of that journey was a shadow of growing fear in which memory could find nothing to rest upon. For two more nights they struggled on through the weary pathless land. The air, as it seemed to them, grew harsh, and filled with a bitter reek that caught their breath and parched their mouths.\n\nAt last, on the fifth morning since they took the road with Gollum, they halted once more. Before them dark in the dawn the great mountains reached up to roofs of smoke and cloud. Out from their feet were flung huge buttresses and broken hills that were now at the nearest scarce a dozen miles away. Frodo looked round in horror. Dreadful as the Dead Marshes had been, and the arid moors of the Noman-lands, more loathsome far was the country that the crawling day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes. Even to the Mere of Dead Faces some haggard phantom of green spring would come; but here neither spring nor summer would ever come again. Here nothing lived, not even the leprous growths that feed on rottenness. The gasping pools were choked with ash and crawling muds, sickly white and grey, as if the mountains had vomited the filth of their entrails upon the lands about. High mounds of crushed and powdered rock, great cones of earth fire-blasted and poison-stained, stood like an obscene graveyard in endless rows, slowly revealed in the reluctant light.\n\nThey had come to the desolation that lay before Mordor: the lasting monument to the dark labour of its slaves that should endure when all their purposes were made void; a land defiled, diseased beyond all healing \u0426 unless the Great Sea should enter in and wash it with oblivion. 'I feel sick,' said Sam. Frodo did not speak.\n\nFor a while they stood there, like men on the edge of a sleep where nightmare lurks, holding it off, though they know that they can only come to morning through the shadows. The light broadened and hardened. The gasping pits and poisonous mounds grew hideously clear. The sun was up, walking among clouds and long flags of smoke, but even the sunlight was defiled. The hobbits had no welcome for that light; unfriendly it seemed, revealing them in their helplessness \u0426 little squeaking ghosts that wandered among the ash-heaps of the Dark Lord.\n\nToo weary to go further they sought for some place where they could rest. For a while they sat without speaking under the shadow of a mound of slag; but foul fumes leaked out of it, catching their throats and choking them. Gollum was the first to get up. Spluttering and cursing he rose, and without a word or a glance at the hobbits he crawled away on all fours. Frodo and Sam crawled after him, until they came to a wide almost circular pit, high-banked upon the west. It was cold and dead, and a foul sump of oily many-coloured ooze lay at its bottom. In this evil hole they cowered, hoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the Eye.\n\nThe day passed slowly. A great thirst troubled them, but they drank only a few drops from their bottles \u0426 last filled in the gully, which now as they looked back in thought seemed to them a place of peace and beauty. The hobbits took it in turn to watch. At first, tired as they were, neither of them could sleep at all; but as the sun far away was climbing down into slow moving cloud, Sam dozed. It was Frodo's turn to be on guard. He lay back on the slope of the pit, but that did not ease the sense of burden that was on him. He looked up at the smoke-streaked sky and saw strange phantoms, dark riding shapes, and faces out of the past. He lost count of time, hovering between sleep and waking, until forgetfulness came over him.\n\nSuddenly Sam woke up thinking that he heard his master calling. It was evening. Frodo could not have called, for he had fallen asleep, and had slid down nearly to the bottom of the pit. Gollum was by him. For a moment Sam thought that he was trying to rouse Frodo; then he saw that it was not so. Gollum was talking to himself. Smeagol was holding a debate with some other thought that used the same voice but made it squeak and hiss. A pale light and a green light alternated in his eyes as he spoke.\n\n'Smeagol promised,' said the first thought.\n\n'Yes, yes, my precious,' came the answer, 'we promised: to save our Precious, not to let Him have it \u0426 never. But it's going to Him yes, nearer every step. What's the hobbit going to do with it, we wonders, yes we wonders.'\n\n'I don't know. I can't help it. Master's got it. Smeagol promised to help the master.'\n\n'Yes, yes, to help the master: the master of the Precious. But if we was master, then we could help ourselfs, yes, and still keep promises.'\n\n'But Smeagol said he would be very very good. Nice hobbit! He took cruel rope off Smeagol's leg. He speaks nicely to me.'\n\n'Very very good, eh, my precious? Let's be good, good as fish, sweet one, but to ourselfs. Not hurt the nice hobbit, of course, no, no.'\n\n'But the Precious holds the promise,' the voice of Smeagol objected.\n\n'Then take it,' said the other, 'and let's hold it ourselfs! Then we shall be master, gollum! Make the other hobbit, the nasty suspicious hobbit, make him crawl, yes, gollum!'\n\n'But not the nice hobbit?'\n\n'Oh no, not if it doesn't please us. Still he's a Baggins, my precious, yes, a Baggins. A Baggins stole it. He found it and he said nothing, nothing. We hates Bagginses.'\n\n'No, not this Baggins.'\n\n'Yes, every Baggins. All peoples that keep the Precious. We must have it!'\n\n'But He'll see, He'll know. He'll take it from us!'\n\n'He sees. He knows. He heard us make silly promises \u0426 against His orders, yes. Must take it. The Wraiths are searching. Must take it.'\n\n'Not for Him!'\n\n'No, sweet one. See, my precious: if we has it, then we can escape, even from Him, eh? Perhaps we grows very strong, stronger than Wraiths. Lord Smeagol? Gollum the Great? The Gollum! Eat fish every day, three times a day; fresh from the sea. Most Precious Gollum! Must have it. We wants it, we wants it, we wants it!'\n\n'But there's two of them. They'll wake too quick and kill us,' whined Smeagol in a last effort. 'Not now. Not yet.'\n\n'We wants it! But' \u0426 and here there was a long pause, as if a new thought had wakened. 'Not yet, eh? Perhaps not. She might help. She might, yes.'\n\n'No, no! Not that way!' wailed Smeagol.\n\n'Yes! We wants it! We wants it!'\n\nEach time that the second thought spoke, Gollum's long hand crept out slowly, pawing towards Frodo, and then was drawn back with a jerk as Smeagol spoke again. Finally both arms, with long fingers flexed and twitching, clawed towards his neck.\n\nSam had lain still, fascinated by this debate, but watching every move that Gollum made from under his half-closed eye-lids. To his simple mind ordinary hunger, the desire to eat hobbits, had seemed the chief danger in Gollum. He realized now that it was not so: Gollum was feeling the terrible call of the Ring. The Dark Lord was He, of course; but Sam wondered who She was. One of the nasty friends the little wretch had made in his wanderings, he supposed. Then he forgot the point, for things had plainly gone far enough, and were getting dangerous. A great heaviness was in all his limbs, but he roused himself with an effort and sat up. Something warned him to be careful and not to reveal that he had overheard the debate. He let out a loud sigh and gave a huge yawn.\n\n'What's the time?' he said sleepily.\n\nGollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth. He stood up for a moment, tense and menacing; and then he collapsed, falling forward on to all fours and crawling up the bank of the pit. 'Nice hobbits! Nice Sam!' he said. 'Sleepy heads, yes, sleepy heads! Leave good Smeagol to watch! But it's evening. Dusk is creeping. Time to go.'\n\n'High time!' thought Sam. 'And time we parted, too.' Yet it crossed his mind to wonder if indeed Gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as kept with them. 'Curse him! I wish he was choked!' he muttered. He stumbled down the bank and roused his master.\n\nStrangely enough, Frodo felt refreshed. He had been dreaming. The dark shadow had passed, and a fair vision had visited him in this land of disease. Nothing remained of it in his memory, yet because of it he felt glad and lighter of heart. His burden was less heavy on him. Gollum welcomed him with dog-like delight. He chuckled and chattered, cracking his long fingers, and pawing at Frodo's knees. Frodo smiled at him.\n\n'Come!' he said. 'You have guided us well and faithfully. This is the last stage. Bring us to the Gate, and then I will not ask you to go further. Bring us to the Gate, and you may go where you wish \u0426 only not to our enemies.'\n\n'To the Gate, eh?' Gollum squeaked, seeming surprised and frightened. 'To the Gate, master says! Yes, he says so. And good Smeagol does what he asks, O yes. But when we gets closer, we'll see perhaps we'll see then. It won't look nice at all. O no! O no!'\n\n'Go on with you!' said Sam. 'Let's get it over!'\n\nIn the falling dusk they scrambled out of the pit and slowly threaded their way through the dead land. They had not gone far before they felt once more the fear that had fallen on them when the winged shape swept over the marshes. They halted, cowering on the evil-smelling ground; but they saw nothing in the gloomy evening sky above, and soon the menace passed, high overhead, going maybe on some swift errand from Barad-dur. After a while Gollum got up and crept forward again, muttering and shaking.\n\nAbout an hour after midnight the fear fell on them a third time, but it now seemed more remote, as if it were passing far above the clouds, rushing with terrible speed into the West. Gollum, however, was helpless with terror, and was convinced that they were being hunted, that their approach was known.\n\n'Three times!' he whimpered. 'Three times is a threat. They feel us here, they feel the Precious. The Precious is their master. We cannot go any further this way, no. It's no use, no use!'\n\nPleading and kind words were no longer of any avail. It was not until Frodo commanded him angrily and laid a hand on his sword-hilt that Gollum would get up again. Then at last he rose with a snarl, and went before them like a beaten dog.\n\nSo they stumbled on through the weary end of the night, and until the coming of another day of fear they walked in silence with bowed heads, seeing nothing, and hearing nothing but the wind hissing in their ears.\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe Black Gate is Closed\n\nBefore the next day dawned their journey to Mordor was over. The marshes and the desert were behind them. Before them, darkling against a pallid sky, the great mountains reared their threatening heads.\n\nUpon the west of Mordor marched the gloomy range of Ephel Duath, the Mountains of Shadow, and upon the north the broken peaks and barren ridges of Ered Lithui, grey as ash. But as these ranges approached one another, being indeed but parts of one great wall about the mournful plains of Lithlad and of Gorgoroth, and the bitter inland sea of Nurnen amidmost, they swung out long arms northward; and between these arms there was a deep defile. This was Cirith Gorgor, the Haunted Pass, the entrance to the land of the Enemy. High cliffs lowered upon either side, and thrust forward from its mouth were two sheer hills, black-boned and bare. Upon them stood the Teeth of Mordor, two towers strong and tall. In days long past they were built by the Men of Gondor in their pride and power, after the overthrow of Sauron and his flight, lest he should seek to return to his old realm. But the strength of Gondor failed, and men slept, and for long years the towers stood empty. Then Sauron returned. Now the watch-towers, which had fallen into decay, were repaired, and filled with arms, and garrisoned with ceaseless vigilance. Stony-faced they were, with dark window-holes staring north and east and west, and each window was full of sleepless eyes.\n\nAcross the mouth of the pass, from cliff to cliff, the Dark Lord had built a rampart of stone. In it there was a single gate of iron, and upon its battlement sentinels paced unceasingly. Beneath the hills on either side the rock was bored into a hundred caves and maggot-holes: there a host of orcs lurked, ready at a signal to issue forth like black ants going to war. None could pass the Teeth of Mordor and not feel their bite, unless they were summoned by Sauron, or knew the secret passwords that would open the Morannon, the black gate of his land.\n\nThe two hobbits gazed at the towers and the wall in despair. Even from a distance they could see in the dim light the movement of the black guards upon the wall, and the patrols before the gate. They lay now peering over the edge of a rocky hollow beneath the out-stretched shadow of the northmost buttress of Ephel Duath. Winging the heavy air in a straight flight a crow, maybe, would have flown but a furlong from their hiding-place to the black summit of the nearer tower. A faint smoke curled above it, as if fire smouldered in the hill beneath.\n\nDay came, and the fallow sun blinked over the lifeless ridges of Ered Lithui. Then suddenly the cry of brazen-throated trumpets was heard: from the watch-towers they blared, and far away from hidden holds and outposts in the hills came answering calls; and further still, remote but deep and ominous, there echoed in the hollow land beyond the mighty horns and drums of Barad-dur. Another dreadful day of fear and toil had come to Mordor; and the night-guards were summoned to their dungeons and deep halls, and the day-guards, evil-eyed and fell, were marching to their posts. Steel gleamed dimly on the battlement.\n\n'Well, here we are!' said Sam. 'Here's the Gate, and it looks to me as if that's about as far as we are ever going to get. My word, but the Gaffer would have a thing or two to say, if he saw me now! Often said I'd come to a bad end, if I didn't watch my step, he did. But now I don't suppose I'll ever see the old fellow again. He'll miss his chance of I told'ee so, Sam: more's the pity. He could go on telling me as long as he'd got breath, if only I could see his old face again. But I'd have to get a wash first, or he wouldn't know me.\n\n'I suppose it's no good asking \"what way do we go now?\" We can't go no further \u0426 unless we want to ask the orcs for a lift.'\n\n'No, no!' said Gollum. 'No use. We can't go further. Smeagol said so. He said: we'll go to the Gate, and then we'll see. And we do see. O yes, my precious, we do see. Smeagol knew hobbits could not go this way. O yes, Smeagol knew.'\n\n'Then what the plague did you bring us here for?' said Sam, not feeling in the mood to be just or reasonable.\n\n'Master said so. Master says: Bring us to the Gate. So good Smeagol does so. Master said so, wise master.'\n\n'I did,' said Frodo. His face was grim and set, but resolute. He was filthy, haggard, and pinched with weariness, but he cowered no longer, and his eyes were clear. 'I said so, because I purpose to enter Mordor, and I know no other way. Therefore I shall go this way. I do not ask anyone to go with me.'\n\n'No, no, master!' wailed Gollum; pawing at him, and seeming in great distress. 'No use that way! No use! Don't take the Precious to Him! He'll eat us all, if He gets it, eat all the world. Keep it, nice master, and be kind to Smeagol. Don't let Him have it. Or go away, go to nice places, and give it back to little Smeagol. Yes, yes, master: give it back, eh? Smeagol will keep it safe; he will do lots of good, especially to nice hobbits. Hobbits go home. Don't go to the Gate!'\n\n'I am commanded to go to the land of Mordor, and therefore I shall go,' said Frodo. 'If there is only one way, then I must take it. What comes after must come.'\n\nSam said nothing. The look on Frodo's face was enough for him he knew that words of his were useless. And after all he never had any real hope in the affair from the beginning; but being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed hope, as long as despair could be postponed. Now they were come to the bitter end. But he had stuck to his master all the way; that was what he had chiefly come for, and he would still stick to him. His master would not go to Mordor alone. Sam would go with him \u0426 and at any rate they would get rid of Gollum.\n\nGollum, however, did not intend to be got rid of, yet. He knelt at Frodo's feet, wringing his hands and squeaking. 'Not this way, master!' he pleaded, 'There is another way. O yes indeed there is. Another way, darker, more difficult to find, more secret. But Smeagol knows it. Let Smeagol show you!'\n\n'Another way!' said Frodo doubtfully, looking down at Gollum with searching eyes.\n\n'Yess! Yess indeed! There was another way. Smeagol found it. Let's go and see if it's still there!'\n\n'You have not spoken of this before.'\n\n'No. Master did not ask. Master did not say what he meant to do. He does not tell poor Smeagol. He says: Smeagol, take me to the Gate \u0426 and then good bye! Smeagol can run away and be good. But now he says: I purpose to enter Mordor this way. So Smeagol is very afraid. He does not want to lose nice master. And he promised, master made him promise, to save the Precious. But master is going to take it to Him, straight to the Black Hand, if master will go this way. So Smeagol must save them both, and he thinks of another way that there was, once upon a time. Nice master. Smeagol very good, always helps.'\n\nSam frowned. If he could have bored holes in Gollum with his eyes, he would have done. His mind was full of doubt. To all appearances Gollum was genuinely distressed and anxious to help Frodo. But Sam, remembering the overheard debate, found it hard to believe that the long submerged Smeagol had come out on top: that voice at any rate had not had the last word in the debate. Sam's guess was that the Smeagol and Gollum halves (or what in his own mind he called Slinker and Stinker) had made a truce and a temporary alliance: neither wanted the Enemy to get the Ring; both wished to keep Frodo from capture, and under their eye, as long as possible \u0426 at any rate as long as Stinker still had a chance of laying hands on his 'Precious'. Whether there really was another way into Mordor Sam doubted.\n\n'And it's a good thing neither half of the old villain don't know what master means to do,' he thought. 'If he knew that Mr. Frodo is trying to put an end to his Precious for good and all, there'd be trouble pretty quick, I bet. Anyhow old Stinker is so frightened of the Enemy \u0426 and he's under orders of some kind from him, or was \u0426 that he'd give us away rather than be caught helping us; and rather than let his Precious be melted, maybe. At least that's my idea. And I hope the master will think it out carefully. He's as wise as any, but he's soft-hearted, that's what he is. It's beyond any Gamgee to guess what he'll do next.'\n\nFrodo did not answer Gollum at once. While these doubts were passing through Sam's slow but shrewd mind, he stood gazing out towards the dark cliff of Cirith Gorgor. The hollow in which they had taken refuge was delved in the side of a low hill, at some little height above a long trenchlike valley that lay between it and the outer buttresses of the mountains. In the midst of the valley stood the black foundations of the western watch-tower. By morning-light the roads that converged upon the Gate of Mordor could now be clearly seen, pale and dusty; one winding back northwards; another dwindling eastwards into the mists that clung about the feet of Ered Lithui; and a third that ran towards him. As it bent sharply round the tower, it entered a narrow defile and passed not far below the hollow where he stood. Westward, to his right, it turned, skirting the shoulders of the mountains, and went off southwards into the deep shadows that mantled all the western sides of Ephel Duath; beyond his sight it journeyed on into the narrow land between the mountains and the Great River.\n\nAs he gazed Frodo became aware that there was a great stir and movement on the plain. It seemed as if whole armies were on the march, though for the most part they were hidden by the reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and wastes beyond. But here and there he caught the gleam of spears and helmets; and over the levels beside the roads horsemen could be seen riding in many companies. He remembered his vision from afar upon Amon Hen, so few days before, though now it seemed many years ago. Then he knew that the hope that had for one wild moment stirred in his heart was vain. The trumpets had not rung in challenge but in greeting. This was no assault upon the Dark Lord by the men of Gondor, risen like avenging ghosts from the graves of valour long passed away. These were Men of other race, out of the wide Eastlands, gathering to the summons of their Overlord; armies that had encamped before his Gate by night and now marched in to swell his mounting power. As if suddenly made fully aware of the peril of their position, alone, in the growing light of day, so near to this vast menace, Frodo quickly drew his frail grey hood close upon his head, and stepped down into the dell. Then he turned to Gollum.\n\n'Smeagol,' he said, 'I will trust you once more. lndeed it seems that I must do so, and that it is my fate to receive help from you, where I least looked for it, and your fate to help me whom you long pursued with evil purpose. So far you have deserved well of me and have kept your promise truly. Truly, I say and mean,' he added with a glance at Sam, 'for twice now we have been in your power, and you have done no harm to us. Nor have you tried to take from me what you once sought. May the third time prove the best! But I warn you, Smeagol, you are in danger.'\n\n'Yes, yes, master!' said Gollum. 'Dreadful danger! Smeagol's bones shake to think of it, but he doesn't run away. He must help nice master.'\n\n'I did not mean the danger that we all share,' said Frodo. 'I mean a danger to yourself alone. You swore a promise by what you call the Precious. Remember that! It will hold you to it; but it will seek a way to twist it to your own undoing. Already you are being twisted. You revealed yourself to me just now, foolishly. Give it back to Smeagol you said. Do not say that again! Do not let that thought grow in you! You will never get it back. But the desire of it may betray you to a bitter end. You will never get it back. In the last need, Smeagol, I should put on the Precious; and the Precious mastered you long ago. If I, wearing it, were to command you, you would obey, even if it were to leap from a precipice or to cast yourself into the fire. And such would be my command. So have a care, Smeagol!'\n\nSam looked at his master with approval, but also with surprise: there was a look in his face and a tone in his voice that he had not known before. It had always been a notion of his that the kindness of dear Mr. Frodo was of such a high degree that it must imply a fair measure of blindness. Of course, he also firmly held the incompatible belief that Mr. Frodo was the wisest person in the world (with the possible exception of Old Mr. Bilbo and of Gandalf). Gollum in his own way, and with much more excuse as his acquaintance was much briefer, may have made a similar mistake, confusing kindness and blindness. At any rate this speech abashed and terrified him. He grovelled on the ground and could speak no clear words but nice master.\n\nFrodo waited patiently for a while, then he spoke again less sternly. 'Come now, Gollum or Smeagol if you wish, tell me of this other way, and show me, if you can, what hope there is in it, enough to justify me in turning aside from my plain path. I am in haste.'\n\nBut Gollum was in a pitiable state, and Frodo's threat had quite unnerved him. It was not easy to get any clear account out of him, amid his mumblings and squeakings, and the frequent interruptions in which he crawled on the floor and begged them both to be kind to 'poor little Smeagol'. After a while he grew a little calmer, and Frodo gathered bit by bit that, if a traveller followed the road that turned west of Ephel Duath, he would come in time to a crossing in a circle of dark trees. On the right a road went down to Osgiliath and the bridges of the Anduin; in the middle the road went on southwards.\n\n'On, on, on,' said Gollum. 'We never went that way, but they say it goes a hundred leagues, until you can see the Great Water that is never still. There are lots of fishes there, and big birds eat fishes: nice birds; but we never went there, alas no! we never had a chance. And further still there are more lands, they say, but the Yellow Face is very hot there, and there are seldom any clouds, and the men are fierce and have dark faces. We do not want to see that land.'\n\n'No!' said Frodo. 'But do not wander from your road. What of the third turning?'\n\n'O yes, O yes, there is a third way,' said Gollum. 'That is the road to the left. At once it begins to climb up, up, winding and climbing back towards the tall shadows. When it turns round the black rock, you'll see it, suddenly you'll see it above you, and you'll want to hide.'\n\n'See it, see it? What will you see?'\n\n'The old fortress, very old, very horrible now. We used to hear tales from the South, when Smeagol was young, long ago. O yes, we used to tell lots of tales in the evening, sitting by the banks of the Great River, in the willow-lands, when the River was younger too, gollum, gollum.' He began to weep and mutter. The hobbits waited patiently.\n\n'Tales out of the South,' Gollum went on again, 'about the tall Men with the shining eyes, and their houses like hills of stone, and the silver crown of their King and his White Tree: wonderful tales. They built very tall towers, and one they raised was silver-white, and in it there was a stone like the Moon, and round it were great white walls. O yes, there were many tales about the Tower of the Moon.'\n\n'That would be Minas Ithil that Isildur the son of Elendil built,' said Frodo. 'It was Isildur who cut off the finger of the Enemy.'\n\n'Yes, He has only four on the Black Hand, but they are enough,' said Gollum shuddering. 'And He hated Isildur's city.'\n\n'What does he not hate?' said Frodo. 'But what has the Tower of the Moon to do with us?'\n\n'Well, master, there it was and there it is: the tall tower and the white houses and the wall; but not nice now, not beautiful. He conquered it long ago. It is a very terrible place now. Travellers shiver when they see it, they creep out of sight, they avoid its shadow. But master will have to go that way. That is the only other way, For the mountains are lower there, and the old road goes up and up, until it reaches a dark pass at the top, and then it goes down, down, again \u0426 to Gorgoroth.' His voice sank to a whisper and he shuddered.\n\n'But how will that help us?' asked Sam. 'Surely the Enemy knows all about his own mountains, and that road will be guarded as close as this? The tower isn't empty, is it?'\n\n'O no, not empty!' whispered Gollum. 'It seems empty, but it isn't, O no! Very dreadful things live there. Orcs, yes always Orcs; but worse things, worse things live there too. The road climbs right under the shadow of the walls and passes the gate. Nothing moves on the road that they don't know about. The things inside know: the Silent Watchers.'\n\n'So that's your advice is it,' said Sam, 'that we should go another long march south, to find ourselves in the same fix or a worse one, when we get there, if we ever do?'\n\n'No, no indeed,' said Gollum. 'Hobbits must see, must try to understand. He does not expect attack that way. His Eye is all round, but it attends more to some places than to others. He can't see everything all at once, not yet. You see, He has conquered all the country west of the Shadowy Mountains down to the River, and He holds the bridges now. He thinks no one can come to the Moontower without fighting big battle at the bridges, or getting lots of boats which they cannot hide and He will know about.'\n\n'You seem to know a lot about what He's doing and thinking,' said Sam. 'Have you been talking to Him lately? Or just hobnobbing with Orcs?'\n\n'Not nice hobbit, not sensible,' said Gollum, giving Sam an angry glance and turning to Frodo. 'Smeagol has talked to Orcs, yes of course, before he met master, and to many peoples: he has walked very far. And what he says now many peoples are saying. It's here in the North that the big danger is for Him, and for us. He will come out of the Black Gate one day, one day soon. That is the only way big armies can come. But away down west He is not afraid, and there are the Silent Watchers.'\n\n'Just so!' said Sam, not to be put off. 'And so we are to walk up and knock at their gate and ask if we're on the right road for Mordor? Or are they too silent to answer? It's not sense. We might as well do it here, and save ourselves a long tramp.'\n\n'Don't make jokes about it,' hissed Gollum. 'It isn't funny, O no! Not amusing. It's not sense to try and get into Mordor at all. But if master says I must go or I will go, then he must try some way. But he must not go to the terrible city, O no, of course not. That is where Smeagol helps, nice Smeagol, though no one tells him what it is all about. Smeagol helps again. He found it. He knows it.'\n\n'What did you find?' asked Frodo.\n\nGollum crouched down and his voice sank to a whisper again. 'A little path leading up into the mountains: and then a stair, a narrow stair, O yes, very long and narrow. And then more stairs. And then' \u0426 his voice sank even lower \u0426 'a tunnel, a dark tunnel; and at last a little cleft, and a path high above the main pass. It was that way that Smeagol got out of the darkness. But it was years ago. The path may have vanished now; but perhaps not, perhaps not.'\n\n'I don't like the sound of it at all,' said Sam. 'Sounds too easy at any rate in the telling. If that path is still there, it'll be guarded too. Wasn't it guarded, Gollum?' As he said this, he caught or fancied he caught a green gleam in Gollum's eye. Gollum muttered but did not reply.\n\n'Is it not guarded?' asked Frodo sternly. 'And did you escape out of the darkness, Smeagol? Were you not rather permitted to depart upon an errand? That at least is what Aragorn thought, who found you by the Dead Marshes some years ago.'\n\n'It's a lie!' hissed Gollum, and an evil light came into his eyes at the naming of Aragorn. 'He lied on me, yes he did. I did escape, all by my poor self. Indeed I was told to seek for the Precious; and I have searched and searched, of course I have. But not for the Black One. The Precious was ours, it was mine I tell you. I did escape.'\n\nFrodo felt a strange certainty that in this matter Gollum was for once not so far from the truth as might be suspected; that he had somehow found a way out of Mordor, and at least believed that it was by his own cunning. For one thing, he noted that Gollum used I, and that seemed usually to be a sign, on its rare appearances. that some remnants of old truth and sincerity were for the moment on top. But even if Gollum could be trusted on this point, Frodo did not forget the wiles of the Enemy. The 'escape' may have been allowed or arranged, and well known in the Dark Tower. And in any case Gollum was plainly keeping a good deal back.\n\n'I ask you again,' he said, 'is not this secret way guarded?'\n\nBut the name of Aragorn had put Gollum into a sullen mood. He had all the injured air of a liar suspected when for once he has told the truth, or part of it. He did not answer.\n\n'Is it not guarded?' Frodo repeated.\n\n'Yes, yes, perhaps. No safe places in this country,' said Gollum sulkily. 'No safe places. But master must try it or go home. No other way.' They could not get him to say more. The name of the perilous place and the high pass he could not tell, or would not.\n\nIts name was Cirith Ungol, a name of dreadful rumour. Aragorn could perhaps have told them that name and its significance: Gandalf would have warned them. But they were alone, and Aragorn was far away, and Gandalf stood amid the ruin of Isengard and strove with Saruman, delayed by treason. Yet even as he spoke his last words to Saruman, and the palantir crashed in fire upon the steps of Orthanc, his thought was ever upon Frodo and Samwise, over the long leagues his mind sought for them in hope and pity.\n\nMaybe Frodo felt it, not knowing it, as he had upon Amon Hen, even though he believed that Gandalf was gone, gone for ever into the shadow in Moria far away. He sat upon the ground for a long while, silent, his head bowed, striving to recall all that Gandalf had said to him. But for this choice he could recall no counsel. Indeed Gandalf's guidance had been taken from them too soon, too soon, while the Dark Land was still very far away. How they should enter it at the last Gandalf had not said. Perhaps he could not say. Into the stronghold of the Enemy in the North, into Dol Guldur, he had once ventured. But into Mordor, to the Mountain of Fire and to Barad-dur, since the Dark Lord rose in power again, had he ever journeyed there? Frodo did not think so. And here he was a little halfling from the Shire, a simple hobbit of the quiet countryside expected to find a way where the great ones could not go, or dared not go. It was an evil fate. But he had taken it on himself in his own sitting-room in the far-off spring of another year, so remote now that it was like a chapter in a story of the world's youth, when the Trees of Silver and Gold were still in bloom. This was an evil choice. Which way should he choose? And if both led to terror and death, what good lay in choice?\n\nThe day drew on. A deep silence fell upon the little grey hollow where they lay, so near to the borders of the land of fear: a silence that could be felt, as if it were a thick veil that cut them off from all the world about them. Above them was a dome of pale sky barred with fleeting smoke, but it seemed high and far away, as if seen through great deeps of air heavy with brooding thought.\n\nNot even an eagle poised against the sun would have marked the hobbits sitting there, under the weight of doom, silent,\u2020not moving, shrouded in their thin grey cloaks. For a moment he might have paused to consider Gollum, a tiny figure sprawling on the ground: there perhaps lay the famished skeleton of some child of Men, its ragged garment still clinging to it, its long arms and legs almost bone-white and bone-thin: no flesh worth a peck.\n\nFrodo's head was bowed over his knees, but Sam leaned back, with hands behind his head, staring out of his hood at the empty sky. At least for a long while it was empty. Then presently Sam thought he saw a dark bird-like figure wheel into the circle of his sight, and hover, and then wheel away again. Two more followed, and then a fourth. They were very small to look at, yet he knew, somehow, that they were huge, with a vast stretch of pinion, flying at a great height. He covered his eyes and bent forward, cowering. The same warning fear was on him as he had felt in the presence of the Black Riders, the helpless horror that had come with the cry in the wind and the shadow on the moon, though now it was not so crushing or compelling: the menace was more remote. But menace it was. Frodo felt it too. His thought was broken. He stirred and shivered, but he did not look up. Gollum huddled himself together like a cornered spider. The winged shapes wheeled, and stooped swiftly down, speeding back to Mordor.\n\nSam took a deep breath. 'The Riders are about again, up in the air,' he said in a hoarse whisper. 'I saw them. Do you think they could see us? They were very high up. And if they are Black Riders same as before, then they can't see much by daylight, can they?'\n\n'No, perhaps not,' said Frodo. 'But their steeds could see. And these winged creatures that they ride on now, they can probably see more than any other creature. They are like great carrion birds. They are looking for something: the Enemy is on the watch, I fear.'\n\nThe feeling of dread passed, but the enfolding silence was broken. For some time they had been cut off from the world, as if in an invisible island; now they were laid bare again, peril had returned. But still Frodo did not speak to Gollum or make his choice. His eyes were closed, as if he were dreaming, or looking inward into his heart and memory. At last he stirred and stood up, and it seemed that he was about to speak and to decide. But 'hark!' he said. 'What is that?'\n\nA new fear was upon them. They heard singing and hoarse shouting. At first it seemed a long way off, but it drew nearer: it was coming towards them. It leaped into all their minds that the Black Wings had spied them and had sent armed soldiers to seize them: no speed seemed too great for these terrible servants of Sauron. They crouched, listening. The voices and the clink of weapons and harness were very close. Frodo and Sam loosened their small swords in their sheaths. Flight was impossible.\n\nGollum rose slowly and crawled insect-like to the lip of the hollow. Very cautiously he raised himself inch by inch, until he could peer over it between two broken points of stone. He remained there without moving for some time, making no sound. Presently the voices began to recede again, and then they slowly faded away. Far off a horn blew on the ramparts of the Morannon. Then quietly Gollum drew back and slipped down into the hollow.\n\n'More Men going to Mordor,' he said in a low voice. 'Dark faces. We have not seen Men like these before, no, Smeagol has not. They are fierce. They have black eyes, and long black hair, and gold rings in their ears; yes, lots of beautiful gold. And some have red paint on their cheeks, and red cloaks; and their flags are red, and the tips of their spears; and they have round shields, yellow and black with big spikes. Not nice; very cruel wicked Men they look. Almost as bad as Orcs, and much bigger. Smeagol thinks they have come out of the South beyond the Great River's end: they came up that road. They have passed on to the Black Gate; but more may follow. Always more people coming to Mordor. One day all the peoples will be inside.'\n\n'Were there any oliphaunts?' asked Sam, forgetting his fear in his eagerness for news of strange places.\n\n'No, no oliphaunts. What are oliphaunts?' said Gollum.\n\nSam stood up, putting his hands behind his back (as he always did when 'speaking poetry'), and began:\n\n\t\tGrey as a mouse,\n\t\tBig as a house.\n\t\tNose like a snake,\n\t\tI make the earth shake,\n\t\tAs I tramp through the grass;\n\t\tTrees crack as I pass.\n\t\tWith horns in my mouth\n\t\tI walk in the South,\n\t\tFlapping big ears.\n\t\tBeyond count of years\n\t\tI stump round and round,\n\t\tNever lie on the ground,\n\t\tNot even to die.\n\t\tOliphaunt am I,\n\t\tBiggest of all,\n\t\tHuge, old, and tall.\n\t\tIf ever you'd met me\n\t\tYou wouldn't forget me.\n\t\tIf you never do,\n\t\tYou won't think I'm true;\n\t\tBut old Oliphaunt am I,\n\t\tAnd I never lie.\n\n'That,' said Sam, when he had finished reciting, 'that's a rhyme we have in the Shire. Nonsense maybe, and maybe not. But we have our tales too, and news out of the South, you know. In the old days hobbits used to go on their travels now and again. Not that many ever came back, and not that all they said was believed: news from Bree, and not sure as Shiretalk, as the sayings go. But I've heard tales of the big folk down away in the Sunlands. Swertings we call 'em in our tales; and they ride on oliphaunts, 'tis said, when they fight. They put houses and towers on the oliphauntses backs and all, and the oliphaunts throw rocks and trees at one another. So when you said \"Men out of the South, all in red and gold;\" I said \"were there any oliphaunts?\" For if there was, I was going to take a look, risk or no. But now I don't suppose I'll ever see an oliphaunt. Maybe there ain't no such a beast.' He sighed.\n\n'No, no oliphaunts,' said Gollum again. 'Smeagol has not heard of them. He does not want to see them. He does not want them to be. Smeagol wants to go away from here and hide somewhere safer. Smeagol wants master to go. Nice master, won't he come with Smeagol?'\n\nFrodo stood up. He had laughed in the midst of all his cares when Sam trotted out the old fireside rhyme of Oliphaunt, and the laugh had released him from hesitation. 'I wish we had a thousand oliphaunts with Gandalf on a white one at their head,' he said. 'Then we'd break a way into this evil land, perhaps. But we've not; just our own tired legs, that's all. Well, Smeagol, the third turn may turn the best. I will come with you.'\n\n'Good master, wise master, nice master!' cried Gollum in delight, patting Frodo's knees. 'Good master! Then rest now, nice hobbits, under the shadow of the stones, close under the stones! Rest and lie quiet, till the Yellow Face goes away. Then we can go quickly. Soft and quick as shadows we must be!'\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nOf Herbs and Stewed Rabbit\n\nFor the few hours of daylight that were left they rested, shifting into the shade as the sun moved, until at last the shadow of the western rim of their dell grew long, and darkness filled all the hollow. Then they ate a little, and drank sparingly. Gollum ate nothing, but he accepted water gladly.\n\n'Soon get more now,' he said, licking his lips. 'Good water runs down in streams to the Great River, nice water in the lands we are going to. Smeagol will get food there too, perhaps. He's very hungry, yes, gollum!' He set his two large flat hands on his shrunken belly, and a pale green light came into his eyes.\n\nThe dusk was deep when at length they set out, creeping over the westward rim of the dell, and fading like ghosts into the broken country on the borders of the road. The moon was now three nights from the full, but it did not climb over the mountains until nearly midnight, and the early night was very dark. A single red light burned high up in the Towers of the Teeth, but otherwise no sign could be seen or heard of the sleepless watch on the Morannon.\n\nFor many miles the red eye seemed to stare at them as they fled, stumbling through a barren stony country. They did not dare to take the road, but they kept it on their left, following its line as well as they could at a little distance. At last, when night was growing old and they were already weary, for they had taken only one short rest, the eye dwindled to a small fiery point and then vanished: they had turned the dark northern shoulder of the lower mountains and were heading southwards.\n\nWith hearts strangely lightened they now rested again, but not for long. They were not going quick enough for Gollum. By his reckoning it was nearly thirty leagues from the Morannon to the cross-roads above Osgiliath, and he hoped to cover that distance in four journeys. So soon they struggled on once more, until the dawn began to spread slowly in the wide grey solitude. They had then walked almost eight leagues; and the hobbits could not have gone any further, even if they had dared.\n\nThe growing light revealed to them a land already, less barren and ruinous. The mountains still loomed up ominously on their left, but near at hand they could see the southward road, now bearing away from the black roots of the hills and slanting westwards. Beyond it were slopes covered with sombre trees like dark clouds, but all about them lay a tumbled heathland, grown with ling and broom and cornel, and other shrubs that they did not know. Here and there they saw knots of tall pine-trees. The hearts of the hobbits rose again a little in spite of weariness: the air was fresh and fragrant, and it reminded them of the uplands of the Northfarthing far away. It seemed good to be reprieved, to walk in a land that had only been for a few years under the dominion of the Dark Lord and was not yet fallen wholly into decay. But they did not forget their danger, nor the Black Gate that was still all too near, hidden though it was behind the gloomy heights. They looked about for a hiding-place where they could shelter from evil eyes while the light lasted.\n\nThe day passed uneasily. They lay deep in the heather and counted out the slow hours, in which there seemed little change; for they were still under the shadows of the Ephel Duath, and the sun was veiled. Frodo slept at times, deeply and peacefully, either trusting Gollum or too tired to trouble about him; but Sam found it difficult to do more than doze, even when Gollum was plainly fast asleep, whiffling and twitching in his secret dreams. Hunger, perhaps, more than mistrust kept him wakeful: he had begun to long for a good homely meal, 'something hot out of the pot'.\n\nAs soon as the land faded into a formless grey under coming night, they started out again. In a little while Gollum led them down on to the southward road; and after that they went on more quickly, though the danger was greater. Their ears were strained for the sound of hoof or foot on the road ahead, or following them from behind; but the night passed, and they heard no sound of walker or rider.\n\nThe road had been made in a long lost time: and for perhaps thirty miles below the Morannon it had been newly repaired, but as it went south the wild encroached upon it. The handiwork of Men of old could still be seen in its straight sure flight and level course: now and again it cut its way through hillside slopes, or leaped over a stream upon a wide shapely arch of enduring masonry; but at last all signs of stonework faded, save for a broken pillar here and there, peering out of bushes at the side, or old paving-stones still lurking amid weeds and moss. Heather and trees and bracken scrambled down and overhung the banks, or sprawled out over the surface. It dwindled at last to a country cart-road little used; but it did not wind: it held on its own sure course and guided them by the swiftest way.\n\nSo they passed into the northern marches of that land that Men once called Ithilien, a fair country of climbing woods and swift-falling streams. The night became fine under star and round moon, and it seemed to the hobbits that the fragrance of the air grew as they went forward; and from the blowing and muttering of Gollum it seemed that he noticed it too, and did not relish it. At the first signs of day they halted again. They had come to the end of a long cutting, deep, and sheer-sided in the middle, by which the road clove its way through a stony ridge. Now they climbed up the westward bank and looked abroad.\n\nDay was opening in the sky, and they saw that the mountains were now much further off, receding eastward in a long curve that was lost in the distance. Before them, as they turned west, gentle slopes ran down into dim hazes far below. All about them were small woods of resinous trees, fir and cedar and cypress, and other kinds unknown in the Shire, with wide glades among them; and everywhere there was a wealth of sweet-smelling herbs and shrubs. The long journey from Rivendell had brought them far south of their own land, but not until now in this more sheltered region had the hobbits felt the change of clime. Here Spring was already busy about them: fronds pierced moss and mould, larches were green-fingered, small flowers were opening in the turf, birds were singing. Ithilien, the garden of Gondor now desolate kept still a dishevelled dryad loveliness.\n\nSouth and west it looked towards the warm lower vales of Anduin, shielded from the east by the Ephel Duath and yet not under the mountain-shadow, protected from the north by the Emyn Muil, open to the southern airs and the moist winds from the Sea far away. Many great trees grew there, planted long ago, falling into untended age amid a riot of careless descendants; and groves and thickets there were of tamarisk and pungent terebinth, of olive and of bay; and there were junipers and myrtles; and thymes that grew in bushes, or with their woody creeping stems mantled in deep tapestries the hidden stones; sages of many kinds putting forth blue flowers, or red, or pale green; and marjorams and new-sprouting parsleys, and many herbs of forms and scents beyond the garden-lore of Sam. The grots and rocky walls were already starred with saxifrages and stonecrops. Primeroles and anemones were awake in the filbert-brakes; and asphodel and many lily-flowers nodded their half-opened heads in the grass: deep green grass beside the pools, where falling streams halted in cool hollows on their journey down to Anduin.\n\nThe travellers turned their backs on the road and went downhill. As they walked, brushing their way through bush and herb, sweet odours rose about them. Gollum coughed and retched; but the hobbits breathed deep, and suddenly Sam laughed, for heart's ease not for jest. They followed a stream that went quickly down before them. Presently it brought them to a small clear lake in a shallow dell: it lay in the broken ruins of an ancient stone basin, the carven rim of which was almost wholly covered with mosses and rose-brambles; iris-swords stood in ranks about it, and water-lily leaves floated on its dark gently-rippling surface; but it was deep and fresh, and spilled ever softly out over a stony lip at the far end.\n\nHere they washed themselves and drank their fill at the in-falling freshet. Then they sought for a resting-place, and a hiding-place: for this land, fair-seeming still, was nonetheless now territory of the Enemy. They had not come very far from the road, and yet even in so short a space they had seen scars of the old wars, and the newer wounds made by the Orcs and other foul servants of the Dark Lord: a pit of uncovered filth and refuse; trees hewn down wantonly and left to die, with evil runes or the fell sign of the Eye cut in rude strokes on their bark.\n\nSam scrambling below the outfall of the lake, smelling and touching the unfamiliar plants and trees, forgetful for the moment of Mordor, was reminded suddenly of their ever-present peril. He stumbled on a ring still scorched by fire, and in the midst of it he found a pile of charred and broken bones and skulls. The swift growth of the wild with briar and eglantine and trailing clematis was already drawing a veil over this place of dreadful feast and slaughter; but it was not ancient. He hurried back to his companions, but he said nothing: the bones were best left in peace and not pawed and routed by Gollum.\n\n'Let's find a place to lie up in,' he said. 'Not lower down. Higher up for me.'\n\nA little way back above the lake they found a deep brown bed of last year's fern. Beyond it was a thicket of dark-leaved bay-trees climbing up a steep bank that was crowned with old cedars. Here they decided to rest and pass the day, which already promised to be bright and warm. A good day for strolling on their way along the groves and glades of Ithilien; but though Orcs may shun the sunlight, there were too many places here where they could lie hid and watch; and other evil eyes were abroad: Sauron had many servants. Gollum, in any case, would not move under the Yellow Face. Soon it would look over the dark ridges of the Ephel Duath, and he would faint and cower in the light and heat.\n\nSam had been giving earnest thought to food as they marched. Now that the despair of the impassable Gate was behind him, he did not feel so inclined as his master to take no thought for their livelihood beyond the end of their errand; and anyway it seemed wiser to him to save the waybread of the Elves for worse times ahead. Six days or more had passed since he reckoned that they had only a bare supply for three weeks.\n\n'If we reach the Fire in that time, we'll be lucky at this rate!' he thought. 'And we might be wanting to get back. We might!'\n\nBesides, at the end of a long night-march, and after bathing and drinking, he felt even more hungry than usual. A supper, or a breakfast, by the fire in the old kitchen at Bagshot Row was what he really wanted. An idea struck him and he turned to Gollum. Gollum had just begun to sneak off on his own, and he was crawling away on all fours through the fern.\n\n'Hi! Gollum!' said Sam. 'Where are you going? Hunting? Well see here, old noser, you don't like our food, and I'd not be sorry for a change myself. Your new motto's always ready to help. Could you find anything fit for a hungry hobbit?'\n\n'Yes, perhaps, yes,' said Gollum. 'Smeagol always helps, if they asks \u0426 if they asks nicely.'\n\n'Right!' said Sam 'I does ask. And if that isn't nice enough, I begs.'\n\nGollum disappeared. He was away some time, and Frodo after a few mouthfuls of lembas settled deep into the brown fern and went to sleep. Sam looked at him. The early daylight was only just creeping down into the shadows under the trees, but he saw his master's face very clearly, and his hands, too, lying at rest on the ground beside him. He was reminded suddenly of Frodo as he had lain, asleep in the house of Elrond, after his deadly wound. Then as he had kept watch Sam had noticed that at times a light seemed to be shining faintly within; but now the light was even clearer and stronger. Frodo's face was peaceful, the marks of fear and care had left it; but it looked old, old and beautiful, as if the chiselling of the shaping years was now revealed in many fine lines that had before been hidden, though the identity of the face was not changed. Not that Sam Gamgee put it that way to himself. He shook his head, as if finding words useless, and murmured: 'I love him. He's like that, and sometimes it shines through, somehow. But I love him, whether or no.'\n\nGollum returned quietly and peered over Sam's shoulder. Looking at Frodo, he shut his eyes and crawled away without a sound. Sam came to him a moment later and found him chewing something and muttering to himself. On the ground beside him lay two small rabbits, which he was beginning to eye greedily.\n\n'Smeagol always helps,' he said. 'He has brought rabbits, nice rabbits. But master has gone to sleep, and perhaps Sam wants to sleep. Doesn't want rabbits now? Smeagol tries to help, but he can't catch things all in a minute.'\n\nSam, however, had no objection to rabbit at all, and said so. At least not to cooked rabbit. All hobbits, of course, can cook, for they begin to learn the art before their letters (which many never reach): but Sam was a good cook, even by hobbit reckoning, and he had done a good deal of the camp-cooking on their travels, when there was a chance. He still hopefully carried some of his gear in his pack: a small tinder-box, two small shallow pans, the smaller fitting into the larger; inside them a wooden spoon, a short two-pronged fork and some skewers were stowed; and hidden at the bottom of the pack in a flat wooden box a dwindling treasure, some salt. But he needed a fire, and other things besides. He thought for a bit, while he took out his knife, cleaned and whetted it, and began to dress the rabbits. He was not going to leave Frodo alone asleep even for a few minutes.\n\n'Now, Gollum,' he said, 'I've another job for you. Go and fill these pans with water, and bring 'em back!'\n\n'Smeagol will fetch water, yes,' said Gollum. 'But what does the hobbit want all that water for? He has drunk, he has washed.'\n\n'Never you mind,' said Sam. 'If you can't guess, you'll soon find out. And the sooner you fetch the water, the sooner you'll learn. Don't you damage one of my pans, or I'll carve you into mincemeat.'\n\nWhile Gollum was away Sam took another look at Frodo. He was still sleeping quietly, but Sam was now struck most by the leanness of his face and hands. 'Too thin and drawn he is,' he muttered. 'Not right for a hobbit. If I can get these coneys cooked, I'm going to wake him up.'\n\nSam gathered a pile of the driest fern, and then scrambled up the bank collecting a bundle of twigs and broken wood; the fallen branch of a cedar at the top gave him a good supply. He cut out some turves at the foot of the bank just outside the fern-brake, and made a shallow hole and laid his fuel in it. Being handy with flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going. It made little or no smoke but gave off an aromatic scent. He was just stooping over his fire, shielding it and building it up with heavier wood, when Gollum returned, carrying the pans carefully and grumbling to himself.\n\nHe set the pans down, and then suddenly saw what Sam was doing. He gave a thin hissing shriek, and seemed to be both frightened and angry. 'Ach! Sss \u0426 no!' he cried. 'No! Silly hobbits, foolish, yes foolish! They mustn't do it!'\n\n'Mustn't do what?' asked Sam in surprise.\n\n'Not make the nassty red tongues,' hissed Gollum. 'Fire, fire! It's dangerous, yes it is. It burns, it kills. And it will bring enemies, yes it will.'\n\n'I don't think so,' said Sam. 'Don't see why it should, if you don't put wet stuff on it and make a smother. But if it does, it does. I'm going to risk it, anyhow. I'm going to stew these coneys.'\n\n'Stew the rabbits!' squealed Gollum in dismay. 'Spoil beautiful meat Smeagol saved for you, poor hungry Smeagol! What for? What for, silly hobbit? They are young, they are tender, they are nice. Eat them, eat them!' He clawed at the nearest rabbit, already skinned and lying by the fire.\n\n'Now, now!' said Sam. 'Each to his own fashion. Our bread chokes you, and raw coney chokes me. If you give me a coney, the coney's mine, see, to cook, if I have a mind. And I have. You needn't watch me. Go and catch another and eat it as you fancy \u0426 somewhere private and out o' my sight. Then you won't see the fire, and I shan't see you, and we'll both be the happier. I'll see the fire don't smoke, if that's any comfort to you.'\n\nGollum withdrew grumbling, and crawled into the fern. Sam busied himself with his pans. 'What a hobbit needs with coney,' he said to himself, 'is some herbs and roots, especially taters \u0426 not to mention bread. Herbs we can manage, seemingly.'\n\n'Gollum!' he called softly. 'Third time pays for all. I want some herbs.' Gollum's head peeped out of the fern, but his looks were neither helpful nor friendly. 'A few bay-leaves, some thyme and sage, will do \u0426 before the water boils,' said Sam.\n\n'No!' said Gollum. 'Smeagol is not pleased. And Smeagol doesn't like smelly leaves. He doesn't eat grasses or roots, no precious, not till he's starving or very sick, poor Smeagol. '\n\n'Smeagol'll get into real true hot water, when this water boils, if he don't do as he's asked,' growled Sam. 'Sam'll put his head in it, yes precious. And I'd make him look for turnips and carrots, and taters too, if it was the time o' the year. I'll bet there's all sorts of good things running wild in this country. I'd give a lot for half a dozen taters.'\n\n'Smeagol won't go, O no precious, not this time,' hissed Gollum. 'He's frightened, and he's very tired, and this hobbit's not nice, not nice at all. Smeagol won't grub for roots and carrotses and \u0426 taters. What's taters, precious, eh, what's taters?\n\n'Po-ta-toes,' said Sam. 'The Gaffer's delight, and rare good ballast for an empty belly. But you won't find any, so you needn't look. But be good Smeagol and fetch me the herbs, and I'll think better of you. What's more, if you turn over a new leaf, and keep it turned, I'll cook you some taters one of these days, I will: fried fish and chips served by S. Gamgee. You couldn't say no to that.'\n\n'Yes, yes we could. Spoiling nice fish, scorching it. Give me fish now, and keep nassty chips!'\n\n'Oh you're hopeless,' said Sam. 'Go to sleep!'\n\nIn the end he had to find what he wanted for himself; but he did not have to go far, not out of sight of the place where his master lay, still sleeping. For a while Sam sat musing, and tending the fire till the water boiled. The daylight grew and the air became warm; the dew faded off turf and leaf. Soon the rabbits cut up lay simmering in their pans with the bunched herbs. Almost Sam fell asleep as the time went by. He let them stew for close on an hour, testing them now and again with his fork, and tasting the broth.\n\nWhen he thought all was ready he lifted the pans off the fire, and crept along to Frodo. Frodo half opened his eyes as Sam stood over him, and then he wakened from his dreaming: another gentle, unrecoverable dream of peace.\n\n'Hullo, Sam!' he said. 'Not resting? Is anything wrong? What is the time?'\n\n'About a couple of hours after daybreak,' said Sam, 'and nigh on half past eight by Shire clocks, maybe. But nothing's wrong. Though it ain't quite what I'd call right: no stock, no onions, no taters. I've got a bit of a stew for you, and some broth, Mr. Frodo. Do you good. You'll have to sup it in your mug; or straight from the pan, when it's cooled a bit. I haven't brought no bowls, nor nothing proper.'\n\nFrodo yawned and stretched. 'You should have been resting Sam,' he said. 'And lighting a fire was dangerous in these parts. But I do feel hungry. Hmm! Can I smell it from here? What have you stewed?'\n\n'A present from Smeagol,' said Sam: 'a brace o' young coneys; though I fancy Gollum's regretting them now. But there's nought to go with them but a few herbs.'\n\nSam and his master sat just within the fern-brake and ate their stew from the pans, sharing the old fork and spoon. They allowed themselves half a piece of the Elvish waybread each. It seemed a feast.\n\n'Wheew! Gollum!' Sam called and whistled softly. 'Come on! Still time to change your mind. There's some left, if you want to try stewed coney.' There was no answer.\n\n'Oh well, I suppose he's gone off to find something for himself. We'll finish it,' said Sam.\n\n'And then you must take some sleep,' said Frodo.\n\n'Don't you drop off, while I'm nodding, Mr. Frodo. I don't feel too sure of him. There's a good deal of Stinker \u0426 the bad Gollum, if you understand me \u0426 in him still, and it's getting stronger again. Not but what I think he'd try to throttle me first now. We don't see eye to eye, and he's not pleased with Sam, O no precious, not pleased at all.'\n\nThey finished, and Sam went off to the stream to rinse his gear. As he stood up to return, he looked back up the slope. At that moment he saw the sun rise out of the reek, or haze, or dark shadow, or whatever it was, that lay ever to the east, and it sent its golden beams down upon the trees and glades about him. Then he noticed a thin spiral of blue-grey, smoke, plain to see as it caught the sunlight, rising from a thicket above him. With a shock he realized that this was the smoke from his little cooking-fire, which he had neglected to put out.\n\n'That won't do! Never thought it would show like that!' he muttered, and he started to hurry back. Suddenly he halted and listened. Had he heard a whistle or not? Or was it the call of some strange bird? If it was a whistle, it did not come from Frodo's direction. There it went again from another place! Sam began to run as well as he could uphill.\n\nHe found that a small brand, burning away to its outer end, had kindled some fern at the edge of the fire, and the fern blazing up had set the turves smouldering. Hastily he stamped out what was left of the fire, scattered the ashes, and laid the turves on the hole. Then he crept back to Frodo.\n\n'Did you hear a whistle, and what sounded like an answer?' he asked. 'A few minutes back. I hope it was only a bird, but it didn't sound quite like that: more like somebody mimicking a bird-call, I thought. And I'm afraid my bit of fire's been smoking. Now if I've gone and brought trouble, I'll never forgive myself. Nor won't have a chance, maybe!'\n\n'Hush!' whispered Frodo. 'I thought I heard voices.'\n\nThe two hobbits trussed their small packs, put them on ready for flight, and then crawled deeper into the fern. There they crouched listening.\n\nThere was no doubt of the voices. They were speaking low and furtively, but they were near, and coming nearer. Then quite suddenly one spoke clearly close at hand.\n\n'Here! Here is where the smoke came from!' it said. ''Twill be nigh at hand. In the fern, no doubt. We shall have it like a coney in a trap. Then we shall learn what kind of thing it is.'\n\n'Aye, and what it knows!' said a second voice.\n\nAt once four men came striding through the fern from different directions. Since flight and hiding were no longer possible, Frodo and Sam sprang to their feet, putting back to back and whipping out their small swords.\n\nIf they were astonished at what they saw, their captors were even more astonished. Four tall Men stood there. Two had spears in their hands with broad bright heads. Two had great bows, almost of their own height, and great quivers of long green-feathered arrows. All had swords at their sides, and were clad in green and brown of varied hues, as if the better to walk unseen in the glades of Ithilien. Green gauntlets covered their hands, and their faces were hooded and masked with green, except for their eyes, which were very keen and bright. At once Frodo thought of Boromir, for these Men were like him in stature and bearing, and in their manner of speech.\n\n'We have not found what we sought,' said one. 'But what have we found?'\n\n'Not Orcs,' said another, releasing the hilt of his sword, which he had seized when he saw the glitter of Sting in Frodo's hand.\n\n'Elves?' said a third, doubtfully.\n\n'Nay! Not Elves,' said the fourth, the tallest, and as it appeared the chief among them. 'Elves do not walk in Ithilien in these days. And Elves are wondrous fair to look upon, or so 'tis said.'\n\n'Meaning we're not, I take you,' said Sam. 'Thank you kindly. And when you've finished discussing us, perhaps you'll say who you are, and why you can't let two tired travellers rest.'\n\nThe tall green man laughed grimly. 'I am Faramir, Captain of Gondor,' he said. 'But there are no travellers in this land: only the servants of the Dark Tower, or of the White.'\n\n'But we are neither,' said Frodo. 'And travellers we are, whatever Captain Faramir may say.'\n\n'Then make haste to declare yourselves and your errand,' said Faramir. 'We have a work to do, and this is no time or place for riddling or parleying. Come! Where is the third of your company?'\n\n'The third?'\n\n'Yes, the skulking fellow that we saw with his nose in the pool down yonder. He had an ill-favoured look. Some spying breed of Orc, I guess, or a creature of theirs. But he gave us the slip by some fox-trick.'\n\n'I do not know where he is,' said Frodo. 'He is only a chance companion met upon our road; and I am not answerable for him. If you come on him, spare him. Bring him or send him to us. He is only a wretched gangrel creature, but I have him under my care for a while. But as for us, we are Hobbits of the Shire, far to the North and West, beyond many rivers. Frodo son of Drogo is my name, and with me is Samwise son of Hamfast, a worthy hobbit in my service. We have come by long ways \u0426 out of Rivendell, or Imladris as some call it.' Here Faramir started and grew intent. 'Seven companions we had: one we lost at Moria, the others we left at Parth Galen above Rauros: two of my kin; a Dwarf there was also, and an Elf, and two Men. They were Aragorn; and Boromir, who said that he came out of Minas Tirith, a city in the South.'\n\n'Boromir!' all the four men exclaimed.\n\n'Boromir son of the Lord Denethor?' said Faramir, and a strange stern look came into his face. 'You came with him? That is news indeed, if it be true. Know, little strangers, that Boromir son of Denethor was High Warden of the White Tower, and our Captain-General: sorely do we miss him. Who are you then, and what had you to do with him? Be swift, for the Sun is climbing!'\n\n'Are the riddling words known to you that Boromir brought to Rivendell?' Frodo replied.\n\n\t\tSeek for the Sword that was Broken.\n\t\tIn Imladris it dwells.\n\n'The words are known indeed,' said Faramir in astonishment. 'It is some token of your truth that you also know them.'\n\n'Aragorn whom I named is the bearer of the Sword that was Broken,' said Frodo. 'And we are the Halflings that the rhyme spoke of.'\n\n'That I see,' said Faramir thoughtfully. 'Or I see that it might be so. And what is Isildur's Bane?'\n\n'That is hidden,' answered Frodo. 'Doubtless it will be made clear in time.'\n\n'We must learn more of this,' said Faramir, 'and know what brings you so far east under the shadow of yonder\u0426,' he pointed and said no name. 'But not now. We have business in hand. You are in peril, and you would not have gone far by field or road this day. There will be hard handstrokes nigh at hand ere the day is full. Then death, or swift flight bark to Anduin. I will leave two to guard you, for your good and for mine. Wise man trusts not to chance-meeting on the road in this land. If I return, I will speak more with you.'\n\n'Farewell!' said Frodo, bowing low. 'Think what you will, I am a friend of all enemies of the One Enemy. We would go with you, if we halfling folk could hope to serve you, such doughty men and strong as you seem, and if my errand permitted it. May the light shine on your swords!'\n\n'The Halflings are courteous folk, whatever else they be,' said Faramir. 'Farewell!'\n\nThe hobbits sat down again, but they said nothing to one another of their thoughts and doubts. Close by, just under the dappling shadow of the dark bay-trees, two men remained on guard. They took off their masks now and again to cool them, as the day-heat grew, and Frodo saw that they were goodly men, pale-skinned, dark of hair, with grey eyes and faces sad and proud. They spoke together in soft voices, at first using the Common Speech, but after the manner of older days, and then changing to another language of their own. To his amazement, as he listened Frodo became aware that it was the Elven-tongue that they spoke, or one but little different; and he looked at them with wonder, for he knew then that they must be Dunedain of the South, men of the line of the Lords of Westernesse.\n\nAfter a while he spoke to them; but they were slow and cautious in answering. They named themselves Mablung and Damrod, soldiers of Gondor, and they were Rangers of Ithilien; for they were descended from folk who lived in Ithilien at one time, before it was overrun. From such men the Lord Denethor chose his forayers, who crossed the Anduin secretly (how or where, they would not say) to harry the Orcs and other enemies that roamed between the Ephel Duath and the River.\n\n'It is close on ten leagues hence to the east-shore of Anduin,' said Mablung, 'and we seldom come so far afield. But we have a new errand on this journey: we come to ambush the Men of Harad. Curse them!'\n\n'Aye, curse the Southrons!' said Damrod. ''Tis said that there were dealings of old between Gondor and the kingdoms of the Harad in the Far South; though there was never friendship. In those days our bounds were away south beyond the mouths of Anduin, and Umbar, the nearest of their realms, acknowledged our sway. But that is long since. 'Tis many lives of Men since any passed to or fro between us. Now of late we have learned that the Enemy has been among them, and they are gone over to Him, or back to Him \u0426 they were ever ready to His will \u0426 as have so many also in the East. I doubt not that the days of Gondor are numbered, and the walls of Minas Tirith are doomed, so great is His strength and malice.'\n\n'But still we will not sit idle and let Him do all as He would,' said Mablung. 'These cursed Southrons come now marching up the ancient roads to swell the hosts of the Dark Tower. Yea, up the very roads that craft of Gondor made. And they go ever more heedlessly, we learn, thinking that the power of their new master is great enough, so that the mere shadow of His hills will protect them. We come to teach them another lesson. Great strength of them was reported to us some days ago, marching north. One of their regiments is due by our reckoning to pass by, some time ere noon-up on the road above, where it passes through the cloven way. The road may pass, but they shall not! Not while Faramir is Captain. He leads now in all perilous ventures. But his life is charmed, or fate spares him for some other end.'\n\nTheir talk died down into a listening silence. All seemed still and watchful. Sam, crouched by the edge of the fern-brake, peered out. With his keen hobbit-eyes he saw that many more Men were about. He could see them stealing up the slopes, singly or in long files, keeping always to the shade of grove or thicket, or crawling, hardly visible in their brown and green raiment, through grass and brake. All were hooded and masked, and had gauntlets on their hands, and were armed like Faramir and his companions. Before long they had all passed and vanished. The sun rose till it neared the South. The shadows shrank.\n\n'I wonder where that dratted Gollum is?' thought Sam, as he crawled back into deeper shade. 'He stands a fair chance of being spitted for an Orc, or of being roasted by the Yellow Face. But I fancy he'll look after himself.' He lay down beside Frodo and began to doze.\n\nHe woke, thinking that he had heard horns blowing. He sat up. It was now high noon. The guards stood alert and tense in the shadow of the trees. Suddenly the horns rang out louder and beyond mistake from above, over the top of the slope. Sam thought that he heard cries and wild shouting also, but the sound was faint, as if it came out of some distant cave. Then presently the noise of fighting broke out near at hand, just above their hiding-place. He could hear plainly the ringing grate of steel on steel, the clang of sword on iron cap, the dull beat of blade on shield; men were yelling and screaming, and one clear loud voice was calling Gondor! Gondor!\n\n'It sounds like a hundred blacksmiths all smithying together,' said Sam to Frodo. 'They're as near as I want them now.'\n\nBut the noise grew closer. 'They are coming!' cried Damrod. 'See! Some of the Southrons have broken from the trap and are flying from the road. There they go! Our men after them, and the Captain leading.'\n\nSam, eager to see more, went now and joined the guards. He scrambled a little way up into one of the larger of the bay-trees. For a moment he caught a glimpse of swarthy men in red running down the slope some way off with green-clad warriors leaping after them, hewing them down as they fled. Arrows were thick in the air. Then suddenly straight over the rim of their sheltering bank, a man fell, crashing through the slender trees, nearly on top of them. He came to rest in the fern a few feet away, face downward, green arrow-feathers sticking from his neck below a golden collar. His scarlet robes were tattered, his corslet of overlapping brazen plates was rent and hewn, his black plaits of hair braided with gold were drenched with blood. His brown hand still clutched the hilt of a broken sword.\n\nIt was Sam's first view of a battle of Men against Men, and he did not like it much. He was glad that he could not see the dead face. He wondered what the man's name was and where he came from; and if he was really evil of heart, or what lies or threats had led him on the long march from his home; and if he would not really rather have stayed there in peace \u0426 all in a flash of thought which was quickly driven from his mind. For just as Mablung stepped towards the fallen body, there was a new noise. Great crying and shouting. Amidst it Sam heard a shrill bellowing or trumpeting. And then a great thudding and bumping. like huge rams dinning on the ground.\n\n'Ware! Ware!' cried Damrod to his companion. 'May the Valar turn him aside! Mumak! Mumak!'\n\nTo his astonishment and terror, and lasting delight, Sam saw a vast shape crash out of the trees and come careering down the slope. Big as a house, much bigger than a house, it looked to him, a grey-clad moving hill. Fear and wonder, maybe, enlarged him in the hobbit's eyes, but the Mumak of Harad was indeed a beast of vast bulk, and the like of him does not walk now in Middle-earth; his kin that live still in latter days are but memories of his girth and majesty. On he came, straight towards the watchers, and then swerved aside in the nick of time, passing only a few yards away, rocking the ground beneath their feet: his great legs like trees, enormous sail-like ears spread out, long snout upraised like a huge serpent about to strike. his small red eyes raging. His upturned hornlike tusks were bound with bands of gold and dripped with blood. His trappings of scarlet and gold flapped about him in wild tatters. The ruins of what seemed a very war-tower lay upon his heaving back, smashed in his furious passage through the woods; and high upon his neck still desperately clung a tiny figure \u0426 the body of a mighty warrior, a giant among the Swertings.\n\nOn the great beast thundered, blundering in blind wrath through pool and thicket. Arrows skipped and snapped harmlessly about the triple hide of his flanks. Men of both sides fled before him, but many he overtook and crushed to the ground. Soon he was lost to view, still trumpeting and stamping far away. What became of him Sam never heard: whether he escaped to roam the wild for a time, until he perished far from his home or was trapped in some deep pit; or whether he raged on until he plunged in the Great River and was swallowed up.\n\nSam drew a deep breath. 'An Oliphaunt it was!' he said. 'So there are Oliphaunts, and I have seen one. What a life! But no one at home will ever believe me. Well, if that's over, I'll have a bit of sleep.'\n\n'Sleep while you may,' said Mablung. 'But the Captain will return, if he is unhurt; and when he comes we shall depart swiftly. We shall be pursued as soon as news of our deed reaches the Enemy, and that will not be long.'\n\n'Go quietly when you must!' said Sam. 'No need to disturb my sleep. I was walking all night.'\n\nMablung laughed. 'I do not think the Captain will leave you here, Master Samwise,' he said. 'But you shall see.'\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Window on the West\n\nIt seemed to Sam that he had only dozed for a few minutes when he awoke to find that it was late afternoon and Faramir had come back. He had brought many men with him; indeed all the survivors of the foray were now gathered on the slope nearby, two or three hundred strong. They sat in a wide semicircle, between the arms of which Faramir was seated on the ground, while Frodo stood before him. It looked strangely like the trial of a prisoner.\n\nSam crept out from the fern, but no one paid any attention to him, and he placed himself at the end of the rows of men, where he could see and hear all that was going on. He watched and listened intently, ready to dash to his master's aid if needed. He could see Faramir's face, which was now unmasked: it was stern and commanding, and a keen wit lay behind his searching glance. Doubt was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at Frodo.\n\nSam soon became aware that the Captain was not satisfied with Frodo's account of himself at several points: what part he had to play in the Company that set out from Rivendell; why he had left Boromir; and where he was now going. In particular he returned often to Isildur's Bane. Plainly he saw that Frodo was concealing from him some matter of great importance.\n\n'But it was at the coming of the Halfling that Isildur's Bane should waken, or so one must read the words,' he insisted. 'If then you are the Halfling that was named, doubtless you brought this thing, whatever it may be, to the Council of which you speak, and there Boromir saw it. Do you deny it?'\n\nFrodo made no answer. 'So!' said Faramir. 'I wish then to learn from you more of it; for what concerns Boromir concerns me. An orc-arrow slew Isildur, so far as old tales tell. But orc-arrows are plenty, and the sight of one would not be taken as a sign of Doom by Boromir of Gondor. Had you this thing in keeping? It is hidden, you say; but is not that because you choose to hide it?'\n\n'No, not because I choose,' answered Frodo. 'It does not belong to me. It does not belong to any mortal, great or small; though if any could claim it, it would be Aragorn son of Arathorn, whom I named, the leader of our Company from Moria to Rauros.'\n\n'Why so, and not Boromir, prince of the City that the sons of Elendil founded?'\n\n'Because Aragorn is descended in direct lineage, father to father, from Isildur Elendil's son himself. And the sword that he bears was Elendil's sword.'\n\nA murmur of astonishment ran through all the ring of men. Some cried aloud: 'The sword of Elendil! The sword of Elendil comes to Minas Tirith! Great tidings!' But Faramir's face was unmoved.\n\n'Maybe,' he said. 'But so great a claim will need to be established and clear proofs will be required, should this Aragorn ever come to Minas Tirith. He had not come, nor any of your Company, when I set out six days ago.'\n\n'Boromir was satisfied of that claim,' said Frodo. 'Indeed, if Boromir were here, he would answer all your questions. And since he was already at Rauros many days back, and intended then to go straight to your city, if you return, you may soon learn the answers there. My part in the Company was known to him, as to all the others, for it was appointed to me by Elrond of Imladris himself before the whole Council. On that errand I came into this country, but it is not mine to reveal to any outside the Company. Yet those who claim to oppose the Enemy would do well not to hinder it.'\n\nFrodo's tone was proud, whatever he felt, and Sam approved of it; but it did not appease Faramir.\n\n'So!' he said. 'You bid me mind my own affairs, and get me back home, and let you be. Boromir will tell all, when he comes. When he comes, say you! Were you a friend of Boromir?'\n\nVividly before Frodo's mind came the memory of Boromir's assault upon him, and for a moment he hesitated. Faramir's eyes watching him grew harder. 'Boromir was a valiant member of our Company,' said Frodo at length. 'Yes, I was his friend, for my part.'\n\nFaramir smiled grimly. 'Then you would grieve to learn that Boromir is dead?'\n\n'I would grieve indeed,' said Frodo. Then catching the look in Faramir's eyes, he faltered. 'Dead?' he said. 'Do you mean that he is dead, and that you knew it? You have been trying to trap me in words, playing with me? Or are you now trying to snare me with a falsehood?'\n\n'I would not snare even an orc with a falsehood,' said Faramir.\n\n'How then did he die, and how do you know of it? Since you say that none of the Company had reached the city when you left.'\n\n'As to the manner of his death, I had hoped that his friend and companion would tell me how it was.'\n\n'But he was alive and strong when we parted. And he lives still for all that I know. Though surely there are many perils in the world.'\n\n'Many indeed,' said Faramir, 'and treachery not the least.'\n\nSam had been getting more and more impatient and angry at this conversation. These last words were more than he could bear, and bursting into the middle of the ring, he strode up to his master's side.\n\n'Begging your pardon, Mr. Frodo,' he said, 'but this has gone on long enough. He's no right to talk to you so. After all you've gone through, as much for his good and all these great Men as for anyone else.\n\n'See here, Captain!' He planted himself squarely in front of Faramir his hands on his hips, and a look on his face as if he was addressing a young hobbit who had offered him what he called 'sauce' when questioned about visits to the orchard. There was some murmuring, but also some grins on the faces of the men looking on: the sight of their Captain sitting on the ground and eye to eye with a young hobbit, legs well apart, bristling with wrath, was one beyond their experience. 'See here!' he said. 'What are you driving at? Let's come to the point before all the Orcs of Mordor come down on us! If you think my master murdered this Boromir and then ran away, you've got no sense; but say it, and have done! And then let us know what you mean to do about it. But it's a pity that folk as talk about fighting the Enemy can't let others do their bit in their own way without interfering. He'd be mighty pleased, if he could see you now. Think he'd got a new friend, he would.'\n\n'Patience!' said Faramir, but without anger. 'Do not speak before your master, whose wit is greater than yours. And I do not need any to teach me of our peril. Even so, I spare a brief time, in order to judge justly in a hard matter. Were I as hasty as you, I might have slain you long ago. For I am commanded to slay all whom I find in this land without the leave of the Lord of Gondor. But I do not slay man or beast needlessly, and not gladly even when it is needed. Neither do I talk in vain. So be comforted. Sit by your master, and be silent!'\n\nSam sat down heavily with a red face. Faramir turned to Frodo again: 'You asked how do I know that the son of Denethor is dead. Tidings of death have many wings. Night oft brings news to near kindred, 'tis said. Boromir was my brother.'\n\nA shadow of sorrow passed over his face. 'Do you remember aught of special mark that the Lord Boromir bore with him among his gear?'\n\nFrodo thought for a moment, fearing some further trap, and wondering how this debate would turn in the end. He had hardly saved the Ring from the proud grasp of Boromir, and how he would fare now among so many men, warlike and strong, he did not know. Yet he felt in his heart that Faramir, though he was much like his brother in looks, was a man less self-regarding, both sterner and wiser. 'I remember that Boromir bore a horn,' he said at last.\n\n'You remember well, and as one who has in truth seen him,' said Faramir. 'Then maybe you can see it in your mind's eye: a great horn of the wild ox of the East, bound with silver, and written with ancient characters. That horn the eldest son of our house has borne for many generations; and it is said that if it be blown at need anywhere within the bounds of Gondor, as the realm was of old, its voice will not pass unheeded.\n\n'Five days ere I set out on this venture, eleven days ago at about this hour of the day, I heard the blowing of that horn: from the northward it seemed, but dim, as if it were but an echo in the mind. A boding of ill we thought it, my father and I, for no tidings had we heard of Boromir since he went away, and no watcher on our borders had seen him pass. And on the third night after another and a stranger thing befell me.\n\n'I sat at night by the waters of Anduin, in the grey dark under the young pale moon, watching the ever-moving stream; and the sad reeds were rustling. So do we ever watch the shores nigh Osgiliath, which our enemies now partly hold, and issue from it to harry our lands. But that night all the world slept at the midnight hour. Then I saw, or it seemed that I saw, a boat floating on the water, glimmering grey, a small boat of a strange fashion with a high prow, and there was none to row or steer it.\n\n'An awe fell on me, for a pale light was round it. But I rose and went to the bank, and began to walk out into the stream, for I was drawn towards it. Then the boat turned towards me, and stayed its pace, and floated slowly by within my hand's reach, yet I durst not handle it. It waded deep, as if it were heavily burdened, and it seemed to me as it passed under my gaze that it was almost filled with clear water, from which came the light; and lapped in the water a warrior lay asleep.\n\n'A broken sword was on his knee. I saw many wounds on him. It was Boromir, my brother, dead. I knew his gear, his sword, his beloved face. One thing only I missed: his horn. One thing only I knew not: a fair belt, as it were of linked golden leaves, about his waist. Boromir! I cried. Where is thy horn? Whither goest thou? O Boromir! But he was gone. The boat turned into the stream and passed glimmering on into the night. Dreamlike it was, and yet no dream, for there was no waking. And I do not doubt that he is dead and has passed down the River to the Sea.'\n\n'Alas!' said Frodo. 'That was indeed Boromir as I knew him. For the golden belt was given to him in Lothlorien by the Lady Galadriel. She it was that clothed us as you see us, in elven-grey. This brooch is of the same workmanship.' He touched the green and silver leaf that fastened his cloak beneath his throat.\n\nFaramir looked closely at it. 'It is beautiful,' he said. 'Yes, 'tis work of the same craft. So then you passed through the Land of Lorien? Laurelindorenan it was named of old, but long now it has lain beyond the knowledge of Men,' he added softly, regarding Frodo with a new wonder in his eyes. 'Much that was strange about you I begin now to understand. Will you not tell me more? For it is a bitter thought that Boromir died, within sight of the land of his home.'\n\n'No more can I say than I have said,' answered Frodo. 'Though your tale fills me with foreboding. A vision it was that you saw, I think, and no more, some shadow of evil fortune that has been or will be. Unless indeed it is some lying trick of the Enemy. I have seen the faces of fair warriors of old laid in sleep beneath the pools of the Dead Marshes, or seeming so by his foul arts.'\n\n'Nay, it was not so,' said Faramir. 'For his works fill the heart with loathing; but my heart was filled with grief and pity.'\n\n'Yet how could such a thing have happened in truth?' asked Frodo. 'For no boat could have been carried over the stony hills from Tol Brandir; and Boromir purposed to go home across the Entwash and the fields of Rohan. And yet how could any vessel ride the foam of the great falls and not founder in the boiling pools, though laden with water?'\n\n'I know not,' said Faramir. 'But whence came the boat?'\n\n'From Lorien,' said Frodo. 'In three such boats we rowed down Anduin to the Falls. They also were of elven-work.'\n\n'You passed through the Hidden Land,' said Faramir, 'but it seems that you little understood its power. If Men have dealings with the Mistress of Magic who dwells in the Golden Wood, then they may look for strange things to follow. For it is perilous for mortal man to walk out of the world of this Sun, and few of old came thence unchanged, 'tis said.\n\n'Boromir, O Boromir!' he cried. 'What did she say to you, the Lady that dies not? What did she see? What woke in your heart then? Why went you ever to Laurelindorenan, and came not by your own road, upon the horses of Rohan riding home in the morning?'\n\nThen turning again to Frodo, he spoke in a quiet voice once more. 'To those questions I guess that you could make some answer, Frodo son of Drogo. But not here or now, maybe. But lest you still should think my tale a vision, I will tell you this. The horn of Boromir at least returned in truth, and not in seeming. The horn came, but it was cloven in two, as it were by axe or sword. The shards came severally to shore: one was found among the reeds where watchers of Gondor lay, northwards below the infalls of the Entwash; the other was found spinning on the flood by one who had an errand in the water. Strange chances, but murder will out, 'tis said.\n\n'And now the horn of the elder son lies in two pieces upon the lap of Denethor, sitting in his high chair, waiting for news. And you can tell me nothing of the cleaving of the horn?'\n\n'No, I did not know of it,' said Frodo. 'But the day when you heard it blowing, if your reckoning is true, was the day when we parted, when I and my servant left the Company. And now your tale fills me with dread. For if Boromir was then in peril and was slain, I must fear that all my companions perished too. And they were my kindred and my friends.\n\n'Will you not put aside your doubt of me and let me go? I am weary, and full of grief, and afraid. But I have a deed to do, or to attempt, before I too am slain. And the more need of haste, if we two halflings are all that remain of our fellowship.\n\n'Go back, Faramir, valiant Captain of Gondor, and defend your city while you may, and let me go where my doom takes me.'\n\n'For me there is no comfort in our speech together,' said Faramir, 'but you surely draw from it more dread than need be. Unless the people of Lorien themselves came to him, who arrayed Boromir as for a funeral? Not Orcs or servants of the Nameless. Some of your Company, I guess, live still.\n\n'But whatever befell on the North March, you, Frodo, I doubt no longer. If hard days have made me any judge of Men's words and faces, then I may make a guess at Halflings! Though,' and now he smiled, 'there is something strange about you, Frodo, an elvish air, maybe. But more lies upon our words together than I thought at first. I should now take you back to Minas Tirith to answer there to Denethor, and my life will justly be forfeit, if I now choose a course that proves ill for my city. So I will not decide in haste what is to be done. Yet we must move hence without more delay.'\n\nHe sprang to his feet and issued some orders. At once the men who were gathered round him broke up into small groups, and went off this way and that, vanishing quickly into the shadows of the rocks and trees. Soon only Mablung and Damrod remained.\n\n'Now you, Frodo and Samwise, will come with me and my guards,' said Faramir. 'You cannot go along the road southwards, if that was your purpose. It will be unsafe for some days, and always more closely watched after this affray than it has been yet. And you cannot, I think, go far today in any case, for you are weary. And so are we. We are going now to a secret place we have, somewhat less than ten miles from here. The Orcs and spies of the Enemy have not found it yet, and if they did, we could hold it long even against many. There we may lie up and rest for a while, and you with us. In the morning I will decide what is best for me to do, and for you.'\n\nThere was nothing for Frodo to do but to fall in with this request, or order. It seemed in any case a wise course for the moment, since this foray of the men of Gondor had made a journey in Ithilien more dangerous than ever.\n\nThey set out at once: Mablung and Damrod a little ahead, and Faramir with Frodo and Sam behind. Skirting the hither side of the pool where the hobbits had bathed, they crossed the stream, climbed a long bank, and passed into green-shadowed woodlands that marched ever downwards and westwards. While they walked, as swiftly as the hobbits could go, they talked in hushed voices.\n\n'I broke off our speech together,' said Faramir, 'not only because time pressed, as Master Samwise had reminded me, but also because we were drawing near to matters that were better not debated openly before many men. It was for that reason that I turned rather to the matter of my brother and let be Isildur's Bane. You were not wholly frank with me, Frodo.'\n\n'I told no lies, and of the truth all I could,' said Frodo.\n\n'I do not blame you,' said Faramir. 'You spoke with skill in a hard place, and wisely, it seemed to me. But I learned or guessed more from you than your words said. You were not friendly with Boromir, or you did not part in friendship. You, and Master Samwise, too, I guess have some grievance. Now I loved him dearly, and would gladly avenge his death, yet I knew him well. Isildur's Bane \u0426 I would hazard that Isildur's Bane lay between you and was a cause of contention in your Company. Clearly it is a mighty heirloom of some sort, and such things do not breed peace among confederates, not if aught may be learned from ancient tales. Do I not hit near the mark?'\n\n'Near,' said Frodo, 'but not in the gold. There was no contention in our Company, though there was doubt: doubt which way we should take from the Emyn Muil. But be that as it may, ancient tales teach us also the peril of rash words concerning such things as \u0426 heirlooms.'\n\n'Ah, then it is as I thought: your trouble was with Boromir alone. He wished this thing brought to Minas Tirith. Alas! it is a crooked fate that seals your lips who saw him last, and holds from me that which I long to know: what was in his heart and thought in his latest hours. Whether he erred or no, of this I am sure: he died well, achieving some good thing. His face was more beautiful even than in life.\n\n'But, Frodo, I pressed you hard at first about Isildur's Bane. Forgive me! It was unwise in such an hour and place. I had not had time for thought. We had had a hard fight, and there was more than enough to fill my mind. But even as I spoke with you, I drew nearer to the mark, and so deliberately shot wider. For you must know that much is still preserved of ancient lore among the Rulers of the city that is not spread abroad. We of my house are not of the line of Elendil, though the blood of Numenor is in us. For we reckon back our line to Mardil, the good steward, who ruled in the king's stead when he went away to war. And that was King Earnur, last of the line of Anarion, and childless, and he came never back. And the stewards have governed the city since that day, though it was many generations of Men ago.\n\n'And this I remember of Boromir as a boy, when we together learned the tale of our sires and the history of our city, that always it displeased him that his father was not king. \"How many hundreds of years needs it to make a steward a king, if the king returns not? \" he asked. \"Few years, maybe, in other places of less royalty,\" my father answered. \"In Gondor ten thousand years would not suffice.\" Alas! poor Boromir. Does that not tell you something of him?'\n\n'It does,' said Frodo. 'Yet always he treated Aragorn with honour.'\n\n'I doubt it not,' said Faramir. 'If he were satisfied of Aragorn's claim as you say, he would greatly reverence him. But the pinch has not yet come. They had not yet reached Minas Tirith or become rivals in her wars.\n\n'But I stray. We in the house of Denethor know much ancient lore by long tradition, and there are moreover in our treasuries many things preserved: books and tablets writ on withered parchments, yea, and on stone, and on leaves of silver and of gold, in divers characters. Some none can now read; and for the rest, few ever unlock them. I can read a little in them, for I have had teaching. It was these records that brought the Grey Pilgrim to us. I first saw him when I was a child, and he has been twice or thrice since then.'\n\n'The Grey Pilgrim?' said Frodo. 'Had he a name?'\n\n'Mithrandir we called him in elf-fashion,' said Faramir, 'and he was content. Many are my names in many countries, he said. Mithrandir among the Elves; Tharkun to the Dwarves; Olorin I was in my youth in the West that is forgotten, in the South Incanus; in the North Gandalf; to the East I go not. '\n\n'Gandalf!' said Frodo. 'I thought it was he. Gandalf the Grey dearest of counsellors. Leader of our Company. He was lost in Moria.'\n\n'Mithrandir was lost!' said Faramir. 'An evil fate seems to have pursued your fellowship. It is hard indeed to believe that one of so great wisdom, and of power \u0426 for many wonderful things he did among us \u0426 could perish, and so much lore be taken from the world. Are you sure of this, and that he did not just leave you and depart where he would?'\n\n'Alas! yes,' said Frodo. 'I saw him fall into the abyss.'\n\n'I see that there is some great tale of dread in this,' said Faramir, 'which perhaps you may tell me in the evening-time. This Mithrandir was, I now guess, more than a lore-master: a great mover of the deeds that are done in our time. Had he been among us to consult concerning the hard words of our dream, he could have made them clear to us without need of messenger. Yet, maybe, he would not have done so, and the journey of Boromir was doomed. Mithrandir never spoke to us of what was to be, nor did he reveal his purposes. He got leave of Denethor, how I do not know, to look at the secrets of our treasury, and I learned a little of him, when he would teach (and that was seldom). Ever he would search and would question us above all else concerning the Great Battle that was fought upon Dagorlad in the beginning of Gondor, when He whom we do not name was overthrown. And he was eager for stories of Isildur, though of him we had less to tell; for nothing certain was ever known among us of his end.'\n\nNow Faramir's voice sank to a whisper. 'But this much I learned or guessed, and I have kept it ever secret in my heart since: that Isildur took somewhat from the hand of the Unnamed, ere he went away from Gondor, never to be seen among mortal men again. Here I thought was the answer to Mithrandir's questioning. But it seemed then a matter that concerned only the seekers after ancient learning. Nor when the riddling words of our dream were debated among us, did I think of Isildur's Bane as being this same thing. For Isildur was ambushed and slain by orc-arrows, according to the only legend that we knew, and Mithrandir had never told me more.\n\n'What in truth this Thing is I cannot yet guess; but some heirloom of power and peril it must be. A fell weapon, perchance, devised by the Dark Lord. If it were a thing that gave advantage in battle. I can well believe that Boromir, the proud and fearless, often rash, ever anxious for the victory of Minas Tirith (and his own glory therein), might desire such a thing and be allured by it. Alas that ever he went on that errand! I should have been chosen by my father and the elders but he put himself forward, as being the older and the hardier (both true), and he would not be stayed.\n\n'But fear no more! I would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway. Not were Minas Tirith falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and my glory. No. I do not wish for such triumphs, Frodo son of Drogo.'\n\n'Neither did the Council,' said Frodo. 'Nor do I. I would have nothing to do with such matters.'\n\n'For myself,' said Faramir, 'I would see the White Tree in flower again in the courts of the kings, and the Silver Crown return, and Minas Tirith in peace: Minas Anor again as of old, full of light, high and fair, beautiful as a queen among other queens: not a mistress of many slaves, nay, not even a kind mistress of willing slaves. War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend: the city of the Men of Numenor; and I would have her loved for her memory, her ancientry, her beauty, and her present wisdom. Not feared, save as men may fear the dignity of a man, old and wise.\n\n'So fear me not! I do not ask you to tell me more. I do not even ask you to tell me whether I now speak nearer the mark. But if you will trust me, it may be that I can advise you in your present quest, whatever that be \u0426 yes, and even aid you.'\n\nFrodo made no answer. Almost he yielded to the desire for help and counsel, to tell this grave young man, whose words seemed so wise and fair, all that was in his mind. But something held him back. His heart was heavy with fear and sorrow: if he and Sam were indeed, as seemed likely, all that was now left of the Nine Walkers, then he was in sole command of the secret of their errand. Better mistrust undeserved than rash words. And the memory of Boromir, of the dreadful change that the lure of the Ring had worked in him, was very present to his mind, when he looked at Faramir and listened to his voice: unlike they were, and yet also much akin.\n\nThey walked on in silence for a while, passing like grey and green shadows under the old trees, their feet making no sound; above them many birds sang, and the sun glistened on the polished roof of dark leaves in the evergreen woods of Ithilien.\n\nSam had taken no part in the conversation, though he had listened; and at the same time he had attended with his keen hobbit ears to all the soft woodland noises about them. One thing he had noted, that in all the talk the name of Gollum had not once come up. He was glad, though he felt that it was too much to hope that he would never hear it again. He soon became aware also that though they walked alone, there were many men close at hand: not only Damrod and Mablung flitting in and out of the shadows ahead, but others on either side, all making their swift secret way to some appointed place.\n\nOnce, looking suddenly back, as if some prickle of the skin told him that he was watched from behind, he thought he caught a brief glimpse of a small dark shape slipping behind a tree-trunk. He opened his mouth to speak and shut it again. 'I'm not sure of it,' he said to himself, 'and why should I remind them of the old villain, if they choose to forget him? I wish I could!'\n\nSo they passed on, until the woodlands grew thinner and the land began to fall more steeply. Then they turned aside again, to the right, and came quickly to a small river in a narrow gorge: it was the same stream that trickled far above out of the round pool, now grown to a swift torrent, leaping down over many stones in a deep-cloven bed, overhung with ilex and dark box-woods. Looking west they could see, below them in a haze of light, lowlands and broad meads, and glinting far off in the westering sun the wide waters of the Anduin.\n\n'Here, alas! I must do you a discourtesy,' said Faramir. 'I hope you will pardon it to one who has so far made his orders give way to courtesy as not to slay you or to bind you. But it is a command that no stranger, not even one of Rohan that fights with us, shall see the path we now go with open eyes. I must blindfold you.'\n\n'As you will,' said Frodo. 'Even the Elves do likewise at need, and blindfolded we crossed the borders of fair Lothlorien. Gimli the dwarf took it ill, but the hobbits endured it.'\n\n'It is to no place so fair that I shall lead you,' said Faramir. 'But I am glad that you will take this willingly and not by force.'\n\nHe called softly and immediately Mablung and Damrod stepped out of the trees and came back to him. 'Blindfold these guests,' said Faramir. 'Securely, but not so as to discomfort them. Do not tie their hands. They will give their word not to try and see. I could trust them to shut their eyes of their own accord, but eyes will blink, if the feet stumble. Lead them so that they do not falter.'\n\nWith green scarves the two guards now bound up the hobbits' eyes and drew their hoods down almost to their mouths; then quickly they took each one by the hand and went on their way. All that Frodo and Sam knew of this last mile of the road they learned from guessing in the dark. After a little they found that they were on a path descending steeply; soon it grew so narrow that they went in single file, brushing a stony wall on either side; their guards steered them from behind with hands laid firmly on their shoulders. Now and again they came to rough places and were lifted from their feet for a while, and then set down again. Always the noise of the running water was on their right hand, and it grew nearer and louder. At length they were halted. Quickly Mablung and Damrod turned them about, several times, and they lost all sense of direction. They climbed upwards a little: it seemed cold and the noise of the stream had become faint. Then they were picked up and carried down, down many steps, and round a corner. Suddenly they heard the water again, loud now, rushing and splashing. All round them it seemed, and they felt a fine rain on their hands and cheeks. At last they were set on their feet once more. For a moment they stood so, half fearful, blindfold, not knowing where they were; and no one spoke.\n\nThen came the voice of Faramir close behind. 'Let them see!' he said. The scarves were removed and their hoods drawn back, and they blinked and gasped.\n\nThey stood on a wet floor of polished stone, the doorstep, as it were, of a rough-hewn gate of rock opening dark behind them. But in front a thin veil of water was hung, so near that Frodo could have put an outstretched arm into it. It faced westward. The level shafts of the setting sun behind beat upon it, and the red light was broken into many flickering beams of ever-changing colour. It was as if they stood at the window of some elven-tower, curtained with threaded jewels of silver and gold, and ruby, sapphire and amethyst, all kindled with an unconsuming fire.\n\n'At least by good chance we came at the right hour to reward you for your patience,' said Faramir. 'This is the Window of the Sunset, Henneth Annun, fairest of all the falls of Ithilien, land of many fountains. Few strangers have ever seen it. But there is no kingly hall behind to match it. Enter now and see!'\n\nEven as he spoke the sun sank, and the fire faded in the flowing water. They turned and passed under the low forbidding arch. At once they found themselves in a rock-chamber, wide and rough, with an uneven stooping roof. A few torches were kindled and cast a dim light on the glistening walls. Many men were already there. Others were still coming in by twos and threes through a dark narrow door on one side. As their eyes grew accustomed to the gloom the hobbits saw that the cave was larger than they had guessed and was filled with great store of arms and victuals.\n\n'Well, here is our refuge,' said Faramir. 'Not a place of great ease but here you may pass the night in peace. It is dry at least, and there is food, though no fire. At one time the water flowed down through this cave and out of the arch, but its course was changed further up the gorge, by workmen of old, and the stream sent down in a fall of doubled height over the rocks far above. All the ways into this grot were then sealed against the entry of water or aught else, all save one. There are now but two ways out: that passage yonder by which you entered blindfold, and through the Window-curtain into a deep bowl filled with knives of stone. Now rest a while, until the evening meal is set.'\n\nThe hobbits were taken to a corner and given a low bed to lie on, if they wished. Meanwhile men busied themselves about the cave, quietly and in orderly quickness. Light tables were taken from the walls and set up on trestles and laden with gear. This was plain and unadorned for the most part, but all well and fairly, made: round platters, bowls and dishes of glazed brown clay or turned box-wood, smooth and clean. Here and there was a cup or basin of polished bronze; and a goblet of plain silver was set by the Captain's seat in the middle of the inmost table.\n\nFaramir went about among the men, questioning each as he came in, in a soft voice. Some came back from the pursuit of the Southrons; others, left behind as scouts near the road, came in latest. All the Southrons had been accounted for, save only the great mumak: what happened to him none could say. Of the enemy no movement could be seen; not even an orc-spy was abroad.\n\n'You saw and heard nothing, Anborn?' Faramir asked of the latest comer.\n\n'Well, no, lord,' said the man. 'No Orc at least. But I saw, or thought I saw, something a little strange. It was getting deep dusk, when the eyes make things greater than they should be. So perhaps it may have been no more than a squirrel.' Sam pricked up his ears at this. 'Yet if so, it was a black squirrel, and I saw no tail. 'Twas like a shadow on the ground, and it whisked behind a tree-trunk when I drew nigh and went up aloft as swift as any squirrel could. You will not have us slay wild beasts for no purpose, and it seemed no more, so I tried no arrow. It was too dark for sure shooting anyway, and the creature was gone into the gloom of the leaves in a twinkling. But I stayed for a while, for it seemed strange, and then I hastened back. I thought I heard the thing hiss at me from high above as I turned away. A large squirrel, maybe. Perhaps under the shadow of the Unnamed some of the beasts of Mirkwood are wandering hither to our woods. They have black squirrels there, 'tis said.'\n\n'Perhaps,' said Faramir. 'But that would be an ill omen, if it were so. We do not want the escapes of Mirkwood in Ithilien.' Sam fancied that he gave a swift glance towards the hobbits as he spoke; but Sam said nothing. For a while he and Frodo lay back and watched the torchlight, and the men moving to and fro speaking in hushed voices. Then suddenly Frodo fell asleep.\n\nSam struggled with himself, arguing this way and that. 'He may be all right,' he thought, 'and then he may not. Fair speech may hide a foul heart.' He yawned. 'I could sleep for a week, and I'd be better for it. And what can I do, if I do keep awake, me all alone, and all these great Men about? Nothing, Sam Gamgee; but you've got to keep awake all the same.' And somehow he managed it. The light faded from the cave door, and the grey veil of falling water grew dim and was lost in gathering shadow. Always the sound of the water went on, never changing its note, morning or evening or night. It murmured and whispered of sleep. Sam stuck his knuckles in his eyes.\n\nNow more torches were being lit. A cask of wine was broached. Storage barrels were being opened. Men were fetching water from the fall. Some were laving their hands in basins. A wide copper bowl and a white cloth were brought to Faramir and he washed.\n\n'Wake our guests,' he said, 'and take them water. It is time to eat.'\n\nFrodo sat up and yawned and stretched. Sam, not used to being waited on, looked with some surprise at the tall man who bowed, holding a basin of water before him.\n\n'Put it on the ground, master, if you please!' he said. 'Easier for me and you.' Then to the astonishment and amusement of the Men he plunged his head into the cold water and splashed his neck and ears.\n\n'Is it the custom in your land to wash the head before supper?' said the man who waited on the hobbits.\n\n'No, before breakfast,' said Sam. 'But if you're short of sleep cold water on the neck's like rain on a wilted lettuce. There! Now I can keep awake long enough to eat a bit.'\n\nThey were led then to seats beside Faramir: barrels covered with pelts and high enough above the benches of the Men for their convenience. Before they ate, Faramir and all his men turned and faced west in a moment of silence. Faramir signed to Frodo and Sam that they should do likewise.\n\n'So we always do,' he said, as they sat down, 'we look towards Numenor that was, and beyond to Elvenhome that is, and to that which is beyond Elvenhome and will ever be. Have you no such custom at meat?'\n\n'No,' said Frodo, feeling strangely rustic and untutored. 'But if we are guests, we bow to our host, and after we have eaten we rise and thank him.'\n\n'That we do also,' said Faramir.\n\nAfter so long journeying and camping, and days spent in the lonely wild, the evening meal seemed a feast to the hobbits: to drink pale yellow wine, cool and fragrant, and eat bread and butter, and salted meats, and dried fruits, and good red cheese, with clean hands and clean knives and plates. Neither Frodo nor Sam refused anything that was offered, nor a second, nor indeed a third helping. The wine coursed in their veins and tired limbs, and they felt glad and easy of heart as they had not done since they left the land of Lorien.\n\nWhen all was done Faramir led them to a recess at the back of the cave, partly screened by curtains; and a chair and two stools were brought there. A little earthenware lamp burned in a niche.\n\n'You may soon desire to sleep,' he said, 'and especially good Samwise, who would not close his eyes before he ate \u0426 whether for fear of blunting the edge of a noble hunger, or for fear of me, I do not know. But it is not good to sleep too soon after meat, and that following a fast. Let us talk a while. On your journey from Rivendell there must have been many things to tell. And you, too, would perhaps wish to learn something of us and the lands where you now are. Tell me of Boromir my brother, and of old Mithrandir, and of the fair people of Lothlorien.'\n\nFrodo no longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk. But though the food and wine had put him at his ease, he had not lost all his caution. Sam was beaming and humming to himself, but when Frodo spoke he was at first content to listen, only occasionally venturing to make an exclamation of agreement.\n\nFrodo told many tales, yet always he steered the matter away from the quest of the Company and from the Ring, enlarging rather on the valiant part Boromir had played in all their adventures: with the wolves of the wild, in the snows under Caradhras, and in the mines of Moria where Gandalf fell. Faramir was most moved by the story of the fight on the bridge.\n\n'It must have irked Boromir to run from Orcs,' he said, 'or even from the fell thing you name, the Balrog \u0426 even though he was the last to leave.'\n\n'He was the last,' said Frodo, 'but Aragorn was forced to lead us. He alone knew the way after Gandalf's fall. But had there not been us lesser folk to care for, I do not think that either he or Boromir would have fled.'\n\n'Maybe, it would have been better had Boromir fallen there with Mithrandir,' said Faramir, 'and not gone on to the fate that waited above the falls of Rauros.'\n\n'Maybe. But tell me now of your own fortunes,' said Frodo, turning the matter aside once again. 'For I would learn more of Minas Ithil and Osgiliath, and Minas Tirith the long-enduring. What hope have you for that city in your long war?'\n\n'What hope have we?' said Faramir. 'It is long since we had any hope. The sword of Elendil, if it returns indeed, may rekindle it, but I do not think that it will do more than put off the evil day, unless other help unlooked-for also comes, from Elves or Men. For the Enemy increases and we decrease. We are a failing people, a springless autumn.\n\n'The Men of Numenor were settled far and wide on the shores and seaward regions of the Great Lands, but for the most part they fell into evils and follies. Many became enamoured of the Darkness and the black arts; some were given over wholly to idleness and ease, and some fought among themselves, until they were conquered in their weakness by the wild men.\n\n'It is not said that evil arts were ever practised in Gondor, or that the Nameless One was ever named in honour there; and the old wisdom and beauty brought out of the West remained long in the realm of the sons of Elendil the Fair, and they linger there still. Yet even so it was Gondor that brought about its own decay, falling by degrees into dotage, and thinking that the Enemy was asleep, who was only banished not destroyed.\n\n'Death was ever present, because the Numenoreans still, as they had in their old kingdom, and so lost it, hungered after endless life unchanging. Kings made tombs more splendid than houses of the living, and counted old names in the rolls of their descent dearer than the names of sons. Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry; in secret chambers withered men compounded strong elixirs, or in high cold towers asked questions of the stars. And the last king of the line of Anarion had no heir.\n\n'But the stewards were wiser and more fortunate. Wiser, for they recruited the strength of our people from the sturdy folk of the sea-coast, and from the hardy mountaineers of Ered Nimrais. And they made a truce with the proud peoples of the North, who often had assailed us, men of fierce valour, but our kin from afar off, unlike the wild Easterlings or the cruel Haradrim.\n\n'So it came to pass in the days of Cirion the Twelfth Steward (and my father is the sit and twentieth) that they rode to our aid and at the great Field of Celebrant they destroyed our enemies that had seized our northern provinces. These are the Rohirrim, as we name them, masters of horses, and we ceded to them the fields of Calenardhon that are since called Rohan; for that province had long been sparsely peopled. And they became our allies, and have ever proved true to us, aiding us at need, and guarding our northern marches and the Gap of Rohan.\n\n'Of our lore and manners they have learned what they would, and their lords speak our speech at need; yet for the most part they hold by the ways of their own fathers and to their own memories, and they speak among themselves their own North tongue. And we love them: tall men and fair women, valiant both alike, golden-haired, bright-eyed, and strong; they remind us of the youth of Men, as they were in the Elder Days. Indeed it is said by our lore-masters that they have from of old this affinity with us that they are come from those same Three Houses of Men as were the Numenoreans in their beginning not from Hador the Goldenhaired, the Elf-friend, maybe, yet from such of his sons and people as went not over Sea into the West, refusing the call.\n\n'For so we reckon Men in our lore, calling them the High, or Men of the West, which were Numenoreans; and the Middle Peoples, Men of the Twilight, such as are the Rohirrim and their kin that dwell still far in the North; and the Wild, the Men of Darkness.\n\n'Yet now, if the Rohirrim are grown in some ways more like to us, enhanced in arts and gentleness, we too have become more like to them, and can scarce claim any longer the title High. We are become Middle Men, of the Twilight, but with memory of other things. For as the Rohirrim do, we now love war and valour as things good in themselves, both a sport and an end; and though we still hold that a warrior should have more skills and knowledge than only the craft of weapons and slaying, we esteem a warrior, nonetheless, above men of other crafts. Such is the need of our days. So even was my brother, Boromir: a man of prowess, and for that he was accounted the best man in Gondor. And very valiant indeed he was: no heir of Minas Tirith has for long years been so hardy in toil, so onward into battle, or blown a mightier note on the Great Horn.' Faramir sighed and fell silent for a while.\n\n'You don't say much in all your tales about the Elves, sir,' said Sam, suddenly plucking up courage. He had noted that Faramir seemed to refer to Elves with reverence, and this even more than his courtesy, and his food and wine, had won Sam's respect and quieted his suspicions.\n\n'No indeed, Master Samwise,' said Faramir, 'for I am not learned in Elven-lore. But there you touch upon another point in which we have changed, declining from Numenor to Middle-earth. For as you may know, if Mithrandir was your companion and you have spoken with Elrond, the Edain, the Fathers of the Numenoreans, fought beside the Elves in the first wars, and were rewarded by the gift of the kingdom in the midst of the Sea, within sight of Elvenhome. But in Middle-earth Men and Elves became estranged in the days of darkness, by the arts of the Enemy, and by the slow changes of time in which each kind walked further down their sundered roads. Men now fear and misdoubt the Elves, and yet know little of them. And we of Gondor grow like other Men, like the men of Rohan; for even they, who are the foes of the Dark Lord, shun the Elves and speak of the Golden Wood with dread.\n\n'Yet there are among us still some who have dealings with the Elves when they may, and ever and anon one will go in secret to Lorien, seldom to return. Not I. For I deem it perilous now for mortal man wilfully to seek out the Elder People. Yet I envy you that have spoken with the White Lady.'\n\n'The Lady of Lorien! Galadriel!' cried Sam. 'You should see her indeed you should, sir. I am only a hobbit, and gardening's my job at home, sir, if you understand me, and I'm not much good at poetry \u0426 not at making it: a bit of a comic rhyme, perhaps, now and again, you know, but not real poetry \u0426 so I can't tell you what I mean. It ought to be sung. You'd have to get Strider, Aragorn that is, or old Mr. Bilbo, for that. But I wish I could make a song about her. Beautiful she is, sir! Lovely! Sometimes like a great tree in flower, sometimes like a white daffadowndilly, small and slender like. Hard as diamonds, soft as moonlight. Warm as sunlight, cold as frost in the stars. Proud and far-off as a snow-mountain, and as merry as any lass I ever saw with daisies in her hair in springtime. But that's a lot o' nonsense, and all wide of my mark.'\n\n'Then she must be lovely indeed,' said Faramir. 'Perilously fair.'\n\n'I don't know about perilous,' said Sam. 'It strikes me that folk takes their peril with them into Lorien, and finds it there because they've brought it. But perhaps you could call her perilous, because she's so strong in herself. You, you could dash yourself to pieces on her, like a ship on a rock; or drownd yourself, like a hobbit in a river. But neither rock nor river would be to blame. Now Boro \u0426' He stopped and went red in the face.\n\n'Yes? Now Boromir you would say?' said Faramir. 'What would you say? He took his peril with him?'\n\n'Yes sir, begging your pardon, and a fine man as your brother was if I may say so. But you've been warm on the scent all along. Now I watched Boromir and listened to him, from Rivendell all down the road \u0426 looking after my master, as you'll understand, and not meaning any harm to Boromir \u0426 and it's my opinion that in Lorien he first saw clearly what I guessed sooner: what he wanted. From the moment he first saw it he wanted the Enemy's Ring!'\n\n'Sam!' cried Frodo aghast. He had fallen deep into his own thoughts for a while, and came out of them suddenly and too late.\n\n'Save me!' said Sam turning white, and then flushing scarlet. 'There I go again! When ever you open your big mouth you put your foot in it the Gaffer used to say to me, and right enough. O dear, O dear!\n\n'Now look here, sir!' He turned, facing up to Faramir with all the courage that he could muster. 'Don't you go taking advantage of my master because his servant's no better than a fool. You've spoken very handsome all along, put me off my guard, talking of Elves and all. But handsome is as handsome does we say. Now's a chance to show your quality.'\n\n'So it seems,' said Faramir, slowly and very softly, with a strange smile. 'So that is the answer to all the riddles! The One Ring that was thought to have perished from the world. And Boromir tried to take it by force? And you escaped? And ran all the way \u0426 to me! And here in the wild I have you: two halflings, and a host of men at my call, and the Ring of Rings. A pretty stroke of fortune! A chance for Faramir, Captain of Gondor, to show his quality! Ha!' He stood up, very tall and stern, his grey eyes glinting.\n\nFrodo and Sam sprang from their stools and set themselves side by side with their backs to the wall, fumbling for their sword-hilts. There was a silence. All the men in the cave stopped talking and looked towards them in wonder. But Faramir sat down again in his chair and began to laugh quietly, and then suddenly became grave again.\n\n'Alas for Boromir! It was too sore a trial!' he said. 'How you have increased my sorrow, you two strange wanderers from a far country, bearing the peril of Men! But you are less judges of Men than I of Halflings. We are truth-speakers, we men of Gondor. We boast seldom, and then perform, or die in the attempt. Not if I found it on the highway would I take it I said. Even if I were such a man as to desire this thing, and even though I knew not clearly what this thing was when I spoke, still I should take those words as a vow, and be held by them.\n\n'But I am not such a man. Or I am wise enough to know that there are some perils from which a man must flee. Sit at peace! And be comforted, Samwise. If you seem to have stumbled, think that it was fated to be so. Your heart is shrewd as well as faithful, and saw clearer than your eyes. For strange though it may seem, it was safe to declare this to me. It may even help the master that you love. It shall turn to his good, if it is in my power. So be comforted. But do not even name this thing again aloud. Once is enough.'\n\nThe hobbits came back to their seats and sat very quiet. Men turned back to their drink and their talk, perceiving that their captain had had some jest or other with the little guests, and that it was over.\n\n'Well, Frodo, now at last we understand one another,' said Faramir. 'If you took this thing on yourself, unwilling, at others' asking, then you have pity and honour from me. And I marvel at you: to keep it hid and not to use it. You are a new people and a new world to me. Are all your kin of like sort? Your land must be a realm of peace and content, and there must gardeners be in high honour.'\n\n'Not all is well there,' said Frodo, 'but certainly gardeners are honoured.'\n\n'But folk must grow weary there, even in their gardens, as do all things under the Sun of this world. And you are far from home and wayworn. No more tonight. Sleep, both of you \u0426 in peace, if you can. Fear not! I do not wish to see it, or touch it, or know more of it than I know (which is enough), lest peril perchance waylay me and I fall lower in the test than Frodo son of Drogo. Go now to rest \u0426 but first tell me only, if you will, whither you wish to go, and what to do. For I must watch, and wait, and think. Time passes. In the morning we must each go swiftly on the ways appointed to us.'\n\nFrodo had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed. Now a great weariness came down on him like a cloud. He could dissemble and resist no longer.\n\n'I was going to find a way into Mordor,' he said faintly. 'I was going to Gorgoroth. I must find the Mountain of Fire and cast the thing into the gulf of Doom. Gandalf said so. I do not think I shall ever get there.'\n\nFaramir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment. Then suddenly he caught him as he swayed, and lifting him gently, carried him to the bed and laid him there, and covered him warmly. At once he fell into a deep sleep.\n\nAnother bed was set beside him for his servant. Sam hesitated for a moment, then bowing very low: 'Good night, Captain, my lord,' he said. 'You took the chance, sir.'\n\n'Did I so?' said Faramir.\n\n'Yes sir, and showed your quality: the very highest.'\n\nFaramir smiled. 'A pert servant, Master Samwise. But nay: the praise of the praiseworthy is above all rewards. Yet there was naught in this to praise. I had no lure or desire to do other than I have done.'\n\n'Ah well, sir,' said Sam, 'you said my master had an elvish air and that was good and true. But I can say this: you have an air too, sir, that reminds me of, of \u0426 well, Gandalf, of wizards.\n\n'Maybe,' said Faramir. 'Maybe you discern from far away the air of Numenor. Good night!'\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nThe Forbidden Pool\n\nFrodo woke to find Faramir bending over him. For a second old fears seized him and he sat up and shrank away.\n\n'There is nothing to fear,' said Faramir.\n\n'Is it morning already?' said Frodo yawning.\n\n'Not yet, but night is drawing to an end, and the full moon is setting. Will you come and see it? Also there is a matter on which I desire your counsel. I am sorry to rouse you from sleep, but will you come?'\n\n'I will,' said Frodo, rising and shivering a little as he left the warm blanket and pelts. It seemed cold in the fireless cave. The noise of the water was loud in the stillness. He put on his cloak and followed Faramir.\n\nSam, waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfulness, saw first his master's empty bed and leapt to his feet. Then he saw two dark figures, Frodo and a man, framed against the archway, which was now filled with a pale white light. He hurried after them, past rows of men sleeping on mattresses along the wall. As he went by the cave-mouth he saw that the Curtain was now become a dazzling veil of silk and pearls and silver thread: melting icicles of moonlight. But he did not pause to admire it, and turning aside he followed his master through the narrow doorway in the wall of the cave.\n\nThey went first along a black passage, then up many wet steps, and so came to a small flat landing cut in the stone and lit by the pale sky, gleaming high above through a long deep shaft. From here two flights of steps led: one going on, as it seemed, up on to the high bank of the stream; the other turning away to the left. This they followed. It wound its way up like a turret-stair.\n\nAt last they came out of the stony darkness and looked about. They were on a wide flat rock without rail or parapet. At their right, eastwards, the torrent fell, splashing over many terraces, and then, pouring down a steep race, it filled a smooth-hewn channel with a dark force of water flecked with foam, and curling and rushing almost at their feet it plunged sheer over the edge that yawned upon their left. A man stood there, near the brink, silent, gazing down.\n\nFrodo turned to watch the sleek necks of the water as they curved and dived. Then he lifted his eyes and gazed far away. The world was quiet and cold, as if dawn were near. Far off in the West the full moon was sinking, round and white. Pale mists shimmered in the great vale below: a wide gulf of silver fume, beneath which rolled the cool night-waters of the Anduin. A black darkness loomed beyond, and in it glinted, here and there, cold, sharp, remote, white as the teeth of ghosts, the peaks of Ered Nimrais, the White Mountains of the Realm of Gondor, tipped with everlasting snow.\n\nFor a while Frodo stood there on the high stone, and a shiver ran through him, wondering if anywhere in the vastness of the night-lands his old companions walked or slept, or lay dead shrouded in mist. Why was he brought here out of forgetful sleep?\n\nSam was eager for an answer to the same question and could not refrain himself from muttering, for his master's ear alone as he thought: 'It's a fine view, no doubt, Mr. Frodo, but chilly to the heart, not to mention the bones! What's going on?'\n\nFaramir heard and answered. 'Moonset over Gondor. Fair Ithil as he goes from Middle-earth, glances upon the white locks of old Mindolluin. It is worth a few shivers. But that is not what I brought you to see \u0426 though as for you, Samwise, you were not brought, and do but pay the penalty of your watchfulness. A draught of wine shall amend it. Come, look now!'\n\nHe stepped up beside the silent sentinel on the dark edge, and Frodo followed. Sam hung back. He already felt insecure enough on this high wet platform. Faramir and Frodo looked down. Far below them they saw the white waters pour into a foaming bowl, and then swirl darkly about a deep oval basin in the rocks, until they found their way out again through a narrow gate, and flowed away, fuming and chattering, into calmer and more level reaches. The moonlight still slanted down to the fall's foot and gleamed on the ripples of the basin. Presently Frodo was aware of a small dark thing on the near bank, but even as he looked at it, it dived and vanished just beyond the boil and bubble of the fall, cleaving the black water as neatly as an arrow or an edgewise stone.\n\nFaramir turned to the man at his side. 'Now what would you say that it is, Anborn? A squirrel, or a kingfisher? Are there black kingfishers in the night-pools of Mirkwood?'\n\n''Tis not a bird, whatever else it be,' answered Anborn. 'It has four limbs and dives manwise; a pretty mastery of the craft it shows, too. What is it at? Seeking a way up behind the Curtain to our hidings? It seems we are discovered at last. I have my bow here, and I have posted other archers, nigh as good marksmen as myself, on either bank. We wait only for your command to shoot, Captain.'\n\n'Shall we shoot?' said Faramir, turning quickly to Frodo.\n\nFrodo did not answer for a moment. Then 'No!' he said. 'No! I beg you not to.' If Sam had dared, he would have said 'Yes,' quicker and louder. He could not see, but he guessed well enough from their words what they were looking at.\n\n'You know, then, what this thing is?' said Faramir. 'Come, now you have seen, tell me why it should be spared. In all our words together you have not once spoken of your gangrel companion, and I let him be for the time. He could wait till he was caught and brought before me. I sent my keenest huntsmen to seek him, but he slipped them, and they had no sight of him till now, save Anborn here, once at dusk yesterevening. But now he has done worse trespass than only to go coney-snaring in the uplands: he has dared to come to Henneth Annun, and his life is forfeit. I marvel at the creature: so secret and so sly as he is, to come sporting in the pool before our very window. Does he think that men sleep without watch all night? Why does he so?'\n\n'There are two answers, I think,' said Frodo. 'For one thing, he knows little of Men, and sly though he is, your refuge is so hidden that perhaps he does not know that Men are concealed here. For another, I think he is allured here by a mastering desire, stronger than his caution.'\n\n'He is lured here, you say?' said Faramir in a low voice. 'Can he, does he then know of your burden?'\n\n'Indeed yes. He bore it himself for many years.'\n\n'He bore it?' said Faramir, breathing sharply in his wonder. 'This matter winds itself ever in new riddles. Then he is pursuing it?'\n\n'Maybe. It is precious to him. But I did not speak of that.'\n\n'What then does the creature seek?'\n\n'Fish,' said Frodo. 'Look!'\n\nThey peered down at the dark pool. A little black head appeared at the far end of the basin, just out of the deep shadow of the rocks. There was a brief silver glint, and a swirl of tiny ripples. It swam to the side, and then with marvellous agility a froglike figure climbed out of the water and up the bank. At once it sat down and began to gnaw at the small silver thing that glittered as it turned: the last rays of the moon were now falling behind the stony wall at the pool's end.\n\nFaramir laughed softly. 'Fish!' he said. 'It is a less perilous hunger. Or maybe not: fish from the pool of Henneth Annun may cost him all he has to give.'\n\n'Now I have him at the arrow-point,' said Anborn. 'Shall I not shoot, Captain? For coming unbidden to this place death is our law.'\n\n'Wait, Anborn,' said Faramir. 'This is a harder matter than it seems. What have you to say now, Frodo? Why should we spare?'\n\n'The creature is wretched and hungry,' said Frodo, 'and unaware of his danger. And Gandalf, your Mithrandir, he would have bidden you not to slay him for that reason, and for others. He forbade the Elves to do so. I do not know clearly why, and of what I guess I cannot speak openly out here. But this creature is in some way bound up with my errand. Until you found us and took us, he was my guide.'\n\n'Your guide!' said Faramir. 'The matter becomes ever stranger. I would do much for you, Frodo, but this I cannot grant: to let this sly wanderer go free at his own will from here, to join you later if it please him, or to be caught by Orcs and tell all he knows under threat of pain. He must be slain or taken. Slain, if he be not taken very swiftly. But how can this slippery thing of many guises be caught, save by a feathered shaft?'\n\n'Let me go down quietly to him,' said Frodo. 'You may keep your bows bent, and shoot me at least, if I fail. I shall not run away.'\n\n'Go then and be swift!' said Faramir. 'If he comes off alive, he should be your faithful servant for the rest of his unhappy days. Lead Frodo down to the bank, Anborn, and go softly. The thing has a nose and ears. Give me your bow.'\n\nAnborn grunted and led the way down the winding stair to the landing, and then up the other stair, until at last they came to a narrow opening shrouded with thick bushes. Passing silently through, Frodo found himself on the top of the southern bank above the pool. It was now dark and the falls were pale and grey, reflecting only the lingering moonlight of the western sky. He could not see Gollum. He went forward a short way and Anborn came softly behind him.\n\n'Go on!' he breathed in Frodo's ear. 'Have a care to your right. If you fall in the pool, then no one but your fishing friend can help you. And forget not that there are bowmen near at hand, though you may not see them.'\n\nFrodo crept forward, using his hands Gollum-like to feel his way and to steady himself. The rocks were for the most part flat and smooth but slippery. He halted listening. At first he could hear no sound but the unceasing rush of the fall behind him. Then presently he heard, not far ahead, a hissing murmur.\n\n'Fissh, nice fissh. White Face has vanished, my precious, at last, yes. Now we can eat fish in peace. No, not in peace, precious. For Precious is lost; yes, lost. Dirty hobbits, nasty hobbits. Gone and left us, gollum; and Precious is gone. Only poor Smeagol all alone. No Precious. Nasty Men, they'll take it, steal my Precious. Thieves. We hates them. Fissh, nice fissh: Makes us strong. Makes eyes bright, fingers tight, yes. Throttle them, precious. Throttle them all, yes, if we gets chances. Nice fissh. Nice fissh!'\n\nSo it went on, almost as unceasing as the waterfall, only interrupted by a faint noise of slavering and gurgling. Frodo shivered, listening with pity and disgust. He wished it would stop, and that he never need hear that voice again. Anborn was not far behind. He could creep back and ask him to get the huntsmen to shoot. They would probably get close enough, while Gollum was gorging and off his guard. Only one true shot, and Frodo would be rid of the miserable voice for ever. But no, Gollum had a claim on him now. The servant has a claim on the master for service, even service in fear. They would have foundered in the Dead Marshes but for Gollum. Frodo knew, too, somehow, quite clearly that Gandalf would not have wished it.\n\n'Smeagol!' he said softly.\n\n'Fissh, nice fissh,' said the voice.\n\n'Smeagol!' he said, a little louder. The voice stopped.\n\n'Smeagol, Master has come to look for you. Master is here. Come, Smeagol!' There was no answer but a soft hiss, as of intaken breath.\n\n'Come, Smeagol!' said Frodo. 'We are in danger. Men will kill you, if they find you here. Come quickly, if you wish to escape death. Come to Master!'\n\n'No!' said the voice. 'Not nice Master. Leaves poor Smeagol and goes with new friends. Master can wait. Smeagol hasn't finished.'\n\n'There's no time,' said Frodo. 'Bring fish with you. Come!'\n\n'No! Must finish fish.'\n\n'Smeagol!' said Frodo desperately. 'Precious will be angry. I shall take Precious, and I shall say: make him swallow the bones and choke. Never taste fish again. Come, Precious is waiting!'\n\nThere was a sharp hiss. Presently out of the darkness Gollum came crawling on all fours, like an erring dog called to heel. He had a half-eaten fish in his mouth and another in his hand. He came close to Frodo, almost nose to nose, and sniffed at him. His pale eyes were shining. Then he took the fish out of his mouth and stood up.\n\n'Nice Master!' he whispered. 'Nice hobbit, come back to poor Smeagol. Good Smeagol comes. Now let's go, go quickly, yes. Through the trees, while the Faces are dark. Yes, come let's go!'\n\n'Yes, we'll go soon,' said Frodo. 'But not at once. I will go with you as I promised. I promise again. But not now. You are not safe yet. I will save you, but you must trust me.'\n\n'We must trust Master?' said Gollum doubtfully. 'Why? Why not go at once? Where is the other one, the cross rude hobbit? Where is he?'\n\n'Away up there,' said Frodo, pointing to the waterfall. 'I am not going without him. We must go back to him.' His heart sank. This was too much like trickery. He did not really fear that Faramir would allow Gollum to be killed, but he would probably make him prisoner and bind him; and certainly what Frodo did would seem a treachery to the poor treacherous creature. It would probably be impossible ever to make him understand or believe that Frodo had saved his life in the only way he could. What else could he do? \u0426 to keep faith, as near as might be, with both sides. 'Come!' he said. 'Or the Precious will be angry. We are going back now, up the stream. Go on, go on, you go in front!'\n\nGollum crawled along close to the brink for a little way, snuffling and suspicious. Presently he stopped and raised his head. 'Something's there!' he said. 'Not a hobbit.' Suddenly he turned back. A green light was flickering in his bulging eyes. 'Masster, masster!' he hissed. 'Wicked! Tricksy! False!' He spat and stretched out his long arms with white snapping fingers.\n\nAt that moment the great black shape of Anborn loomed up behind him and came down on him. A large strong hand took him in the nape of the neck and pinned him. He twisted round like lightning, all wet and slimy as he was, wriggling like an eel, biting and scratching like a cat. But two more men came up out of the shadows.\n\n'Hold still!' said one. 'Or we'll stick you as full of pins as a hedgehog. Hold still!'\n\nGollum went limp, and began to whine and weep. They tied him, none too gently.\n\n'Easy, easy!' said Frodo. 'He has no strength to match you. Don't hurt him, if you can help it. He'll be quieter, if you don't. Smeagol! They won't hurt you. I'll go with you, and you shall come to no harm. Not unless they kill me too. Trust Master!'\n\nGollum turned and spat at him. The men picked him up, put a hood over his eyes, and carried him off.\n\nFrodo followed them, feeling very wretched. They went through the opening behind the bushes, and back, down the stairs and passages, into the cave. Two or three torches had been lit. Men were stirring. Sam was there, and he gave a queer look at the limp bundle that the men carried. 'Got him?' he said to Frodo.\n\n'Yes. Well no, I didn't get him. He came to me, because he trusted me at first, I'm afraid. I did not want him tied up like this. I hope it will be all right; but I hate the whole business.'\n\n'So do I,' said Sam. 'And nothing will ever be all right where that piece of misery is.'\n\nA man came and beckoned to the hobbits, and took them to the recess at the back of the cave. Faramir was sitting there in his chair, and the lamp had been rekindled in its niche above his head. He signed to them to sit down on the stools beside him. 'Bring wine for the guests,' he said. 'And bring the prisoner to me.'\n\nThe wine was brought, and then Anborn came carrying Gollum. He removed the cover from Gollum's head and set him on his feet standing behind him to support him. Gollum blinked, hooding the malice of his eyes with their heavy pale lids. A very miserable creature he looked, dripping and dank, smelling of fish (he still clutched one in his hand); his sparse locks were hanging like rank weed over his bony brows, his nose was snivelling.\n\n'Loose us! Loose us!' he said. 'The cord hurts us, yes it does, it hurts us, and we've done nothing.'\n\n'Nothing?' said Faramir, looking at the wretched creature with a keen glance, but without any expression in his face either of anger, or pity, or wonder. 'Nothing? Have you never done anything worthy of binding or of worse punishment? However, that is not for me to judge, happily. But tonight you have come where it is death to come. The fish of this pool are dearly bought.'\n\nGollum dropped the fish from his hand. 'Don't want fish,' he said.\n\n'The price is not set on the fish,' said Faramir. 'Only to come here and look on the pool bears the penalty of death. I have spared you so far at the prayer of Frodo here, who says that of him at least you have deserved some thanks. But you must also satisfy me. What is your name? Whence do you come? And whither do you go? What is your business?'\n\n'We are lost, lost,' said Gollum. 'No name, no business, no Precious, nothing. Only empty. Only hungry; yes, we are hungry. A few little fishes, nasty bony little fishes, for a poor creature, and they say death. So wise they are; so just, so very just.'\n\n'Not very wise,' said Faramir. 'But just: yes perhaps, as just as our little wisdom allows. Unloose him Frodo!' Faramir took a small nail-knife from his belt and handed it to Frodo. Gollum misunderstanding the gesture, squealed and fell down.\n\n'Now, Smeagol!' said Frodo. 'You must trust me. I will not desert you. Answer truthfully, if you can. It will do you good not harm.' He cut the cords on Gollum's wrists and ankles and raised him to his feet.\n\n'Come hither!' said Faramir. 'Look at me! Do you know the name of this place? Have you been here before?'\n\nSlowly Gollum raised his eyes and looked unwillingly into Faramir's. All light went out of them, and they stared bleak and pale for a moment into the clear unwavering eyes of the man of Gondor. There was a still silence. Then Gollum dropped his head and shrank down, until he was squatting on the floor, shivering. 'We doesn't know and we doesn't want to know,' he whimpered. 'Never came here; never come again.'\n\n'There are locked doors and closed windows in your mind, and dark rooms behind them,' said Faramir. 'But in this I judge that you speak the truth. It is well for you. What oath will you swear never to return; and never to lead any living creature hither by word or sign?'\n\n'Master knows,' said Gollum with a sidelong glance at Frodo. 'Yes, he knows. We will promise Master, if he saves us. We'll promise to It, yes.' He crawled to Frodo's feet. 'Save us, nice Master!' he whined. 'Smeagol promises to Precious, promises faithfully. Never come again, never speak, no never! No, precious, no!'\n\n'Are you satisfied?' said Faramir.\n\n'Yes,' said Frodo. 'At least, you must either accept this promise or carry out your law. You will get no more. But I promised that if he came to me, he should not be harmed. And I would not be proved faithless.'\n\nFaramir sat for a moment in thought. 'Very good,' he said at last. 'I surrender you to your master, to Frodo son of Drogo. Let him declare what he will do with you!'\n\n'But, Lord Faramir,' said Frodo bowing, 'you have not yet declared your will concerning the said Frodo, and until that is made known, he cannot shape his plans for himself or his companions. Your judgement was postponed until the morning; but that is now at hand.'\n\n'Then I will declare my doom,' said Faramir. 'As for you, Frodo, in so far as lies in me under higher authority, I declare you free in the realm of, Gondor to the furthest of its ancient bounds; save only that neither you nor any that go with you have leave to come to this place unbidden. This doom shall stand for a year and a day, and then cease, unless you shall before that term come to Minas Tirith and present yourself to the Lord and Steward of the City. Then I will entreat him to confirm what I have done and to make it lifelong. In the meantime, whomsoever you take under your protection shall be under my protection and under the shield of Gondor. Are you answered?'\n\nFrodo bowed low. 'I am answered,' he said, 'and I place myself at your service, if that is of any worth to one so high and honourable.'\n\n'It is of great worth,' said Faramir. 'And now, do you take this creature, this Smeagol, under your protection?'\n\n'I do take Smeagol under my protection,' said Frodo. Sam sighed audibly; and not at the courtesies, of which, as any hobbit would, he thoroughly approved. Indeed in the Shire such a matter would have required a great many more words and bows.\n\n'Then I say to you,' said Faramir, turning to Gollum, 'you are under doom of death; but while you walk with Frodo you are safe for our part. Yet if ever you be found by any man of Gondor astray without him, the doom shall fall. And may death find you swiftly, within Gondor or without, if you do not well serve him. Now answer me: whither would you go? You were his guide, he says. Whither were you leading him?' Gollum made no reply.\n\n'This I will not have secret,' said Faramir. 'Answer me, or I will reverse my judgement!' Still Gollum did not answer.\n\n'I will answer for him,' said Frodo. 'He brought me to the Black Gate, as I asked; but it was impassable.'\n\n'There is no open gate into the Nameless Land,' said Faramir.\n\n'Seeing this, we turned aside and came by the Southward road,' Frodo continued, 'for he said that there is, or there may be, a path near to Minas Ithil.'\n\n'Minas Morgul,' said Faramir.\n\n'I do not know clearly,' said Frodo, 'but the path climbs, I think, up into the mountains on the northern side of that vale where the old city stands. It goes up to a high cleft and so down to \u0426 that which is beyond.'\n\n'Do you know the name of that high pass?' said Faramir.\n\n'No,' said Frodo.\n\n'It is called Cirith Ungol.' Gollum hissed sharply and began muttering to himself. 'Is not that its name?' said Faramir turning to him.\n\n'No!' said Gollum, and then he squealed, as if something had stabbed him. 'Yes, yes, we heard the name once. But what does the name matter to us? Master says he must get in. So we must try some way. There is no other way to try, no.'\n\n'No other way?' said Faramir. 'How do you know that? And who has explored all the confines of that dark realm?' He looked long and thoughtfully at Gollum. Presently he spoke again. 'Take this creature away, Anborn. Treat him gently, but watch him. And do not you, Smeagol, try to dive into the falls. The rocks have such teeth there as would slay you before your time. Leave us now and take your fish!'\n\nAnborn went out and Gollum went cringing before him. The curtain was drawn across the recess.\n\n'Frodo, I think you do very unwisely in this,' said Faramir. 'I do not think you should go with this creature. It is wicked.'\n\n'No, not altogether wicked,' said Frodo.\n\n'Not wholly, perhaps,' said Faramir; 'but malice eats it like a canker, and the evil is growing. He will lead you to no good. If you will part with him, I will give him safe-conduct and guidance to any point on the borders of Gondor that he may name.'\n\n'He would not take it,' said Frodo. 'He would follow after me as he long has done. And I have promised many times to take him under my protection and to go where he led. You would not ask me to break faith with him?'\n\n'No,' said Faramir. 'But my heart would. For it seems less evil to counsel another man to break troth than to do so oneself, especially if one sees a friend bound unwitting to his own harm. But no \u0426 if he will go with you, you must now endure him. But I do not think you are holden to go to Cirith Ungol, of which he has told you less than he knows. That much I perceived clearly in his mind. Do not go to Cirith Ungol!'\n\n'Where then shall I go?' said Frodo. 'Back to the Black Gate and deliver myself up to the guard? What do you know against this place that makes its name so dreadful?'\n\n'Nothing certain,' said Faramir. 'We of Gondor do not ever pass east of the Road in these days, and none of us younger men has ever done so, nor has any of us set foot upon the Mountains of Shadow. Of them we know only old report and the rumour of bygone days. But there is some dark terror that dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul. If Cirith Ungol is named, old men and masters of lore will blanch and fall silent.\n\n'The valley of Minas Morgul passed into evil very long ago, and it was a menace and a dread while the banished Enemy dwelt yet far away, and Ithilien was still for the most part in our keeping. As you know, that city was once a strong place, proud and fair, Minas Ithil, the twin sister of our own city. But it was taken by fell men whom the Enemy in his first strength had dominated, and who wandered homeless and masterless after his fall. It is said that their lords were men of Numenor who had fallen into dark wickedness; to them the Enemy had given rings of power, and he had devoured them: living ghosts they were become, terrible and evil. After his going they took Minas Ithil and dwelt there, and they filled it, and all the valley about, with decay: it seemed empty and was not so, for a shapeless fear lived within the ruined walls. Nine Lords there were, and after the return of their Master, which they aided and prepared in secret, they grew strong again. Then the Nine Riders issued forth from the gates of horror, and we could not withstand them. Do not approach their citadel. You will be espied. It is a place of sleepless malice, full of lidless eyes. Do not go that way!'\n\n'But where else will you direct me?' said Frodo. 'You cannot yourself, you say, guide me to the mountains, nor over them. But over the mountains I am bound, by solemn undertaking to the Council, to find a way or perish in the seeking. And if I turn back, refusing the road in its bitter end, where then shall I go among Elves or Men? Would you have me come to Gondor with this Thing, the Thing that drove your brother mad with desire? What spell would it work in Minas Tirith? Shall there be two cities of Minas Morgul, grinning at each other across a dead land filled with rottenness?'\n\n'I would not have it so,' said Faramir.\n\n'Then what would you have me do?'\n\n'I know not. Only I would not have you go to death or to torment. And I do not think that Mithrandir would have chosen this way.'\n\n'Yet since he is gone, I must take such paths as I can find. And there is no time for long searching,' said Frodo.\n\n'It is a hard doom and a hopeless errand,' said Faramir. 'But at the least, remember my warning: beware of this guide, Smeagol. He has done murder before now. I read it in him.' He sighed.\n\n'Well, so we meet and part, Frodo son of Drogo. You have no need of soft words: I do not hope to see you again on any other day under this Sun. But you shall go now with my blessing upon you, and upon all your people. Rest a little while food is prepared for you.\n\n'I would gladly learn how this creeping Smeagol became possessed of the Thing of which we speak, and how he lost it, but I will not trouble you now. If ever beyond hope you return to the lands of the living and we retell our tales, sitting by a wall in the sun, laughing at old grief, you shall tell me then. Until that time, or some other time beyond the vision of the Seeing-stones of Numenor, farewell!'\n\nHe rose and bowed low to Frodo, and drawing the curtain passed out into the cave.\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nJourney to the Cross-roads\n\nFrodo and Sam returned to their beds and lay there in silence resting for a little, while men bestirred themselves and the business of the day began. After a while water was brought to them, and then they were led to a table where food was set for three. Faramir broke his fast with them. He had not slept since the battle on the day before, yet he did not look weary.\n\nWhen they had finished they stood up. 'May no hunger trouble you on the road,' said Faramir. 'You have little provision, but some small store of food fit for travellers I have ordered to be stowed in your packs. You will have no lack of water as you walk in Ithilien, but do not drink of any stream that flows from Imlad Morgul, the Valley of Living Death. This also I must tell you. My scouts and watchers have all returned, even some that have crept within sight of the Morannon. They all find a strange thing. The land is empty. Nothing is on the road, and no sound of foot, or horn, or bowstring is anywhere to be heard. A waiting silence broods above the Nameless Land. I do not know what this portends. But the time draws swiftly to some great conclusion. Storm is coming. Hasten while you may! If you are ready, let us go. The Sun will soon rise above the shadow.'\n\nThe hobbits' packs were brought to them (a little heavier than they had been), and also two stout staves of polished wood, shod with iron, and with carven heads through which ran plaited leathern thongs.\n\n'I have no fitting gifts to give you at our parting,' said Faramir; 'but take these staves. They may be of service to those who walk or climb in the wild. The men of the White Mountains use them; though these have been cut down to your height and newly shod. They are made of the fair tree lebethron, beloved of the woodwrights of Gondor, and a virtue has been set upon them of finding and returning. May that virtue not wholly fail under the Shadow into which you go!'\n\nThe hobbits bowed low. 'Most gracious host,' said Frodo, 'it was said to me by Elrond Halfelven that I should find friendship upon the way, secret and unlooked for. Certainly I looked for no such friendship as you have shown. To have found it turns evil to great good.'\n\nNow they made ready to depart. Gollum was brought out of some corner or hiding-hole, and he seemed better pleased with himself than he had been, though he kept close to Frodo and avoided the glance of Faramir.\n\n'Your guide must be blindfolded,' said Faramir, 'but you and your servant Samwise I release from this, if you wish.'\n\nGollum squealed, and squirmed, and clutched at Frodo, when they came to bind his eyes; and Frodo said: 'Blindfold us all three, and cover up my eyes first, and then perhaps he will see that no harm is meant.' This was done, and they were led from the cave of Henneth Annun. After they had passed the passages and stairs they felt the cool morning air, fresh and sweet, about them. Still blind they went on for some little time, up and then gently down. At last the voice of Faramir ordered them to be uncovered.\n\nThey stood under the boughs of the woods again. No noise of the falls could be heard, for a long southward slope lay now between them and the ravine in which the stream flowed. To the west they could see light through the trees, as if the world came there to a sudden end, at a brink looking out only on to sky.\n\n'Here is the last parting of our ways,' said Faramir. 'If you take my counsel, you will not turn eastward yet. Go straight on, for thus you will have the cover of the woodland for many miles. On your west is an edge where the land falls into the great vales, sometimes suddenly and sheer, sometimes in long hillsides. Keep near to this edge and the skirts of the forest. In the beginning of your journey you may walk under daylight, I think. The land dreams in a false peace, and for a while all evil is withdrawn. Fare you well, while you may!'\n\nHe embraced the hobbits then, after the manner of his people, stooping, and placing his hands upon their shoulders, and kissing their foreheads. 'Go with the good will of all good men!' he said.\n\nThey bowed to the ground. Then he turned and without looking back he left them and went to his two guards that stood at a little distance away. They marvelled to see with what speed these green-clad men now moved, vanishing almost in the twinkling of an eye. The forest where Faramir had stood seemed empty and drear, as if a dream had passed.\n\nFrodo sighed and turned back southward. As if to mark his disregard of all such courtesy, Gollum was scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree. 'Hungry again already?' thought Sam. 'Well, now for it again!'\n\n'Have they gone at last?' said Gollum. 'Nassty wicked Men! Smeagol's neck still hurts him, yes it does. Let's go!'\n\n'Yes, let us go,' said Frodo. 'But if you can only speak ill of those who showed you mercy, keep silent!'\n\n'Nice Master!' said Gollum. 'Smeagol was only joking. Always forgives, he does, yes, yes, even nice Master's little trickses. Oh yes, nice Master, nice Smeagol!'\n\nFrodo and Sam did not answer. Hoisting their packs and taking their staves in hand, they passed on into the woods of Ithilien.\n\nTwice that day they rested and took a little of the food provided by Faramir: dried fruits and salted meat, enough for many days; and bread enough to last while it was still fresh. Gollum ate nothing.\n\nThe sun rose and passed overhead unseen, and began to sink, and the light through the trees to the west grew golden; and always they walked in cool green shadow, and all about them was silence. The birds seemed all to have flown away or to have fallen dumb.\n\nDarkness came early to the silent woods, and before the fall of night they halted, weary, for they had walked seven leagues or more from Henneth Annun. Frodo lay and slept away the night on the deep mould beneath an ancient tree. Sam beside him was more uneasy: he woke many times, but there was never a sign of Gollum, who had slipped off as soon as the others had settled to rest. Whether he had slept by himself in some hole nearby, or had wandered restlessly prowling through the night, he did not say; but he returned with the first glimmer of light, and roused his companions.\n\n'Must get up, yes they must!' he said. 'Long ways to go still, south and east. Hobbits must make haste!'\n\nThat day passed much as the day before had gone, except that the silence seemed deeper; the air grew heavy, and it began to be stifling under the trees. It felt as if thunder was brewing. Gollum often paused, sniffing the air, and then he would mutter to himself and urge them to greater speed.\n\nAs the third stage of their day's march drew on and afternoon waned, the forest opened out, and the trees became larger and more scattered. Great ilexes of huge girth stood dark and solemn in wide glades with here and there among them hoary ash-trees, and giant oaks just putting out their brown-green buds. About them lay long launds of green grass dappled with celandine and anemones, white and blue, now folded for sleep; and there were acres populous with the leaves of woodland hyacinths: already their sleek bell-stems were thrusting through the mould. No living creature, beast or bird, was to be seen, but in these open places Gollum grew afraid, and they walked now with caution, flitting from one long shadow to another.\n\nLight was fading fast when they came to the forest-end. There they sat under an old gnarled oak that sent its roots twisting like snakes down a steep crumbling bank. A deep dim valley lay before them. On its further side the woods gathered again, blue and grey under the sullen evening, and marched on southwards. To the right the Mountains of Gondor glowed, remote in the West, under a fire-flecked sky. To the left lay darkness: the towering walls of Mordor; and out of that darkness the long valley came, falling steeply in an ever-widening trough towards the Anduin. At its bottom ran a hurrying stream: Frodo could hear its stony voice coming up through the silence; and beside it on the hither side a road went winding down like a pale ribbon, down into chill grey mists that no gleam of sunset touched. There it seemed to Frodo that he descried far off, floating as it were on a shadowy sea, the high dim tops and broken pinnacles of old towers forlorn and dark.\n\nHe turned to Gollum. 'Do you know where we are?' he said.\n\n'Yes, Master. Dangerous places. This is the road from the Tower of the Moon, Master, down to the ruined city by the shores of the River. The ruined city, yes, very nasty place, full of enemies. We shouldn't have taken Men's advice. Hobbits have come a long way out of the path. Must go east now, away up there.' He waved his skinny arm towards the darkling mountains. 'And we can't use this road. Oh no! Cruel peoples come this way, down from the Tower.'\n\nFrodo looked down on to the road. At any rate nothing was moving on it now. It appeared lonely and forsaken, running down to empty ruins in the mist. But there was an evil feeling in the air, as if things might indeed be passing up and down that eyes could not see. Frodo shuddered as he looked again at the distant pinnacles now dwindling into night, and the sound of the water seemed cold and cruel: the voice of Morgulduin, the polluted stream that flowed from the Valley of the Wraiths.\n\n'What shall we do?' he said. 'We have walked long and far. Shall we look for some place in the woods behind where we can lie hidden?'\n\n'No good hiding in the dark,' said Gollum. 'It's in day that hobbits must hide now, yes, in day.'\n\n'Oh come!' said Sam. 'We must rest for a bit, even if we get up again in the middle of the night. There'll still be hours of dark then time enough for you to take us a long march, if you know the way.'\n\nGollum reluctantly agreed to this, and he turned back towards the trees, working eastward for a while along the straggling edges of the wood. He would not rest on the ground so near the evil road, and after some debate they all climbed up into the crotch of a large holm-oak, whose thick branches springing together from the trunk made a good hiding-place and a fairly comfortable refuge. Night fell and it grew altogether dark under the canopy of the tree. Frodo and Sam drank a little water and ate some bread and dried fruit, but Gollum at once curled up and went to sleep. The hobbits did not shut their eyes.\n\nIt must have been a little after midnight when Gollum woke up: suddenly they were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming at them. He listened and sniffed, which seemed, as they had noticed before, his usual method of discovering the time of night.\n\n'Are we rested? Have we had beautiful sleep?' he said. 'Let's go!'\n\n'We aren't, and we haven't,' growled Sam. 'But we'll go if we must.'\n\nGollum dropped at once from the branches of the tree on to all fours, and the hobbits followed more slowly.\n\nAs soon as they were down they went on again with Gollum leading, eastwards, up the dark sloping land. They could see little, for the night was now so deep that they were hardly aware of the stems of trees before they stumbled against them. The ground became more broken and walking was more difficult, but Gollum seemed in no way troubled. He led them through thickets and wastes of brambles; sometimes round the lip of a deep cleft or dark pit, sometimes down into black bush-shrouded hollows and out again; but if ever they went a little downward, always the further slope was longer and steeper. They were climbing steadily. At their first halt they looked back, and they could dimly perceive the roofs of the forest they had left behind lying like a vast dense shadow, a darker night under the dark blank sky. There seemed to be a great blackness looming slowly out of the East, eating up the faint blurred stars. Later the sinking moon escaped from the pursuing cloud, but it was ringed all about with a sickly yellow glare.\n\nAt last Gollum turned to the hobbits. 'Day soon,' he said. 'Hobbits must hurry. Not safe to stay in the open in these places. Make haste!'\n\nHe quickened his pace, and they followed him wearily. Soon they began to climb up on to a great hog-back of land. For the most part it was covered with a thick growth of gorse and whortleberry, and low tough thorns, though here and there clearings opened, the scars of recent fires. The gorse-bushes became more frequent as they got nearer the top; very old and tall they were, gaunt and leggy below but thick above, and already putting out yellow flowers that glimmered in the gloom and gave a faint sweet scent. So tall were the spiny thickets that the hobbits could walk upright under them, passing through long dry aisles carpeted with a deep prickly mould.\n\nOn the further edge of this broad hill-back they stayed their march and crawled for hiding underneath a tangled knot of thorns. Their twisted boughs, stooping to the ground, were overridden by a clambering maze of old briars. Deep inside there was a hollow hall, raftered with dead branch and bramble, and roofed with the first leaves and shoots of spring. There they lay for a while, too tired yet to eat; and peering out through the holes in the covert they watched for the slow growth of day.\n\nBut no day came, only a dead brown twilight. In the East there was a dull red glare under the lowering cloud: it was not the red of dawn. Across the tumbled lands between, the mountains of the Ephel Duath frowned at them, black and shapeless below where night lay thick and did not pass away, above with jagged tops and edges outlined hard and menacing against the fiery glow. Away to their right a great shoulder of the mountains stood out, dark and black amid the shadows, thrusting westward.\n\n'Which way do we go from here?' asked Frodo. 'Is that the opening of \u0426 of the Morgul Valley, away over there beyond that black mass?'\n\n'Need we think about it yet?' said Sam, 'Surely we're not going to move any more today, if day it is?'\n\n'Perhaps not, perhaps not,' said Gollum. 'But we must go soon, to the Cross-roads. Yes, to the Cross-roads. That's the way over there yes, Master.'\n\nThe red glare over Mordor died away. The twilight deepened as great vapours rose in the East and crawled above them. Frodo and Sam took a little food and then lay down, but Gollum was restless. He would not eat any of their food, but he drank a little water and then crawled about under the bushes, sniffing and muttering. Then suddenly he disappeared.\n\n'Off hunting, I suppose,' said Sam and yawned. It was his turn to sleep first, and he was soon deep in a dream. He thought he was back in the Bag End garden looking for something; but he had a heavy pack on his back, which made him stoop. It all seemed very weedy and rank somehow, and thorns and bracken were invading the beds down near the bottom hedge.\n\n'A job of work for me, I can see; but I'm so tired,' he kept on saying. Presently he remembered what he was looking for. 'My pipe!' he said, and with that he woke up.\n\n'Silly!' he said to himself, as he opened his eyes and wondered why he was lying down under the hedge. 'It's in your pack all the time!' Then he realized, first that the pipe might be in his pack but he had no leaf, and next that he was hundreds of miles from Bag End. He sat up. It seemed to be almost dark. Why had his master let him sleep on out of turn, right on till evening?\n\n'Haven't you had no sleep, Mr. Frodo?' he said. 'What's the time? Seems to be getting late!'\n\n'No it isn't,' said Frodo. 'But the day is getting darker instead of lighter: darker and darker. As far as I can tell, it isn't midday yet, and you've only slept for about three hours.'\n\n'I wonder what's up,' said Sam. 'Is there a storm coming? If so it's going to be the worst there ever was. We shall wish we were down a deep hole, not just stuck under a hedge.' He listened. 'What's that? Thunder, or drums, or what is it?'\n\n'I don't know,' said Frodo. 'It's been going on for a good while now. Sometimes the ground seems to tremble, sometimes it seems to be the heavy air throbbing in your ears.'\n\nSam looked round. 'Where's Gollum?' he said. 'Hasn't he come back yet?'\n\n'No,' said Frodo. 'There's not been a sign or sound of him.'\n\n'Well, I can't abide him,' said Sam. 'In fact, I've never taken anything on a journey that I'd have been less sorry to lose on the way. But it would be just like him, after coming all these miles, to go and get lost now, just when we shall need him most \u0426 that is, if he's ever going to be any use, which I doubt.'\n\n'You forget the Marshes,' said Frodo. 'I hope nothing has happened to him.'\n\n'And I hope he's up to no tricks. And anyway I hope he doesn't fall into other hands, as you might say. Because if he does, we shall soon be in for trouble.'\n\nAt that moment a rolling and rumbling noise was heard again, louder now and deeper. The ground seemed to quiver under their feet. 'I think we are in for trouble anyhow,' said Frodo. 'I'm afraid our journey is drawing to an end.'\n\n'Maybe,' said Sam; 'but where there's life there's hope, as my Gaffer used to say; and need of vittles, as he mostways used to add. You have a bite, Mr. Frodo, and then a bit of sleep.'\n\nThe afternoon, as Sam supposed it must be called, wore on. Looking out from the covert he could see only a dun, shadowless world, fading slowly into a featureless, colourless gloom. It felt stifling but not warm. Frodo slept unquietly, turning and tossing, and sometimes murmuring. Twice Sam thought he heard him speaking Gandalf's name. The time seemed to drag interminably. Suddenly Sam heard a hiss behind him, and there was Gollum on all fours, peering at them with gleaming eyes.\n\n'Wake up, wake up! Wake up, sleepies!' he whispered. 'Wake up! No time to lose. We must go, yes, we must go at once. No time to lose!'\n\nSam stared at him suspiciously: he seemed frightened or excited. 'Go now? What's your little game? It isn't time yet. It can't be tea-time even, leastways not in decent places where there is tea-time.'\n\n'Silly!' hissed Gollum. 'We're not in decent places. Time's running short, yes, running fast. No time to lose. We must go. Wake up. Master, wake up.' He clawed at Frodo; and Frodo, startled out of sleep, sat up suddenly and seized him by the arm. Gollum tore himself loose and backed away.\n\n'They mustn't be silly,' he hissed. 'We must go. No time to lose!' And nothing more could they get out of him. Where he had been, and what he thought was brewing to make him in such a hurry, he would not say. Sam was filled with deep suspicion, and showed it; but Frodo gave no sign of what was passing in his mind. He sighed, hoisted his pack, and prepared to go out into the ever-gathering darkness.\n\nVery stealthily Gollum led them down the hillside, keeping under cover wherever it was possible, and running, almost bent to the ground, across any open space; but the light was now so dim that even a keen-eyed beast of the wild could scarcely have seen the hobbits, hooded, in their grey cloaks, nor heard them, walking as warily as the little people can. Without the crack of a twig or the rustle of a leaf they passed and vanished.\n\nFor about an hour they went on, silently, in single file, oppressed by the gloom and by the absolute stillness of the land, broken only now and again by the faint rumbling as of thunder far away or drum-beats in some hollow of the hills. Down from their hiding-place they went, and then turning south they steered as straight a course as Gollum could find across a long broken slope that leaned up towards the mountains. Presently, not far ahead, looming up like a black wall, they saw a belt of trees. As they drew nearer they became aware that these were of vast size, very ancient it seemed, and still towering high, though their tops were gaunt and broken, as if tempest and lightning-blast had swept across them, but had failed to kill them or to shake their fathomless roots.\n\n'The Cross-roads, yes,' whispered Gollum, the first words that had been spoken since they left their hiding-place. 'We must go that way.' Turning eastward now, he led them up the slope; and then suddenly there it was before them: the Southward Road, winding its way about the outer feet of the mountains, until presently it plunged into the great ring of trees.\n\n'This is the only way,' whispered Gollum. 'No paths beyond the road. No paths. We must go to the Cross-roads. But make haste! Be silent!'\n\nAs furtively as scouts within the campment of their enemies, they crept down on to the road, and stole along its westward edge under the stony bank, grey as the stones themselves, and soft-footed as hunting cats. At length they reached the trees, and found that they stood in a great roofless ring, open in the middle to the sombre sky; and the spaces between their immense boles were like the great dark arches of some ruined hall. In the very centre four ways met. Behind them lay the road to the Morannon; before them it ran out again upon its long journey south; to their right the road from old Osgiliath came climbing up, and crossing, passed out eastward into darkness: the fourth way, the road they were to take.\n\nStanding there for a moment filled with dread Frodo became aware that a light was shining; he saw it glowing on Sam's face beside him. Turning towards it, he saw, beyond an arch of boughs, the road to Osgiliath running almost as straight as a stretched ribbon down, down, into the West. There, far away, beyond sad Gondor now overwhelmed in shade, the Sun was sinking, finding at last the hem of the great slow-rolling pall of cloud, and falling in an ominous fire towards the yet unsullied Sea. The brief glow fell upon a huge sitting figure, still and solemn as the great stone kings of Argonath. The years had gnawed it, and violent hands had maimed it. Its head was gone, and in its place was set in mockery a round rough-hewn stone, rudely painted by savage hands in the likeness of a grinning face with one large red eye in the midst of its forehead. Upon its knees and mighty chair, and all about the pedestal, were idle scrawls mixed with the foul symbols that the maggot-folk of Mordor used.\n\nSuddenly, caught by the level beams, Frodo saw the old king's head: it was lying rolled away by the roadside. 'Look, Sam!' he cried, startled into speech. 'Look! The king has got a crown again!'\n\nThe eyes were hollow and the carven beard was broken, but about the high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold. A trailing plant with flowers like small white stars had bound itself across the brows as if in reverence for the fallen king, and in the crevices of his stony hair yellow stonecrop gleamed.\n\n'They cannot conquer for ever!' said Frodo. And then suddenly the brief glimpse was gone. The Sun dipped and vanished, and as if at the shuttering of a lamp, black night fell.\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nThe Stairs of Cirith Ungol\n\nGollum was tugging at Frodo's cloak and hissing with fear and impatience. 'We must go,' he said. 'We mustn't stand here. Make haste!'\n\nReluctantly Frodo turned his back on the West and followed as his guide led him, out into the darkness of the East. They left the ring of trees and crept along the road towards the mountains. This road, too, ran straight for a while, but soon it began to bend away southwards, until it came right under the great shoulder of rock that they had seen from the distance. Black and forbidding it loomed above them, darker than the dark sky behind. Crawling under its shadow the road went on, and rounding it sprang east again and began to climb steeply.\n\nFrodo and Sam were plodding along with heavy hearts, no longer able to care greatly about their peril. Frodo's head was bowed; his burden was dragging him down again. As soon as the great Cross-roads had been passed, the weight of it, almost forgotten in Ithilien, had begun to grow once more. Now, feeling the way become steep before his feet, he looked wearily up; and then he saw it, even as Gollum had said that he would: the city of the Ringwraiths. He cowered against the stony bank.\n\nA long-tilted valley, a deep gulf of shadow, ran back far into the mountains. Upon the further side, some way within the valley's arms high on a rocky seat upon the black knees of the Ephel Duath, stood the walls and tower of Minas Morgul. All was dark about it, earth and sky, but it was lit with light. Not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of Minas Ithil long ago, Tower of the Moon, fair and radiant in the hollow of the hills. Paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow eclipse was the light of it now, wavering and blowing like a noisome exhalation of decay, a corpse-light, a light that illuminated nothing. In the walls and tower windows showed, like countless black holes looking inward into emptiness; but the topmost course of the tower revolved slowly, first one way and then another, a huge ghostly head leering into the night. For a moment the three companions stood there, shrinking, staring up with unwilling eyes. Gollum was the first to recover. Again he pulled at their cloaks urgently, but he spoke no word. Almost he dragged them forward. Every step was reluctant, and time seemed to slow its pace, so that between the raising of a foot and the setting of it down minutes of loathing passed.\n\nSo they came slowly to the white bridge. Here the road, gleaming faintly, passed over the stream in the midst of the valley, and went on, winding deviously up towards the city's gate: a black mouth opening in the outer circle of the northward walls. Wide flats lay on either bank, shadowy meads filled with pale white flowers. Luminous these were too, beautiful and yet horrible of shape, like the demented forms in an uneasy dream; and they gave forth a faint sickening charnel-smell; an odour of rottenness filled the air. From mead to mead the bridge sprang. Figures stood there at its head, carven with cunning in forms human and bestial, but all corrupt and loathsome. The water flowing beneath was silent, and it steamed, but the vapour that rose from it, curling and twisting about the bridge, was deadly cold. Frodo felt his senses reeling and his mind darkening. Then suddenly, as if some force were at work other than his own will, he began to hurry, tottering forward, his groping hands held out, his head lolling from side to side. Both Sam and Gollum ran after him. Sam caught his master in his arms, as he stumbled and almost fell, right on the threshold of the bridge.\n\n'Not that way! No, not that way!' whispered Gollum, but the breath between his teeth seemed to tear the heavy stillness like a whistle, and he cowered to the ground in terror.\n\n'Hold up, Mr. Frodo!' muttered Sam in Frodo's ear. 'Come back! Not that way. Gollum says not, and for once I agree with him.'\n\nFrodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched his eyes away from the city on the hill. The luminous tower fascinated him, and he fought the desire that was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its gate. At last with an effort he turned back, and as he did so, he felt the Ring resisting him, dragging at the chain about his neck; and his eyes too, as he looked away, seemed for the moment to have been blinded. The darkness before him was impenetrable.\n\nGollum, crawling on the ground like a frightened animal, was already vanishing into the gloom. Sam, supporting and guiding his stumbling master, followed after him as quickly as he could. Not far from the near bank of the stream there was a gap in the stone-wall beside the road. Through this they passed, and Sam saw that they were on a narrow path that gleamed faintly at first, as the main road did, until climbing above the meads of deadly flowers it faded and went dark, winding its crooked way up into the northern sides of the valley.\n\nAlong this path the hobbits trudged, side by side, unable to see Gollum in front of them, except when he turned back to beckon them on. Then his eyes shone with a green-white light, reflecting the noisome Morgul-sheen perhaps, or kindled by some answering mood within. Of that deadly gleam and of the dark eyeholes Frodo and Sam were always conscious, ever glancing fearfully over their shoulders, and ever dragging their eyes back to find the darkening path. Slowly they laboured on. As they rose above the stench and vapours of the poisonous stream their breath became easier and their heads clearer; but now their limbs were deadly tired, as if they had walked all night under a burden, or had been swimming long against a heavy tide of water. At last they could go no further without a halt.\n\nFrodo stopped and sat down on a stone. They had now climbed up to the top of a great hump of bare rock. Ahead of them there was a bay in the valley-side, and round the head of this the path went on, no more than a wide ledge with a chasm on the right; across the sheer southward face of the mountain it crawled upwards, until it disappeared into the blackness above.\n\n'I must rest a while, Sam,' whispered Frodo. 'It's heavy on me, Sam lad, very heavy. I wonder how far I can carry it? Anyway I must rest before we venture on to that.' He pointed to the narrow way ahead.\n\n'Sssh! ssh!' hissed Gollum hurrying back to them. 'Sssh!' His fingers were on his lips and he shook his head urgently. Tugging at Frodo's sleeve, he pointed towards the path; but Frodo would not move.\n\n'Not yet,' he said, 'not yet.' Weariness and more than weariness oppressed him; it seemed as if a heavy spell was laid on his mind and body. 'I must rest,' he muttered.\n\nAt this Gollum's fear and agitation became so great that he spoke again, hissing behind his hand, as if to keep the sound from unseen listeners in the air. 'Not here, no. Not rest here. Fools! Eyes can see us. When they come to the bridge they will see us. Come away! Climb, climb! Come!'\n\n'Come, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. 'He's right, again. We can't stay here.'\n\n'All right,' said Frodo in a remote voice, as of one speaking half asleep. 'I will try.' Wearily he got to his feet.\n\nBut it was too late. At that moment the rock quivered and trembled beneath them. The great rumbling noise, louder than ever before, rolled in the ground and echoed in the mountains. Then with searing suddenness there came a great red flash. Far beyond the eastern mountains it leapt into the sky and splashed the lowering clouds with crimson. In that valley of shadow and cold deathly light it seemed unbearably violent and fierce. Peaks of stone and ridges like notched knives sprang out in staring black against the uprushing flame in Gorgoroth. Then came a great crack of thunder.\n\nAnd Minas Morgul answered. There was a flare of livid lightnings: forks of blue flame springing up from the tower and from the encircling hills into the sullen clouds. The earth groaned; and out of the city there came a cry. Mingled with harsh high voices as of birds of prey, and the shrill neighing of horses wild with rage and fear, there came a rending screech, shivering, rising swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing. The hobbits wheeled round towards it, and cast themselves down, holding their hands upon their ears.\n\nAs the terrible cry ended, falling back through a long sickening wail to silence, Frodo slowly raised his head. Across the narrow valley, now almost on a level with his eyes, the walls of the evil city stood, and its cavernous gate, shaped like an open mouth with gleaming teeth, was gaping wide. And out of the gate an army came.\n\nAll that host was clad in sable, dark as the night. Against the wan walls and the luminous pavement of the road Frodo could see them, small black figures in rank upon rank, marching swiftly and silently, passing outwards in an endless stream. Before them went a great cavalry of horsemen moving like ordered shadows, and at their head was one greater than all the rest: a Rider, all black, save that on his hooded head he had a helm like a crown that flickered with a perilous light. Now he was drawing near the bridge below, and Frodo's staring eyes followed him, unable to wink or to withdraw. Surely there was the Lord of the Nine Riders returned to earth to lead his ghastly host to battle? Here, yes here indeed was the haggard king whose cold hand had smitten down the Ring-bearer with his deadly knife. The old wound throbbed with pain and a great chill spread towards Frodo's heart.\n\nEven as these thoughts pierced him with dread and held him bound as with a spell, the Rider halted suddenly, right before the entrance of the bridge, and behind him all the host stood still. There was a pause, a dead silence. Maybe it was the Ring that called to the Wraith-lord, and for a moment he was troubled, sensing some other power within his valley. This way and that turned the dark head helmed and crowned with fear, sweeping the shadows with its unseen eyes. Frodo waited, like a bird at the approach of a snake, unable to move. And as he waited, he felt, more urgent than ever before, the command that he should put on the Ring. But great as the pressure was, he felt no inclination now to yield to it. He knew that the Ring would only betray him, and that he had not, even if he put it on, the power to face the Morgul-king \u0426 not yet. There was no longer any answer to that command in his own will, dismayed by terror though it was, and he felt only the beating upon him of a great power from outside. It took his hand, and as Frodo watched with his mind, not willing it but in suspense (as if he looked on some old story far away), it moved the hand inch by inch towards the chain upon his neck. Then his own will stirred; slowly it forced the hand back, and set it to find another thing, a thing lying hidden near his breast. Cold and hard it seemed as his grip closed on it: the phial of Galadriel, so long treasured, and almost forgotten till that hour. As he touched it, for a while all thought of the Ring was banished from his mind. He sighed and bent his head.\n\nAt that moment the Wraith-king turned and spurred his horse and rode across the bridge, and all his dark host followed him. Maybe the elven-hoods defied his unseen eyes, and the mind of his small enemy; being strengthened, had turned aside his thought. But he was in haste. Already the hour had struck, and at his great Master's bidding he must march with war into the West.\n\nSoon he had passed, like a shadow into shadow, down the winding road, and behind him still the black ranks crossed the bridge. So great an army had never issued from that vale since the days of Isildur's might; no host so fell and strong in arms had yet assailed the fords of Anduin; and yet it was but one and not the greatest of the hosts that Mordor now sent forth.\n\nFrodo stirred. And suddenly his heart went out to Faramir. 'The storm has burst at last,' he thought. 'This great array of spears and swords is going to Osgiliath. Will Faramir get across in time? He guessed it, but did he know the hour? And who can now hold the fords when the King of the Nine Riders comes? And other armies will come. I am too late. All is lost. I tarried on the way. All is lost. Even if my errand is performed, no one will ever know. There will be no one I can tell. It will be in vain.' Overcome with weakness he wept. And still the host of Morgul crossed the bridge.\n\nThen at a great distance, as if it came out of memories of the Shire, some sunlit early morning, when the day called and doors were opening, he heard Sam's voice speaking. 'Wake up, Mr. Frodo! Wake up!' Had the voice added: 'Your breakfast is ready,' he would hardly have been surprised. Certainly Sam was urgent. 'Wake up, Mr. Frodo! They're gone,' he said.\n\nThere was a dull clang. The gates of Minas Morgul had closed. The last rank of spears had vanished down the road. The tower still grinned across the valley, but the light was fading in it. The whole city was falling back into a dark brooding shade, and silence. Yet still it was filled with watchfulness.\n\n'Wake up, Mr. Frodo! They're gone, and we'd better go too. There's something still alive in that place, something with eyes, or a seeing mind, if you take me; and the longer we stay in one spot, the sooner it will get on to us. Come on, Mr. Frodo!'\n\nFrodo raised his head, and then stood up. Despair had not left him, but the weakness had passed. He even smiled grimly, feeling now as clearly as a moment before he had felt the opposite, that what he had to do, he had to do, if he could, and that whether Faramir or Aragorn or Elrond or Galadriel or Gandalf or anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purpose. He took his staff in one hand and the phial in his other. When he saw that the clear light was already welling through his fingers, he thrust it into his bosom and held it against his heart. Then turning from the city of Morgul, now no more than a grey glimmer across a dark gulf, he prepared to take the upward road.\n\nGollum, it seemed, had crawled off along the ledge into the darkness beyond, when the gates of Minas Morgul opened, leaving the hobbits where they lay. He now came creeping back, his teeth chattering and his fingers snapping. 'Foolish! Silly!' he hissed. 'Make haste! They mustn't think danger has passed. It hasn't. Make haste!'\n\nThey did not answer, but they followed him on to the climbing ledge. It was little to the liking of either of them, not even after facing so many other perils; but it did not last long. Soon the path reached a rounded angle where the mountain-side swelled out again, and there it suddenly entered a narrow opening in the rock. They had come to the first stair that Gollum had spoken of. The darkness was almost complete, and they could see nothing much beyond their hands' stretch; but Gollum's eyes shone pale, several feet above, as he turned back towards them.\n\n'Careful!' he whispered. 'Steps. Lots of steps. Must be careful!'\n\nCare was certainly needed. Frodo and Sam at first felt easier, having now a wall on either side, but the stairway was almost as steep as a ladder, and as they climbed up and up, they became more and more aware of the long black fall behind them. And the steps were narrow, spaced unevenly, and often treacherous: they were worn and smooth at the edges, and some were broken, and some cracked as foot was set upon them. The hobbits struggled on, until at last they were clinging with desperate fingers to the steps ahead, and forcing their aching knees to bend and straighten; and ever as the stair cut its way deeper into the sheer mountain the rocky walls rose higher and higher above their heads.\n\nAt length, just as they felt that they could endure no more, they saw Gollum's eyes peering down at them again. 'We're up,' he whispered. 'First stair's past. Clever hobbits to climb so high, very clever hobbits. Just a few more little steps and that's all, yes.'\n\nDizzy and very tired Sam, and Frodo following him, crawled up the last step, and sat down rubbing their legs and knees. They were in a deep dark passage that seemed still to go up before them, though at a gentler slope and without steps. Gollum did not let them rest long.\n\n'There's another stair still,' he said. 'Much longer stair. Rest when we get to the top of next stair. Not yet.'\n\nSam groaned. 'Longer, did you say?' he asked.\n\n'Yes, yess, longer,' said Gollum. 'But not so difficult. Hobbits have climbed the Straight Stair. Next comes the Winding Stair.'\n\n'And what after that?' said Sam.\n\n'We shall see,' said Gollum softly. 'O yes, we shall see!'\n\n'I thought you said there was a tunnel,' said Sam. 'Isn't there a tunnel or something to go through?'\n\n'O yes, there's a tunnel,' said Gollum. 'But hobbits can rest before they try that. If they get through that, they'll be nearly at the top. Very nearly, if they get through. O yes!'\n\nFrodo shivered. The climb had made him sweat, but now he felt cold and clammy, and there was a chill draught in the dark passage, blowing down from the invisible heights above. He got up and shook himself. 'Well, let's go on!' he said. 'This is no place to sit in.'\n\nThe passage seemed to go on for miles, and always the chill air flowed over them, rising as they went on to a bitter wind. The mountains seemed to be trying with their deadly breath to daunt them, to turn them back from the secrets of the high places, or to blow them away into the darkness behind. They only knew that they had come to the end, when suddenly they felt no wall at their right hand. They could see very little. Great black shapeless masses and deep grey shadows loomed above them and about them, but now and again a dull red light flickered up under the lowering clouds, and for a moment they were aware of tall peaks, in front and on either side, like pillars holding up a vast sagging roof. They seemed to have climbed up many hundreds of feet, on to a wide shelf. A cliff was on their left and a chasm on their right.\n\nGollum led the way close under the cliff. For the present they were no longer climbing, but the ground was now more broken and dangerous in the dark, and there were blocks and lumps of fallen stone in the way. Their going was slow and cautious. How many hours had passed since they had entered the Morgul Vale neither Sam nor Frodo could any longer guess. The night seemed endless.\n\nAt length they were once more aware of a wall looming up, and once more a stairway opened before them. Again they halted, and again they began to climb. It was a long and weary ascent; but this stairway did not delve into the mountain-side. Here the huge cliff face sloped backwards, and the path like a snake wound to and fro across it. At one point it crawled sideways right to the edge of the dark chasm, and Frodo glancing down saw below him as a vast deep pit the great ravine at the head of the Morgul Valley. Down in its depths glimmered like a glow-worm thread the wraith-road from the dead city to the Nameless Pass. He turned hastily away.\n\nStill on and up the stairway bent and crawled, until at last with a final flight, short and straight, it climbed out again on to another level. The path had veered away from the main pass in the great ravine, and it now followed its own perilous course at the bottom of a lesser cleft among the higher regions of the Ephel Duath. Dimly the hobbits could discern tall piers and jagged pinnacles of stone on either side, between which were great crevices and fissures blacker than the night, where forgotten winters had gnawed and carved the sunless stone. And now the red light in the sky seemed stronger; though they could not tell whether a dreadful morning were indeed coming to this place of shadow, or whether they saw only the flame of some great violence of Sauron in the torment of Gorgoroth beyond. Still far ahead, and still high above, Frodo, looking up, saw, as he guessed, the very crown of this bitter road. Against the sullen redness of the eastern sky a cleft was outlined in the topmost ridge, narrow, deep-cloven between two black shoulders; and on either shoulder was a horn of stone.\n\nHe paused and looked more attentively. The horn upon the left was tall and slender; and in it burned a red light, or else the red light in the land beyond was shining through a hole. He saw now: it was a black tower poised above the outer pass. He touched Sam's arm and pointed.\n\n'I don't like the look of that!' said Sam. 'So this secret way of yours is guarded after all,' he growled, turning to Gollum. 'As you knew all along, I suppose?'\n\n'All ways are watched, yes,' said Gollum. 'Of course they are. But hobbits must try some way. This may be least watched. Perhaps they've all gone away to big battle, perhaps!'\n\n'Perhaps,' grunted Sam. 'Well, it still seems a long way off, and a long way up before we get there. And there's still the tunnel. I think you ought to rest now, Mr. Frodo. I don't know what time of day or night it is, but we've kept going for hours and hours.'\n\n'Yes, we must rest,' said Frodo. 'Let us find some corner out of the wind, and gather our strength \u0426 for the last lap.' For so he felt it to be. The terrors of the land beyond, and the deed to be done there, seemed remote, too far off yet to trouble him. All his mind was bent on getting through or over this impenetrable wall and guard. If once he could do that impossible thing, then somehow the errand would be accomplished, or so it seemed to him in that dark hour of weariness, still labouring in the stony shadows under Cirith Ungol.\n\nIn a dark crevice between two great piers of rock they sat down: Frodo and Sam a little way within, and Gollum crouched upon the ground near the opening. There the hobbits took what they expected would be their last meal before they went down into the Nameless Land, maybe the last meal they would ever eat together. Some of the food of Gondor they ate, and wafers of the waybread of the Elves, and they drank a little. But of their water they were sparing and took only enough to moisten their dry mouths.\n\n'I wonder when we'll find water again?' said Sam. 'But I suppose even over there they drink? Orcs drink, don't they?'\n\n'Yes, they drink,' said Frodo. 'But do not let us speak of that. Such drink is not for us.'\n\n'Then all the more need to fill our bottles,' said Sam. 'But there isn't any water up here: not a sound or a trickle have I heard. And anyway Faramir said we were not to drink any water in Morgul.'\n\n'No water flowing out of Imlad Morgul, were his words,' said Frodo. 'We are not in that valley now, and if we came on a spring it would be flowing into it and not out of it.'\n\n'I wouldn't trust it,' said Sam, 'not till I was dying of thirst. There's a wicked feeling about this place.' He sniffed. 'And a smell, I fancy. Do you notice it? A queer kind of a smell, stuffy. I don't like it.'\n\n'I don't like anything here at all,' said Frodo, 'step or stone, breath or bone. Earth, air and water all seem accursed. But so our path is laid.'\n\n'Yes, that's so,' said Sam. 'And we shouldn't be here at all, if we'd known more about it before we started. But I suppose it's often that way. The brave things in the old tales and songs, Mr. Frodo: adventures, as I used to call them. I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might say. But that's not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually \u0426 their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. And if they had, we shouldn't know, because they'd have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on \u0426 and not all to a good end, mind you; at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. You know, coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same \u0426 like old Mr Bilbo. But those aren't always the best tales to hear, though they may be the best tales to get landed in! I wonder what sort of a tale we've fallen into?'\n\n'I wonder,' said Frodo. 'But I don't know. And that's the way of a real tale. Take any one that you're fond of. You may know, or guess, what kind of a tale it is, happy-ending or sad-ending, but the people in it don't know. And you don't want them to.'\n\n'No, sir, of course not. Beren now, he never thought he was going to get that Silmaril from the Iron Crown in Thangorodrim, and yet he did, and that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours. But that's a long tale, of course, and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond it \u0426 and the Silmaril went on and came to Earendil. And why, sir, I never thought of that before! We've got \u0426 you've got some of the light of it in that star-glass that the Lady gave you! Why, to think of it, we're in the same tale still! It's going on. Don't the great tales never end?'\n\n'No, they never end as tales,' said Frodo. 'But the people in them come, and go when their part's ended. Our part will end later \u0426 or sooner.'\n\n'And then we can have some rest and some sleep,' said Sam. He laughed grimly. 'And I mean just that, Mr. Frodo. I mean plain ordinary rest, and sleep, and waking up to a morning's work in the garden. I'm afraid that's all I'm hoping for all the time. All the big important plans are not for my sort. Still, I wonder if we shall ever be put into songs or tales. We're in one, or course; but I mean: put into words, you know, told by the fireside, or read out of a great big book with red and black letters, years and years afterwards. And people will say: \"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring! \" And they'll say: \"Yes, that's one of my favourite stories. Frodo was very brave. wasn't he, dad?\" \"Yes, my boy, the famousest of the hobbits, and that's saying a lot.\"'\n\n'It's saying a lot too much,' said Frodo, and he laughed, a long clear laugh from his heart. Such a sound had not been heard in those places since Sauron came to Middle-earth. To Sam suddenly it seemed as if all the stones were listening and the tall rocks leaning over them. But Frodo did not heed them; he laughed again. 'Why, Sam,' he said, 'to hear you somehow makes me as merry as if the story was already written. But you've left out one of the chief characters: Samwise the stouthearted. \"I want to hear more about Sam, dad. Why didn't they put in more of his talk, dad? That's what I like, it makes me laugh. And Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam, would he, dad? \"'\n\n'Now, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, 'you shouldn't make fun. I was serious.'\n\n'So was I,' said Frodo, 'and so I am. We're going on a bit too fast. You and I, Sam, are still stuck in the worst places of the story, and it is all too likely that some will say at this point: \"Shut the book now, dad; we don't want to read any more.\"'\n\n'Maybe,' said Sam, 'but I wouldn't be one to say that. Things done and over and made into part of the great tales are different. Why, even Gollum might be good in a tale, better than he is to have by you, anyway. And he used to like tales himself once, by his own account. I wonder if he thinks he's the hero or the villain?\n\n'Gollum!' he called. 'Would you like to be the hero \u0426 now where's he got to again?'\n\nThere was no sign of him at the mouth of their shelter nor in the shadows near. He had refused their food, though he had, as usual, accepted a mouthful of water; and then he had seemed to curl up for a sleep. They had supposed that one at any rate of his objects in his long absence the day before had been to hunt for food to his own liking; and now he had evidently slipped off again while they talked. But what for this time?\n\n'I don't like his sneaking off without saying,' said Sam. 'And least of all now. He can't be looking for food up here, not unless there's some kind of rock he fancies. Why, there isn't even a bit of moss!'\n\n'It's no good worrying about him now,' said Frodo. 'We couldn't have got so far, not even within sight of the pass, without him, and so we'll have to put up with his ways. If he's false, he's false.'\n\n'All the same, I'd rather have him under my eye,' said Sam. 'All the more so, if he's false. Do you remember he never would say if this pass was guarded or no? And now we see a tower there \u0426 and it may be deserted, and it may not. Do you think he's gone to fetch them, Orcs or whatever they are?'\n\n'No, I don't think so,' answered Frodo. 'Even if he's up to some wickedness, and I suppose that's not unlikely, I don't think it's that: not to fetch Orcs, or any servants of the Enemy. Why wait till now, and go through all the labour of the climb, and come so near the land he fears? He could probably have betrayed us to Orcs many times since we met him. No, if it's anything, it will be some little private trick of his own \u0426 that he thinks is quite secret.'\n\n'Well, I suppose you're right, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. 'Not that it comforts me mightily. I don't make no mistake: I don't doubt he'd hand me over to Orcs as gladly as kiss his hand. But I was forgetting \u0426 his Precious. No, I suppose the whole time it's been The Precious for poor Smeagol. That's the one idea in all his little schemes, if he has any. But how bringing us up here will help him in that is more than I can guess.'\n\n'Very likely he can't guess himself,' said Frodo. 'And I don't think he's got just one plain scheme in his muddled head. I think he really is in part trying to save the Precious from the Enemy, as long as he can. For that would be the last disaster for himself too. if the Enemy got it. And in the other part, perhaps, he's just biding his time and waiting on chance.'\n\n'Yes, Slinker and Stinker, as I've said before,' said Sam. 'But the nearer they get to the Enemy's land the more like Stinker Slinker will get. Mark my words: if ever we get to the pass, he won't let us really take the precious thing over the border without making some kind of trouble.'\n\n'We haven't got there yet,' said Frodo.\n\n'No, but we'd better keep our eyes skinned till we do. If we're caught napping, Stinker will come out on top pretty quick. Not but what it would be safe for you to have a wink now, master. Safe, if you lay close to me. I'd be dearly glad to see you have a sleep. I'd keep watch over you; and anyway, if you lay near, with my arm round you, no one could come pawing you without your Sam knowing it.'\n\n'Sleep!' said Frodo and sighed, as if out of a desert he had seen a mirage of cool green. 'Yes, even here I could sleep.'\n\n'Sleep then, master! Lay your head in my lap.'\n\nAnd so Gollum found them hours later, when he returned, crawling and creeping down the path out of the gloom ahead. Sam sat propped against the stone, his head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy. In his lap lay Frodo's head, drowned deep in sleep; upon his white forehead lay one of Sam's brown hands, and the other lay softly upon his master's breast. Peace was in both their faces.\n\nGollum looked at them. A strange expression passed over his lean hungry face. The gleam faded from his eyes, and they went dim and grey, old and tired. A spasm of pain seemed to twist him, and he turned away, peering back up towards the pass, shaking his head, as if engaged in some interior debate. Then he came back, and slowly putting out a trembling hand, very cautiously he touched Frodo's knee \u0426 but almost the touch was a caress. For a fleeting moment, could one of the sleepers have seen him, they would have thought that they beheld an old weary hobbit, shrunken by the years that had carried him far beyond his time, beyond friends and kin, and the fields and streams of youth, an old starved pitiable thing.\n\nBut at that touch Frodo stirred and cried out softly in his sleep, and immediately Sam was wide awake. The first thing he saw was Gollum \u0426 'pawing at master,' as he thought.\n\n'Hey you!' he said roughly. 'What are you up to?'\n\n'Nothing, nothing,' said Gollum softly. 'Nice Master!'\n\n'I daresay,' said Sam. 'But where have you been to \u0426 sneaking off and sneaking back, you old villain?'\n\nGollum withdrew himself, and a green glint flickered under his heavy lids. Almost spider-like he looked now, crouched back on his bent limbs, with his protruding eyes. The fleeting moment had passed, beyond recall. 'Sneaking, sneaking!' he hissed. 'Hobbits always so polite, yes. O nice hobbits! Smeagol brings them up secret ways that nobody else could find. Tired he is, thirsty he is, yes thirsty; and he guides them and he searches for paths, and they say sneak, sneak. Very nice friends, O yes my precious, very nice.'\n\nSam felt a bit remorseful, though not more trustful. 'Sorry,' he said. 'I'm sorry, but you startled me out of my sleep. And I shouldn't have been sleeping, and that made me a bit sharp. But Mr. Frodo, he's that tired, I asked him to have a wink; and well, that's how it is. Sorry. But where have you been to?'\n\n'Sneaking,' said Gollum, and the green glint did not leave his eyes.\n\n'O very well,' said Sam, 'have it your own way! I don't suppose it's so far from the truth. And now we'd better all be sneaking along together. What's the time? Is it today or tomorrow?'\n\n'It's tomorrow,' said Gollum, 'or this was tomorrow when hobbits went to sleep. Very foolish, very dangerous \u0426 if poor Smeagol wasn't sneaking about to watch.'\n\n'I think we shall get tired of that word soon,' said Sam. 'But never mind. I'll wake master up.' Gently he smoothed the hair back from Frodo's brow, and bending down spoke softly to him.\n\n'Wake up, Mr. Frodo! Wake up!'\n\nFrodo stirred and opened his eyes, and smiled, seeing Sam's face bending over him. 'Calling me early aren't you, Sam?' he said. 'It's dark still!'\n\n'Yes it's always dark here,' said Sam. 'But Gollum's come back Mr. Frodo, and he says it's tomorrow. So we must be walking on. The last lap.'\n\nFrodo drew a deep breath and sat up. 'The last lap!' he said. 'Hullo, Smeagol! Found any food? Have you had any rest?'\n\n'No food, no rest, nothing for Smeagol,' said Gollum. 'He's a sneak.'\n\nSam clicked his tongue, but restrained himself.\n\n'Don't take names to yourself, Smeagol,' said Frodo. 'It's unwise whether they are true or false.'\n\n'Smeagol has to take what's given him,' answered Gollum. 'He was given that name by kind Master Samwise, the hobbit that knows so much.'\n\nFrodo looked at Sam. 'Yes sir,' he said. 'I did use the word, waking up out of my sleep sudden and all and finding him at hand. I said I was sorry, but I soon shan't be.'\n\n'Come, let it pass then,' said Frodo. 'But now we seem to have come to the point, you and I, Smeagol. Tell me. Can we find the rest of the way by ourselves? We're in sight of the pass, of a way in, and if we can find it now, then I suppose our agreement can be said to be over. You have done what you promised, and you're free: free to go back to food and rest, wherever you wish to go, except to servants of the Enemy. And one day I may reward you, I or those that remember me.'\n\n'No, no, not yet,' Gollum whined. 'O no! They can't find the way themselves, can they? O no indeed. There's the tunnel coming. Smeagol must go on. No rest. No food. Not yet.'\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nShelob's Lair\n\nIt may indeed have been daytime now, as Gollum said, but the hobbits could see little difference, unless, perhaps, the heavy sky above was less utterly black, more like a great roof of smoke; while instead of the darkness of deep night, which lingered still in cracks and holes, a grey blurring shadow shrouded the stony world about them. They passed on, Gollum in front and the hobbits now side by side, up the long ravine between the piers and columns of torn and weathered rock, standing like huge unshapen statues on either hand. There was no sound. Some way ahead, a mile or so, perhaps, was a great grey wall, a last huge upthrusting mass of mountain-stone. Darker it loomed, and steadily it rose as they approached, until it towered up high above them, shutting out the view of all that lay beyond. Deep shadow lay before its feet. Sam sniffed the air.\n\n'Ugh! That smell!' he said. 'It's getting stronger and stronger.'\n\nPresently they were under the shadow, and there in the midst of it they saw the opening of a cave. 'This is the way in,' said Gollum softly. 'This is the entrance to the tunnel.' He did not speak its name: Torech Ungol, Shelob's Lair. Out of it came a stench, not the sickly odour of decay in the meads of Morgul, but a foul reek, as if filth unnameable were piled and hoarded in the dark within.\n\n'Is this the only way, Smeagol?' said Frodo.\n\n'Yes, yes,' he answered. 'Yes, we must go this way now.'\n\n'D'you mean to say you've been through this hole?' said Sam. 'Phew! But perhaps you don't mind bad smells.'\n\nGollum's eyes glinted. 'He doesn't know what we minds, does he precious? No, he doesn't. But Smeagol can bear things. Yes. He's been through. O yes, right through. It's the only way.'\n\n'And what makes the smell, I wonder,' said Sam. 'It's like \u0426 well, I wouldn't like to say. Some beastly hole of the Orcs, I'll warrant, with a hundred years of their filth in it.'\n\n'Well,' said Frodo, 'Orcs or no, if it's the only way, we must take it.'\n\nDrawing a deep breath they passed inside. In a few steps they were in utter and impenetrable dark. Not since the lightless passages of Moria had Frodo or Sam known such darkness, and if possible here it was deeper and denser. There, there were airs moving, and echoes, and a sense of space. Here the air was still, stagnant, heavy, and sound fell dead. They walked as it were in a black vapour wrought of veritable darkness itself that, as it was breathed, brought blindness not only to the eyes but to the mind, so that even the memory of colours and of forms and of any light faded out of thought. Night always had been, and always would be, and night was all.\n\nBut for a while they could still feel, and indeed the senses of their feet and fingers at first seemed sharpened almost painfully. The walls felt, to their surprise, smooth, and the floor, save for a step now and again, was straight and even, going ever up at the same stiff slope. The tunnel was high and wide, so wide that, though the hobbits walked abreast, only touching the side-walls with their outstretched hands, they were separated, cut off alone in the darkness.\n\nGollum had gone in first and seemed to be only a few steps ahead. While they were still able to give heed to such things, they could hear his breath hissing and gasping just in front of them. But after a time their senses became duller, both touch and hearing seemed to grow numb, and they kept on, groping, walking, on and on, mainly by the force of the will with which they had entered, will to go through and desire to come at last to the high gate beyond.\n\nBefore they had gone very far, perhaps, but time and distance soon passed out of his reckoning, Sam on the right, feeling the wall, was aware that there was an opening at the side: for a moment he caught a faint breath of some air less heavy, and then they passed it by.\n\n'There's more than one passage here,' he whispered with an effort: it seemed hard to make his breath give any sound. 'It's as orc-like a place as ever there could be!'\n\nAfter that, first he on the right, and then Frodo on the left, passed three or four such openings, some wider, some smaller; but there was as yet no doubt of the main way, for it was straight, and did not turn, and still went steadily up. But how long was it, how much more of this would they have to endure, or could they endure? The breathlessness of the air was growing as they climbed; and now they seemed often in the blind dark to sense some resistance thicker than the foul air. As they thrust forward they felt things brush against their heads, or against their hands, long tentacles, or hanging growths perhaps: they could not tell what they were. And still the stench grew. It grew, until almost it seemed to them that smell was the only clear sense left to them, and that was for their torment. One hour, two hours, three hours: how many had they passed in this lightless hole? Hours \u0426 days, weeks rather. Sam left the tunnel-side and shrank towards Frodo, and their hands met and clasped, and so together they still went on.\n\nAt length Frodo, groping along the left-hand wall, came suddenly to a void. Almost he fell sideways into the emptiness. Here was some opening in the rock far wider than any they had yet passed; and out of it came a reek so foul, and a sense of lurking malice so intense, that Frodo reeled. And at that moment Sam too lurched and fell forwards.\n\nFighting off both the sickness and the fear, Frodo gripped Sam's hand. 'Up!' he said in a hoarse breath without voice. 'It all comes from here, the stench and the peril. Now for it! Quick!'\n\nCalling up his remaining strength and resolution, he dragged Sam to his feet, and forced his own limbs to move. Sam stumbled beside him. One step, two steps, three steps-at last six steps. Maybe they had passed the dreadful unseen opening, but whether that was so or not, suddenly it was easier to move, as if some hostile will for the moment had released them. They struggled on, still hand in hand.\n\nBut almost at once they came to a new difficulty. The tunnel forked, or so it seemed, and in the dark they could not tell which was the wider way, or which kept nearer to the straight. Which should they take, the left, or the right? They knew of nothing to guide them, yet a false choice would almost certainly be fatal.\n\n'Which way has Gollum gone?' panted Sam. 'And why didn't he wait?'\n\n'Smeagol!' said Frodo, trying to call. 'Smeagol!' But his voice croaked, and the name fell dead almost as it left his lips. There was no answer, not an echo, not even a tremor of the air.\n\n'He's really gone this time, I fancy,' muttered Sam. 'I guess this is just exactly where he meant to bring us. Gollum! If ever I lay hands on you again, you'll be sorry for it.'\n\nPresently, groping and fumbling in the dark, they found that the opening on the left was blocked: either it was a blind, or else some great stone had fallen in the passage. 'This can't be the way,' Frodo whispered. 'Right or wrong, we must take the other.'\n\n'And quick!' Sam panted. 'There's something worse than Gollum about. I can feel something looking at us.'\n\nThey had not gone more than a few yards when from behind them came a sound, startling and horrible in the heavy padded silence: a gurgling, bubbling noise, and a long venomous hiss. They wheeled round, but nothing could be seen. Still as stones they stood, staring, waiting for they did not know what.\n\n'It's a trap!' said Sam, and he laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword; and as he did so, he thought of the darkness of the barrow whence it came. 'I wish old Tom was near us now!' he thought. Then as he stood, darkness about him and a blackness of despair and anger in his heart. it seemed to him that he saw a light: a light in his mind, almost unbearably bright at first, as a sun-ray to the eyes of one long hidden in a windowless pit. Then the light became colour: green, gold, silver, white. Far off, as in a little picture drawn by elven-fingers he saw the Lady Galadriel standing on the grass in Lorien, and gifts were in her hands. And you, Ring-bearer, he heard her say, remote but clear, for you I have prepared this.\n\nThe bubbling hiss drew nearer, and there was a creaking as of some great jointed thing that moved with slow purpose in the dark. A reek came on before it. 'Master, master!' cried Sam, and the life and urgency came back into his voice. 'The Lady's gift! The star-glass! A light to you in dark places, she said it was to be. The star-glass!'\n\n'The star-glass?' muttered Frodo, as one answering out of sleep, hardly comprehending. 'Why yes! Why had I forgotten it? A light when all other lights go out! And now indeed light alone can help us.'\n\nSlowly his hand went to his bosom, and slowly he held aloft the Phial of Galadriel. For a moment it glimmered, faint as a rising star struggling in heavy earthward mists, and then as its power waxed, and hope grew in Frodo's mind, it began to burn, and kindled to a silver flame, a minute heart of dazzling light, as though Earendil had himself come down from the high sunset paths with the last Silmaril upon his brow. The darkness receded from it until it seemed to shine in the centre of a globe of airy crystal, and the hand that held it sparkled with white fire.\n\nFrodo gazed in wonder at this marvellous gift that he had so long carried, not guessing its full worth and potency. Seldom had he remembered it on the road, until they came to Morgul Vale, and never had he used it for fear of its revealing light. Aiya Earendil Elenion Ancalima! he cried, and knew not what he had spoken; for it seemed that another voice spoke through his, clear, untroubled by the foul air of the pit.\n\nBut other potencies there are in Middle-earth, powers of night, and they are old and strong. And She that walked in the darkness had heard the Elves cry that cry far back in the deeps of time, and she had not heeded it, and it did not daunt her now. Even as Frodo spoke he felt a great malice bent upon him, and a deadly regard considering him. Not far down the tunnel, between them and the opening where they had reeled and stumbled, he was aware of eyes growing visible, two great clusters of many-windowed eyes \u0426 the coming menace was unmasked at last. The radiance of the star-glass was broken and thrown back from their thousand facets, but behind the glitter a pale deadly fire began steadily to glow within, a flame kindled in some deep pit of evil thought. Monstrous and abominable eyes they were, bestial and yet filled with purpose and with hideous delight, gloating over their prey trapped beyond all hope of escape.\n\nFrodo and Sam, horror-stricken, began slowly to back away, their own gaze held by the dreadful stare of those baleful eyes; but as they backed so the eyes advanced. Frodo's hand wavered, and slowly the Phial drooped. Then suddenly, released from the holding spell to run a little while in vain panic for the amusement of the eyes, they both turned and fled together; but even as they ran Frodo looked back and saw with terror that at once the eyes came leaping up behind. The stench of death was like a cloud about him.\n\n'Stand! stand!' he cried desperately. 'Running is no use.'\n\nSlowly the eyes crept nearer.\n\n'Galadriel!' he called, and gathering his courage he lifted up the Phial once more. The eyes halted. For a moment their regard relaxed, as if some hint of doubt troubled them. Then Frodo's heart flamed within him, and without thinking what he did, whether it was folly or despair or courage, he took the Phial in his left hand, and with his right hand drew his sword. Sting flashed out, and the sharp elven-blade sparkled in the silver light, but at its edges a blue fire flicked. Then holding the star aloft and the bright sword advanced, Frodo, hobbit of the Shire, walked steadily down to meet the eyes.\n\nThey wavered. Doubt came into them as the light approached. One by one they dimmed, and slowly they drew back. No brightness so deadly had ever afflicted them before. From sun and moon and star they had been safe underground, but now a star had descended into the very earth. Still it approached, and the eyes began to quail. One by one they all went dark; they turned away, and a great bulk, beyond the light's reach, heaved its huge shadow in between. They were gone.\n\n'Master, master!' cried Sam. He was close behind, his own sword drawn and ready. 'Stars and glory! But the Elves would make a song of that, if ever they heard of it! And may I live to tell them and hear them sing. But don't go on, master. Don't go down to that den! Now's our only chance. Now let's get out of this foul hole!'\n\nAnd so back they turned once more, first walking and then running; for as they went the floor of the tunnel rose steeply, and with every stride they climbed higher above the stenches of the unseen lair, and strength returned to limb and heart. But still the hatred of the Watcher lurked behind them, blind for a while, perhaps, but undefeated, still bent on death. And now there came a flow of air to meet them, cold and thin. The opening, the tunnel's end, at last it was before them. Panting, yearning for a roofless place, they flung themselves forward, and then in amazement they staggered, tumbling back. The outlet was blocked with some barrier, but not of stone: soft and a little yielding it seemed, and yet strong and impervious; air filtered through, but not a glimmer of any light. Once more they charged and were hurled back.\n\nHolding aloft the Phial Frodo looked and before him he saw a greyness which the radiance of the star-glass did not pierce and did not illuminate, as if it were a shadow that being cast by no light, no light could dissipate. Across the width and height of the tunnel a vast web was spun, orderly as the web of some huge spider, but denser-woven and far greater, and each thread was as thick as rope.\n\nSam laughed grimly. 'Cobwebs!' he said. 'Is that all? Cobwebs! But what a spider! Have at 'em, down with 'em!'\n\nIn a fury he hewed at them with his sword, but the thread that he struck did not break. It gave a little and then sprang back like a plucked bowstring, turning the blade and tossing up both sword and arm. Three times Sam struck with all his force, and at last one single cord of all the countless cords snapped and twisted, curling and whipping through the air. One end of it lashed Sam's hand, and he cried out in pain, starting back and drawing his hand across his mouth.\n\n'It will take days to clear the road like this,' he said. 'What's to be done? Have those eyes come back?'\n\n'No, not to be seen,' said Frodo. 'But I still feel that they are looking at me, or thinking about me: making some other plan, perhaps. If this light were lowered, or if it failed, they would quickly come again.'\n\n'Trapped in the end!' said Sam bitterly, his anger rising again above weariness and despair. 'Gnats in a net. May the curse of Faramir bite that Gollum and bite him quick!'\n\n'That would not help us now,' said Frodo. 'Come! Let us see what Sting can do. It is an elven-blade. There were webs of horror in the dark ravines of Beleriand where it was forged. But you must be the guard and hold back the eyes. Here, take the star-glass. Do not be afraid. Hold it up and watch!'\n\nThen Frodo stepped up to the great grey net, and hewed it with a wide sweeping stroke, drawing the bitter edge swiftly across a ladder of close-strung cords, and at once springing away. The blue-gleaming blade shore through them like a scythe through grass, and they leaped and writhed and then hung loose. A great rent was made.\n\nStroke after stroke he dealt, until at last all the web within his reach was shattered, and the upper portion blew and swayed like a loose veil in the incoming wind. The trap was broken.\n\n'Come!' cried Frodo. 'On! On!' Wild joy at their escape from the very mouth of despair suddenly filled all his mind. His head whirled as with a draught of potent wine. He sprang out, shouting as he came.\n\nIt seemed light in that dark land to his eyes that had passed through the den of night. The great smokes had risen and grown thinner, and the last hours of a sombre day were passing; the red glare of Mordor had died away in sullen gloom. Yet it seemed to Frodo that he looked upon a morning of sudden hope. Almost he had reached the summit of the wall. Only a little higher now. The Cleft, Cirith Ungol, was before him, a dim notch in the black ridge, and the horns of rock darkling in the sky on either side. A short race, a sprinter's course and he would be through!\n\n'The pass, Sam!' he cried, not heeding the shrillness of his voice, that released from the choking airs of the tunnel rang out now high and wild. 'The pass! Run, run, and we'll be through \u0426 through before any one can stop us!'\n\nSam came up behind as fast as he could urge his legs; but glad as he was to be free, he was uneasy, and as he ran, he kept on glancing back at the dark arch of the tunnel, fearing to see eyes, or some shape beyond his imagining, spring out in pursuit. Too little did he or his master know of the craft of Shelob. She had many exits from her lair.\n\nThere agelong she had dwelt, an evil thing in spider-form, even such as once of old had lived in the Land of the Elves in the West that is now under the Sea, such as Beren fought in the Mountains of Terror in Doriath, and so came to Luthien upon the green sward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight long ago. How Shelob came there, flying from ruin, no tale tells, for out of the Dark Years few tales have come. But still she was there, who was there before Sauron, and before the first stone of Barad-dur; and she served none but herself, drinking the blood of Elves and Men, bloated and grown fat with endless brooding on her feasts, weaving webs of shadow; for all living things were her food, and her vomit darkness. Far and wide her lesser broods, bastards of the miserable mates, her own offspring, that she slew, spread from glen to glen, from the Ephel Duath to the eastern hills, to Dol Guldur and the fastnesses of Mirkwood. But none could rival her, Shelob the Great, last child of Ungoliant to trouble the unhappy world.\n\nAlready, years before, Gollum had beheld her, Smeagol who pried into all dark holes, and in past days he had bowed and worshipped her, and the darkness of her evil will walked through all the ways of his weariness beside him, cutting him off from light and from regret. And he had promised to bring her food. But her lust was not his lust. Little she knew of or cared for towers, or rings, or anything devised by mind or hand, who only desired death for all others, mind and body, and for herself a glut of life, alone, swollen till the mountains could no longer hold her up and the darkness could not contain her.\n\nBut that desire was yet far away, and long now had she been hungry, lurking in her den, while the power of Sauron grew, and light and living things forsook his borders; and the city in the valley was dead, and no Elf or Man came near, only the unhappy Orcs. Poor food and wary. But she must eat, and however busily they delved new winding passages from the pass and from their tower, ever she found some way to snare them. But she lusted for sweeter meat. And Gollum had brought it to her.\n\n'We'll see, we'll see,' he said often to himself, when the evil mood was on him, as he walked the dangerous road from Emyn Muil to Morgul Vale, 'we'll see. It may well be, O yes, it may well be that when She throws away the bones and the empty garments, we shall find it, we shall get it, the Precious, a reward for poor Smeagol who brings nice food. And we'll save the Precious, as we promised. O yes. And when we've got it safe, then She'll know it, O yes, then we'll pay Her back, my precious. Then we'll pay everyone back!'\n\nSo he thought in an inner chamber of his cunning, which he still hoped to hide from her, even when he had come to her again and had bowed low before her while his companions slept.\n\nAnd as for Sauron: he knew where she lurked. It pleased him that she should dwell there hungry but unabated in malice, a more sure watch upon that ancient path into his land than any other that his skill could have devised. And Orcs, they were useful slaves, but he had them in plenty. If now and again Shelob caught them to stay her appetite, she was welcome: he could spare them. And sometimes as a man may cast a dainty to his cat (his cat he calls her, but she owns him not) Sauron would send her prisoners that he had no better uses for: he would have them driven to her hole, and report brought back to him of the play she made.\n\nSo they both lived, delighting in their own devices, and feared no assault, nor wrath, nor any end of their wickedness. Never yet had any fly escaped from Shelob's webs, and the greater now was her rage and hunger.\n\nBut nothing of this evil which they had stirred up against them did poor Sam know, except that a fear was growing on him, a menace which he could not see; and such a weight did it become that it was a burden to him to run, and his feet seemed leaden.\n\nDread was round him, and enemies before him in the pass, and his master was in a fey mood running heedlessly to meet them. Turning his eyes away from the shadow behind and the deep gloom beneath the cliff upon his left, he looked ahead, and he saw two things that increased his dismay. He saw that the sword which Frodo still held unsheathed was glittering with blue flame; and he saw that though the sky behind was now dark, still the window in the tower was glowing red.\n\n'Orcs!' he muttered. 'We'll never rush it like this. There's Orcs about, and worse than Orcs.' Then returning quickly to his long habit of secrecy, he closed his hand about the precious Phial which he still bore. Red with his own living blood his hand shone for a moment, and then he thrust the revealing light deep into a pocket near his breast and drew his elven-cloak about him. Now he tried to quicken his pace. His master was gaining on him; already he was some twenty strides ahead, flitting on like a shadow; soon he would be lost to sight in that grey world.\n\nHardly had Sam hidden the light of the star-glass when she came. A little way ahead and to his left he saw suddenly, issuing from a black hole of shadow under the cliff, the most loathly shape that he had ever beheld, horrible beyond the horror of an evil dream. Most like a spider she was, but huger than the great hunting beasts, and more terrible than they because of the evil purpose in her remorseless eyes. Those same eyes that he had thought daunted and defeated, there they were lit with a fell light again, clustering in her out-thrust head. Great horns she had, and behind her short stalk-like neck was her huge swollen body, a vast bloated bag, swaying and sagging between her legs; its great bulk was black, blotched with livid marks, but the belly underneath was pale and luminous and gave forth a stench. Her legs were bent, with great knobbed joints high above her back, and hairs that stuck out like steel spines, and at each leg's end there was a claw.\n\nAs soon as she had squeezed her soft squelching body and its folded limbs out of the upper exit from her lair, she moved with a horrible speed, now running on her creaking legs, now making a sudden bound. She was between Sam and his master. Either she did not see Sam, or she avoided him for the moment as the bearer of the light, and fixed all her intent upon one prey, upon Frodo, bereft of his Phial, running heedless up the path, unaware yet of his peril. Swiftly he ran, but Shelob was swifter; in a few leaps she would have him.\n\nSam gasped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout. 'Look out behind!' he yelled. 'Look out master! I'm' \u0426 but suddenly his cry was stifled.\n\nA long clammy hand went over his mouth and another caught him by the neck, while something wrapped itself about his leg. Taken off his guard he toppled backwards into the arms of his attacker.\n\n'Got him!' hissed Gollum in his ear. 'At last, my precious, we've got him, yes, the nassty hobbit. We takes this one. She'll get the other. O yes, Shelob will get him, not Smeagol: he promised; he won't hurt Master at all. But he's got you, you nassty filthy little sneak!' He spat on Sam's neck.\n\nFury at the treachery, and desperation at the delay when his master was in deadly peril, gave to Sam a sudden violence and strength that was far beyond anything that Gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit, as he thought him. Not Gollum himself could have twisted more quickly or more fiercely. His hold on Sam's mouth slipped, and Sam ducked and lunged forward again, trying to tear away from the grip on his neck. His sword was still in his hand, and on his left arm, hanging by its thong, was Faramir's staff. Desperately he tried to turn and stab his enemy. But Gollum was too quick. His long right arm shot out, and he grabbed Sam's wrist: his fingers were like a vice; slowly and relentlessly he bent the hand down and forward, till with a cry of pain Sam released the sword and it fell to the ground; and all the while Gollum's other hand was tightening on Sam's throat.\n\nThen Sam played his last trick. With all his strength he pulled away and got his feet firmly planted; then suddenly he drove his legs against the ground and with his whole force hurled himself backwards.\n\nNot expecting even this simple trick from Sam, Gollum fell over with Sam on top, and he received the weight of the sturdy hobbit in his stomach. A sharp hiss came out of him, and for a second his hand upon Sam's throat loosened; but his fingers still gripped the sword-hand. Sam tore himself forward and away, and stood up, and then quickly he wheeled away to his right, pivoted on the wrist held by Gollum. Laying hold of the staff with his left hand, Sam swung it up, and down it came with a whistling crack on Gollum's outstretched arm, just below the elbow.\n\nWith a squeal Gollum let go. Then Sam waded in; not waiting to change the staff from left to right he dealt another savage blow. Quick as a snake Gollum slithered aside, and the stroke aimed at his head fell across his back. The staff cracked and broke. That was enough for him. Grabbing from behind was an old game of his, and seldom had he failed in it. But this time, misled by spite, he had made the mistake of speaking and gloating before he had both hands on his victim's neck. Everything had gone wrong with his beautiful plan, since that horrible light had so unexpectedly appeared in the darkness. And now he was face to face with a furious enemy, little less than his own size. This fight was not for him. Sam swept up his sword from the ground and raised it. Gollum squealed, and springing aside on to all fours, he jumped away in one big bound like a frog. Before Sam could reach him, he was off, running with amazing speed back towards the tunnel.\n\nSword in hand Sam went after him. For the moment he had forgotten everything else but the red fury in his brain and the desire to kill Gollum. But before he could overtake him, Gollum was gone. Then as the dark hole stood before him and the stench came out to meet him, like a clap of thunder the thought of Frodo and the monster smote upon Sam's mind. He spun round, and rushed wildly up the path, calling and calling his master's name. He was too late. So far Gollum's plot had succeeded.\n\n\n\nChapter 10\n\nThe Choices of Master Samwise\n\nFrodo was lying face upward on the ground and the monster was bending over him, so intent upon her victim that she took no heed of Sam and his cries, until he was close at hand. As he rushed up he saw that Frodo was already bound in cords, wound about him from ankle to shoulder, and the monster with her great forelegs was beginning half to lift, half to drag his body away.\n\nOn the near side of him lay, gleaming on the ground, his elven-blade, where it had fallen useless from his grasp. Sam did not wait to wonder what was to be done, or whether he was brave, or loyal, or filled with rage. He sprang forward with a yell, and seized his master's sword in his left hand. Then he charged. No onslaught more fierce was ever seen in the savage world of beasts; where some desperate small creature armed with little teeth alone, will spring upon a tower of horn and hide that stands above its fallen mate.\n\nDisturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his small yell she turned slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him. But almost before she was aware that a fury was upon her greater than any she had known in countless years, the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore away the claw. Sam sprang in, inside the arches of her legs, and with a quick upthrust of his other hand stabbed at the clustered eyes upon her lowered head. One great eye went dark.\n\nNow the miserable creature was right under her, for the moment out of the reach of her sting and of her claws. Her vast belly was above him with its putrid light, and the stench of it almost smote him down. Still his fury held for one more blow, and before she could sink upon him, smothering him and all his little impudence of courage, he slashed the bright elven-blade across her with desperate strength.\n\nBut Shelob was not as dragons are, no softer spot had she save only her eyes. Knobbed and pitted with corruption was her age-old hide, but ever thickened from within with layer on layer of evil growth. The blade scored it with a dreadful gash, but those hideous folds could not be pierced by any strength of men, not though Elf or Dwarf should forge the steel or the hand of Beren or of Turin wield it. She yielded to the stroke, and then heaved up the great bag of her belly high above Sam's head. Poison frothed and bubbled from the wound. Now splaying her legs she drove her huge bulk down on him again. Too soon. For Sam still stood upon his feet, and dropping his own sword, with both hands he held the elven-blade point upwards, fending off that ghastly roof; and so Shelob, with the driving force of her own cruel will, with strength greater than any warrior's hand, thrust herself upon a bitter spike. Deep, deep it pricked, as Sam was crushed slowly to the ground.\n\nNo such anguish had Shelob ever known, or dreamed of knowing, in all her long world of wickedness. Not the doughtiest soldier of old Gondor, nor the most savage Orc entrapped, had ever thus endured her, or set blade to her beloved flesh. A shudder went through her. Heaving up again, wrenching away from the pain, she bent her writhing limbs beneath her and sprang backwards in a convulsive leap.\n\nSam had fallen to his knees by Frodo's head, his senses reeling in the foul stench, his two hands still gripping the hilt of the sword. Through the mist before his eyes he was aware dimly of Frodo's face and stubbornly he fought to master himself and to drag himself out of the swoon that was upon him. Slowly he raised his head and saw her, only a few paces away, eyeing him, her beak drabbling a spittle of venom, and a green ooze trickling from below her wounded eye. There she crouched, her shuddering belly splayed upon the ground, the great bows of her legs quivering, as she gathered herself for another spring \u0426 this time to crush and sting to death: no little bite of poison to still the struggling of her meat; this time to slay and then to rend.\n\nEven as Sam himself crouched, looking at her, seeing his death in her eyes, a thought came to him, as if some remote voice had spoken, and he fumbled in his breast with his left hand, and found what he sought: cold and hard and solid it seemed to his touch in a phantom world of horror, the Phial of Galadriel.\n\n'Galadriel!' he said faintly, and then he heard voices far off but clear: the crying of the Elves as they walked under the stars in the beloved shadows of the Shire, and the music of the Elves as it came through his sleep in the Hall of Fire in the house of Elrond.\n\n\t\tGilthoniel A Elbereth!\n\nAnd then his tongue was loosed and his voice cried in a language which he did not know:\n\n\t\tA Elbereth Gilthoniel\n\t\to menel palan-diriel,\n\t\tle nallon si di'nguruthos!\n\t\tA tiro nin, Fanuilos!\n\nAnd with that he staggered to his feet and was Samwise the hobbit, Hamfast's son, again.\n\n'Now come, you filth!' he cried. 'You've hurt my master, you brute, and you'll pay for it. We're going on; but we'll settle with you first. Come on, and taste it again!'\n\nAs if his indomitable spirit had set its potency in motion, the glass blazed suddenly like a white torch in his hand. It flamed like a star that leaping from the firmament sears the dark air with intolerable light. No such terror out of heaven had ever burned in Shelob's face before. The beams of it entered into her wounded head and scored it with unbearable pain, and the dreadful infection of light spread from eye to eye. She fell back beating the air with her forelegs, her sight blasted by inner lightnings, her mind in agony. Then turning her maimed head away, she rolled aside and began to crawl, claw by claw, towards the opening in the dark cliff behind.\n\nSam came on. He was reeling like a drunken man, but he came on. And Shelob cowed at last, shrunken in defeat, jerked and quivered as she tried to hasten from him. She reached the hole, and squeezing down, leaving a trail of green-yellow slime, she slipped in, even as Sam hewed a last stroke at her dragging legs. Then he fell to the ground.\n\nShelob was gone; and whether she lay long in her lair, nursing her malice and her misery, and in slow years of darkness healed herself from within, rebuilding her clustered eyes, until with hunger like death she spun once more her dreadful snares in the glens of the Mountains of Shadow, this tale does not tell.\n\nSam was left alone. Wearily, as the evening of the Nameless Land fell upon the place of battle, he crawled back to his master.\n\n'Master, dear master,' he said, but Frodo did not speak. As he had run forward, eager, rejoicing to be free, Shelob with hideous speed had come behind and with one swift stroke had stung him in the neck. He lay now pale, and heard no voice, and did not move.\n\n'Master, dear master!' said Sam, and through a long silence waited, listening in vain.\n\nThen as quickly as he could he cut away the binding cords and laid his head upon Frodo's breast and to his mouth, but no stir of life could he find, nor feel the faintest flutter of the heart. Often he chafed his master's hands and feet, and touched his brow, but all were cold.\n\n'Frodo, Mr. Frodo!' he called. 'Don't leave me here alone! It's your Sam calling. Don't go where I can't follow! Wake up, Mr. Frodo! O wake up, Frodo, me dear, me dear. Wake up!'\n\nThen anger surged over hint, and he ran about his master's body in a rage, stabbing the air, and smiting the stones, and shouting challenges. Presently he came back, and bending looked at Frodo's face, pale beneath him in the dusk. And suddenly he saw that he was in the picture that was revealed to him in the mirror of Galadriel in Lorien: Frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Or fast asleep he had thought then. 'He's dead!' he said. 'Not asleep, dead!' And as he said it, as if the words had set the venom to its work again, it seemed to him that the hue of the face grew livid green.\n\nAnd then black despair came down on him, and Sam bowed to the ground, and drew his grey hood over his head, and night came into his heart, and he knew no more.\n\nWhen at last the blackness passed, Sam looked up and shadows were about him; but for how many minutes or hours the world had gone dragging on he could not tell. He was still in the same place, and still his master lay beside him dead. The mountains had not crumbled nor the earth fallen into ruin.\n\n'What shall I do, what shall I do?' he said. 'Did I come all this way with him for nothing?' And then he remembered his own voice speaking words that at the time he did not understand himself, at the beginning of their journey: I have something to do before the end. I must see it through, sir, if you understand.\n\n'But what can I do? Not leave Mr. Frodo dead, unburied on the top of the mountains, and go home? Or go on? Go on?' he repeated, and for a moment doubt and fear shook him. 'Go on? Is that what I've got to do? And leave him?'\n\nThen at last he began to weep; and going to Frodo he composed his body, and folded his cold hands upon his breast, and wrapped his cloak about him; and he laid his own sword at one side, and the staff that Faramir had given at the other.\n\n'If I'm to go on,' he said, 'then I must take your sword, by your leave, Mr. Frodo, but I'll put this one to lie by you, as it lay by the old king in the barrow; and you've got your beautiful mithril coat from old Mr. Bilbo. And your star-glass, Mr. Frodo, you did lend it to me and I'll need it, for I'll be always in the dark now. It's too good for me, and the Lady gave it to you, but maybe she'd understand. Do you understand, Mr. Frodo? I've got to go on.'\n\nBut he could not go, not yet. He knelt and held Frodo's hand and could not release it. And time went by and still he knelt, holding his master's hand, and in his heart keeping a debate.\n\nNow he tried to find strength to tear himself away and go on a lonely journey \u0426 for vengeance. If once he could go, his anger would bear him down all the roads of the world, pursuing, until he had him at last: Gollum. Then Gollum would die in a corner. But that was not what he had set out to do. It would not be worth while to leave his master for that. It would not bring him back. Nothing would. They had better both be dead together. And that too would be a lonely journey.\n\nHe looked on the bright point of the sword. He thought of the places behind where there was a black brink and an empty fall into nothingness. There was no escape that way. That was to do nothing, not even to grieve. That was not what he had set out to do. 'What am I to do then?' he cried again, and now he seemed plainly to know the hard answer: see it through. Another lonely journey, and the worst.\n\n'What? Me, alone, go to the Crack of Doom and all?' He quailed still, but the resolve grew. 'What? Me take the Ring from him? The Council gave it to him.'\n\nBut the answer came at once: 'And the Council gave him companions, so that the errand should not fail. And you are the last of all the Company. The errand must not fail.'\n\n'I wish I wasn't the last,' he groaned. 'I wish old Gandalf was here or somebody. Why am I left all alone to make up my mind? I'm sure to go wrong. And it's not for me to go taking the Ring, putting myself forward.'\n\n'But you haven't put yourself forward; you've been put forward. And as for not being the right and proper person, why, Mr. Frodo wasn't as you might say, nor Mr. Bilbo. They didn't choose themselves.'\n\n'Ah well, I must make up my own mind. I will make it up. But I'll be sure to go wrong: that'd be Sam Gamgee all over.\n\n'Let me see now: if we're found here, or Mr. Frodo's found, and that Thing's on him, well, the Enemy will get it. And that's the end of all of us, of Lorien, and Rivendell, and the Shire and all. And there is no time to lose, or it'll be the end anyway. The war's begun, and more than likely things are all going the Enemy's way already. No chance to go back with It and get advice or permission. No, it's sit here till they come and kill me over master's body, and gets It: or take It and go.' He drew a deep breath. 'Then take It, it is!'\n\nHe stooped. Very gently he undid the clasp at the neck and slipped his hand inside Frodo's tunic; then with his other hand raising the head, he kissed the cold forehead, and softly drew the chain over it. And then the head lay quietly back again in rest. No change came over the still face, and by that more than by all other tokens Sam was convinced at last that Frodo had died and laid aside the Quest.\n\n'Good-bye, master, my dear!' he murmured. 'Forgive your Sam. He'll come back to this spot when the job's done \u0426 if he manages it. And then he'll not leave you again. Rest you quiet till I come; and may no foul creature come anigh you! And if the Lady could hear me and give me one wish, I would wish to come back and find you again. Good-bye!'\n\nAnd then he bent his own neck and put the chain upon it, and at once his head was bowed to the ground with the weight of the Ring, as if a great stone had been strung on him. But slowly, as if the weight became less, or new strength grew in him, he raised his head, and then with a great effort got to his feet and found that he could walk and bear his burden. And for a moment he lifted up the Phial and looked down at his master, and the light burned gently now with the soft radiance of the evening-star in summer, and in that light Frodo's face was fair of hue again, pale but beautiful with an elvish beauty, as of one who has long passed the shadows. And with the bitter comfort of that last sight Sam turned and hid the light and stumbled on into the growing dark.\n\nHe had not far to go. The tunnel was some way behind; the Cleft a couple of hundred yards ahead, or less. The path was visible in the dusk' a deep rut worn in ages of passage, running now gently up in a long trough with cliffs on either side. The trough narrowed rapidly. Soon Sam came to a long flight of broad shallow steps. Now the orc-tower was right above him, frowning black, and in it the red eye glowed. Now he was hidden in the dark shadow under it. He was coming to the top of the steps and was in the Cleft at last.\n\n'I've made up my mind,' he kept saying to himself. But he had not. Though he had done his best to think it out, what he was doing was altogether against the grain of his nature. 'Have I got it wrong?' he muttered. 'What ought I to have done?'\n\nAs the sheer sides of the Cleft closed about him, before he reached the actual summit, before he looked at last on the path descending into the Nameless Land, he turned. For a moment, motionless in intolerable doubt, he looked back. He could still see, like a small blot in the gathering gloom, the mouth of the tunnel; and he thought he could see or guess where Frodo lay. He fancied there was a glimmer on the ground down there, or perhaps it was some trick of his tears, as he peered out at that high stony place where all his life had fallen in ruin.\n\n'If only I could have my wish, my one wish,' he sighed, 'to go back and find him!' Then at last he turned to the road in front and took a few steps: the heaviest and the most reluctant he had ever taken.\n\nOnly a few steps; and now only a few more and he would be going down and would never see that high place again. And then suddenly he heard cries and voices. He stood still as stone. Orc-voices. They were behind him and before him. A noise of tramping feet and harsh shouts: Orcs were coming up to the Cleft from the far side, from some entry to the tower, perhaps. Tramping feet and shouts behind. He wheeled round. He saw small red lights, torches, winking away below there as they issued from the tunnel. At last the hunt was up. The red eye of the tower had not been blind. He was caught.\n\nNow the flicker of approaching torches and the clink of steel ahead was very near. In a minute they would reach the top and be on him. He had taken too long in making up his mind, and now it was no good. How could he escape, or save himself, or save the Ring? The Ring. He was not aware of any thought or decision. He simply found himself drawing out the chain and taking the Ring in his hand. The head of the orc-company appeared in the Cleft right before him. Then he put it on.\n\nThe world changed, and a single moment of time was filled with an hour of thought. At once he was aware that hearing was sharpened while sight was dimmed, but otherwise than in Shelob's lair. All things about him now were not dark but vague; while he himself was there in a grey hazy world, alone, like a small black solid rock and the Ring, weighing down his left hand, was like an orb of hot gold. He did not feel invisible at all, but horribly and uniquely visible; and he knew that somewhere an Eye was searching for him.\n\nHe heard the crack of stone, and the murmur of water far off in Morgul Vale; and down away under the rock the bubbling misery of Shelob, groping, lost in some blind passage; and voices in the dungeons of the tower; and the cries of the Orcs as they came out of the tunnel; and deafening, roaring in his ears, the crash of the feet and the rending clamour of the Orcs before him. He shrank against the cliff. But they marched up like a phantom company, grey distorted figures in a mist, only dreams of fear with pale flames in their hands. And they passed him by. He cowered, trying to creep away into some cranny and to hide.\n\nHe listened. The Orcs from the tunnel and the others marching down had sighted one another, and both parties were now hurrying and shouting. He heard them both clearly, and he understood what they said. Perhaps the Ring gave understanding of tongues, or simply understanding, especially of the servants of Sauron its maker, so that if he gave heed, he understood and translated the thought to himself. Certainly the Ring had grown greatly in power as it approached the places of its forging; but one thing it did not confer, and that was courage. At present Sam still thought only of hiding, of lying low till all was quiet again; and he listened anxiously. He could not tell how near the voices were, the words seemed almost in his ears.\n\n'Hola! Gorbag! What are you doing up here? Had enough of war already?'\n\n'Orders, you lubber. And what are you doing, Shagrat? Tired of lurking up there? Thinking of coming down to fight?'\n\n'Orders to you. I'm in command of this pass. So speak civil. What's your report?'\n\n'Nothing.'\n\n'Hai! hai! yoi!' A yell broke into the exchanges of the leaders. The Orcs lower down had suddenly seen something. They began to run. So did the others.\n\n'Hai! Hola! Here's something! Lying right in the road. A spy, a spy!' There was a hoot of snarling horns and a babel of baying voices.\n\nWith a dreadful stroke Sam was wakened from his cowering mood. They had seen his master. What would they do? He had heard tales of the Orcs to make the blood run cold. It could not be borne. He sprang up. He flung the Quest and all his decisions away, and fear and doubt with them. He knew now where his place was and had been: at his master's side, though what he could do there was not clear. Back he ran down the steps, down the path towards Frodo.\n\n'How many are there?' he thought. 'Thirty or forty from the tower at least, and a lot more than that from down below, I guess. How many can I kill before they get me? They'll see the flame of the sword, as soon as I draw it, and they'll get me sooner or later. I wonder if any song will ever mention it: how Samwise fell in the High Pass and made a wall of bodies round his master. No, no song. Of course not, for the Ring'll be found, and there'll be no more songs. I can't help it. My place is by Mr. Frodo. They must understand that \u0426 Elrond and the Council, and the great Lords and Ladies with all their wisdom. Their plans have gone wrong. I can't be their Ring-bearer. Not without Mr. Frodo.'\n\nBut the Orcs were out of his dim sight now. He had had no time to consider himself, but now he realized that he was weary, weary almost to exhaustion: his legs would not carry him as he wished. He was too slow. The path seemed miles long. Where had they all got to in the mist?\n\nThere they were again! A good way ahead still. A cluster of figures round something lying on the ground; a few seemed to be darting this way and that, bent like dogs on a trail. He tried to make a spurt.\n\n'Come on, Sam!' he said, 'or you'll be too late again.' He loosened the sword in its sheath. In a minute he would draw it, and then\u0426\n\nThere was a wild clamour, hooting and laughing, as something was lifted from the ground. 'Ya hoi! Ya harri hoi! Up! Up!'\n\nThen a voice shouted: 'Now off! The quick way. Back to the Undergate! She'll not trouble us tonight by all the signs.' The whole band of orc-figures began to move. Four in the middle were carrying a body high on their shoulders. 'Ya hoi!'\n\nThey had taken Frodo's body. They were off. He could not catch them up. Still he laboured on. The Orcs reached the tunnel and were passing in. Those with the burden went first, and behind them there was a good deal of struggling and jostling. Sam came on. He drew the sword, a flicker of blue in his wavering hand, but they did not see it. Even as he came panting up, the last of them vanished into the black hole.\n\nFor a moment he stood, gasping, clutching his breast. Then he drew his sleeve across his face, wiping away the grime, and sweat, and tears. 'Curse the filth!' he said, and sprang after them into the darkness.\n\nIt no longer seemed very dark to him in the tunnel, rather it was as if he had stepped out of a thin mist into a heavier fog. His weariness was growing but his will hardened all the more. He thought he could see the light of torches a little way ahead, but try as he would, he could not catch them up. Orcs go fast in tunnels, and this tunnel they knew well; for in spite of Shelob they were forced to use it often as the swiftest way from the Dead City over the mountains. In what far-off time the main tunnel and the great round pit had been made, where Shelob had taken up her abode in ages past, they did not know; but many byways they had themselves delved about in on either side, so as to escape the lair in their goings to and fro on the business of their masters. Tonight they did not intend to go far down, but were hastening to find a side-passage that led back to their watch-tower on the cliff. Must of them were gleeful, delighted with what they had found and seen, and as they ran they gabbled and yammered after the fashion of their kind. Sam heard the noise of their harsh voices, flat and hard in the dead air, and he could distinguish two voices from among all the rest: they were louder, and nearer to him. The captains of the two parties seemed to be bringing up the rear, debating as they went.\n\n'Can't you stop your rabble making such a racket, Shagrat?' grunted the one. 'We don't want Shelob on us.'\n\n'Go on, Gorbag! Yours are making more than half the noise,' said the other. 'But let the lads play! No need to worry about Shelob for a bit, I reckon. She's sat on a nail, it seems, and we shan't cry about that. Didn't you see: a nasty mess all the way back to that cursed crack of hers? If we've stopped it once, we've stopped it a hundred times. So let 'em laugh. And we've struck a bit of luck at last: got something that Lugburz wants.'\n\n'Lugburz wants it, eh? What is it, d'you think? Elvish it looked to me, but undersized. What's the danger in a thing like that?'\n\n'Don't know till we've had a look.'\n\n'Oho! So they haven't told you what to expect? They don't tell us all they know, do they? Not by half. But they can make mistakes, even the Top Ones can.'\n\n'Sh, Gorbag!' Shagrat's voice was lowered, so that even with his strangely sharpened hearing Sam could only just catch what was said. 'They may, but they've got eyes and ears everywhere; some among my lot, as like as not. But there's no doubt about it, they're troubled about something. The Nazgul down below are, by your account; and Lugburz is too. Something nearly slipped.'\n\n'Nearly, you say!' said Gorbag.\n\n'All right,' said Shagrat, 'but we'll talk of that later: Wait till we get to the Under-way. There's a place there where we can talk a bit, while the lads go on.'\n\nShortly afterwards Sam saw the torches disappear. Then there was a rumbling noise, and just as he hurried up, a bump. As far as he could guess the Orcs had turned and gone into the very opening which Frodo and he had tried and found blocked. It was still blocked.\n\nThere seemed to be a great stone in the way, but the Orcs had got through somehow, for he could hear their voices on the other side. They were still running along, deeper and deeper into the mountain, back towards the tower. Sam felt desperate. They were carrying off his master's body for some foul purpose and he could not follow. He thrust and pushed at the block, and he threw himself against it, but it did not yield. Then not far inside, or so he thought, he heard the two captains' voices talking again. He stood still listening for a little hoping perhaps to learn something useful. Perhaps Gorbag, who seemed to belong to Minas Morgul, would come out, and he could then slip in.\n\n'No, I don't know,' said Gorbag's voice. 'The messages go through quicker than anything could fly, as a rule. But I don't enquire how it's done. Safest not to. Grr! Those Nazgul give me the creeps. And they skin the body off you as soon as look at you, and leave you all cold in the dark on the other side. But He likes 'em; they're His favourites nowadays, so it's no use grumbling. I tell you, it's no game serving down in the city.'\n\n'You should try being up here with Shelob for company,' said Shagrat.\n\n'I'd like to try somewhere where there's none of 'em. But the war's on now, and when that's over things may be easier.'\n\n'It's going well, they say.'\n\n'They would,' grunted Gorbag. 'We'll see. But anyway, if it does go well, there should be a lot more room. What d'you say? \u0426 if we get a chance, you and me'll slip off and set up somewhere on our own with a few trusty lads, somewhere where there's good loot nice and handy, and no big bosses.'\n\n'Ah!' said Shagrat. 'Like old times.'\n\n'Yes,' said Gorbag. 'But don't count on it. I'm not easy in my mind. As I said, the Big Bosses, ay,' his voice sank almost to a whisper, 'ay, even the Biggest, can make mistakes. Something nearly slipped you say. I say, something has slipped. And we've got to look out. Always the poor Uruks to put slips right, and small thanks. But don't forget: the enemies don't love us any more than they love Him, and if they get topsides on Him, we're done too. But see here: when were you ordered out?'\n\n'About an hour ago, just before you saw us. A message came: Nazgul uneasy. Spies feared on Stairs. Double vigilance. Patrol to head of Stairs. I came at once.'\n\n'Bad business,' said Gorbag. 'See here \u0426 our Silent Watchers were uneasy more than two days ago, that I know. But my patrol wasn't ordered out for another day, nor any message sent to Lugburz either: owing to the Great Signal going up, and the High Nazgul going off to the war, and all that. And then they couldn't get Lugburz to pay attention for a good while, I'm told.'\n\n'The Eye was busy elsewhere, I suppose,' said Shagrat. 'Big things going on away west, they say.'\n\n'I daresay,' growled Gorbag. 'But in the meantime enemies have got up the Stairs. And what were you up to? You're supposed to keep watch, aren't you, special orders or no? What are you for?'\n\n'That's enough! Don't try and teach me my job. We were awake all right. We knew there were funny things going on.'\n\n'Very funny!'\n\n'Yes, very funny: lights and shouting and all. But Shelob was on the go. My lads saw her and her Sneak.'\n\n'Her Sneak? What's that?'\n\n'You must have seen him: little thin black fellow; like a spider himself, or perhaps more like a starved frog. He's been here before. Came out of Lugburz the first time, years ago, and we had word from High Up to let him pass. He's been up the Stairs once or twice since then, but we've left him alone: seems to have some understanding with Her Ladyship. I suppose he's no good to eat: she wouldn't worry about words from High Up. But a fine guard you keep in the valley: he was up here a day before all this racket. Early last night we saw him. Anyway my lads reported that Her Ladyship was having some fun, and that seemed good enough for me, until the message came. I thought her Sneak had brought her a toy, or that you'd perhaps sent her a present, a prisoner of war or something. I don't interfere when she's playing. Nothing gets by Shelob when she's on the hunt.'\n\n'Nothing, say you! Didn't you use your eyes back there? I tell you I'm not easy in my mind. Whatever came up the Stairs, did get by. It cut her web and got clean out of the hole. That's something to think about!'\n\n'Ah well, but she got him in the end, didn't she?'\n\n'Got him? Got who? This little fellow? But if he was the only one then she'd have had him off to her larder long before, and there he'd be now. And if Lugburz wanted him, you'd have to go and get him. Nice for you. But there was more than one.'\n\nAt this point Sam began to listen more attentively and pressed his ear against the stone.\n\n'Who cut the cords she'd put round him, Shagrat? Same one as cut the web. Didn't you see that? And who stuck a pin into Her Ladyship? Same one, I reckon. And where is he? Where is he, Shagrat?'\n\nShagrat made no reply.\n\n'You may well put your thinking cap on, if you've got one. It's no laughing matter. No one, no one has ever stuck a pin in Shelob before, as you should know well enough. There's no grief in that; but think \u0426 there's someone loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned rebel that ever walked since the bad old times, since the Great Siege. Something has slipped.'\n\n'And what is it then?' growled Shagrat.\n\n'By all the signs, Captain Shagrat, I'd say there's a large warrior loose, Elf most likely, with an elf-sword anyway, and an axe as well maybe: and he's loose in your bounds, too, and you've never spotted him. Very funny indeed!' Gorbag spat. Sam smiled grimly at this description of himself.\n\n'Ah well, you always did take a gloomy view,' said Shagrat. 'You can read the signs how you like, but there may be other ways to explain them. Anyhow. I've got watchers at every point, and I'm going to deal with one thing at a time. When I've had a look at the fellow we have caught, then I'll begin to worry about something else.'\n\n'It's my guess you won't find much in that little fellow,' said Gorbag. 'He may have had nothing to do with the real mischief. The big fellow with the sharp sword doesn't seem to have thought him worth much anyhow \u0426 just left him lying: regular elvish trick.'\n\n'We'll see. Come on now! We've talked enough. Let's go and have a look at the prisoner!\n\n'What are you going to do with him? Don't forget I spotted him first. If there's any game, me and my lads must be in it.'\n\n'Now, now,' growled Shagrat. 'I have my orders. And it's more than my belly's worth, or yours, to break 'em. Any trespasser found by the guard is to be held at the tower. Prisoner is to be stripped. Full description of every article, garment, weapon, letter, ring, or trinket is to be sent to Lugburz at once, and to Lugburz only. And the prisoner is to be kept safe and intact, under pain of death for every member of the guard, until He sends or comes Himself. That's plain enough, and that's what I'm going to do.'\n\n'Stripped, eh?' said Gorbag. 'What, teeth, nails, hair, and all?'\n\n'No, none of that. He's for Lugburz, I tell you. He's wanted safe and whole.'\n\n'You'll find that difficult,' laughed Gorbag. 'He's nothing but carrion now. What Lugburz will do with such stuff I can't guess. He might as well go in the pot.'\n\n'You fool,' snarled Shagrat. 'You've been talking very clever, but there's a lot you don't know, though most other folk do. You'll be for the pot or for Shelob, if you don't take care. Carrion! Is that all you know of Her Ladyship? When she binds with cords, she's after meat. She doesn't eat dead meat, nor suck cold blood. This fellow isn't dead!'\n\nSam reeled, clutching at the stone. He felt as if the whole dark world was turning upside down. So great was the shock that he almost swooned, but even as he fought to keep a hold on his senses, deep inside him he was aware of the comment: 'You fool, he isn't dead, and your heart knew it. Don't trust your head, Samwise, it is not the best part of you. The trouble with you is that you never really had any hope. Now what is to be done?' Fur the moment nothing, but to prop himself against the unmoving stone and listen, listen to the vile orc-voices.\n\n'Garn!' said Shagrat. 'She's got more than one poison. When she's hunting, she just gives 'em a dab in the neck and they go as limp as boned fish, and then she has her way with them. D'you remember old Ufthak? We lost him for days. Then we found him in a corner; hanging up he was, but he was wide awake and glaring. How we laughed! She'd forgotten him, maybe, but we didn't touch him \u0426 no good interfering with Her. Nar \u0426 this little filth, he'll wake up, in a few hours; and beyond feeling a bit sick for a hit, he'll be all right. Or would be, if Lugburz would let him alone. And of course, beyond wondering where he is and what's happened to him.'\n\n'And what's going to happen to him,' laughed Gorbag. 'We can tell him a few stories at any rate, if we can't do anything else. I don't suppose he's ever been in lovely Lugburz, so he may like to know what to expect. This is going to be more funny than I thought. Let's go!'\n\n'There's going to be no fun, I tell you,' said Shagrat. 'And he's got to be kept safe, or we're all as good as dead.'\n\n'All right! But if I were you, I'd catch the big one that's loose, before you send in any report to Lugburz. It won't sound too pretty to say you've caught the kitten and let the cat escape.'\n\nThe voices began to move away. Sam heard the sound of feet receding. He was recovering from his shock, and now a wild fury was on him. 'I got it all wrong!' he cried. 'I knew I would. Now they've got him, the devils! the filth! Never leave your master, never, never: that was my right rule. And I knew it in my heart. May I be forgiven! Now I've got to get back to him. Somehow, somehow!'\n\nHe drew his sword again and beat on the stone with the hilt, but it only gave out a dull sound. The sword, however, blazed so brightly now that he could see dimly in its light. To his surprise he noticed that the great block was shaped like a heavy door, and was less than twice his own height. Above it was a dark blank space between the top and the low arch of the opening. It was probably only meant to be a stop against the intrusion of Shelob, fastened on the inside with some latch or bolt beyond the reach of her cunning. With his remaining strength Sam leaped and caught the top, scrambled up, and dropped; and then he ran madly, sword blazing in hand, round a bend and up a winding tunnel.\n\nThe news that his master was still alive roused him to a last effort beyond thought of weariness. He could not see anything ahead, for this new passage twisted and turned constantly; but he thought he was catching the two Orcs up: their voices were growing nearer again. Now they seemed quite close.\n\n'That's what I'm going to do,' said Shagrat in angry tones. 'Put him right up in the top chamber.'\n\n'What for?' growled Gorbag. 'Haven't you any lock-ups down below?'\n\n'He's going out of harm's way, I tell you,' answered Shagrat. 'See? He's precious. I don't trust all my lads, and none of yours; nor you neither, when you're mad for fun. He's going where I want him, and where you won't come, if you don't keep civil. Up to the top, I say. He'll be safe there.'\n\n'Will he?' said Sam. 'You're forgetting the great big elvish warrior that's loose!' And with that he raced round the last corner, only to find that by some trick of the tunnel, or of the hearing which the Ring gave him, he had misjudged the distance.\n\nThe two orc-figures were still some way ahead. He could see them now, black and squat against a red glare. The passage ran straight at last, up an incline; and at the end, wide open, were great double doors, leading probably to deep chambers far below the high horn of the tower. Already the Orcs with their burden had passed inside. Gorbag and Shagrat were drawing near the gate.\n\nSam heard a burst of hoarse singing, blaring of horns and banging of gongs, a hideous clamour. Gorbag and Shagrat were already on the threshold.\n\nSam yelled and brandished Sting, but his little voice was drowned in the tumult. No one heeded him.\n\nThe great doors slammed to. Boom. The bars of iron fell into place inside. Clang. The gate was shut. Sam hurled himself against the bolted brazen plates and fell senseless to the ground. He was out in the darkness. Frodo was alive but taken by the Enemy.\n\nHere ends the second part of the history of the War of the Ring.\n\nThe third part tells of the last defence against the Shadow, and the end of the mission of the Ring-bearer in The Return of the King.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0443 \u0432 \u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u044d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0435 Royallib.ru: http:\/\/royallib.ru\n\n\u045c\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0442\u0437\u044b\u0432 \u043e \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0435: http:\/\/royallib.ru\/comment\/Tolkien_John\/Two_Towers.html\n\n\u00ac\u0441\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0438 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430: http:\/\/royallib.ru\/author\/Tolkien_John.html\n\n\n\nnotes\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n1\n\nSee Appendix F under Ents.\n\n\n\n2\n\nEvery month in the Shire-calendar had 30 days.\n\n","\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProduced by an anonymous Project Gutenberg volunteer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  POIROT INVESTIGATES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  BY THE SAME AUTHOR\r\n\r\n  THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES\r\n\r\n  THE SECRET ADVERSARY\r\n\r\n  THE MURDER ON THE LINKS\r\n\r\n  THE BODLEY HEAD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  POIROT INVESTIGATES\r\n\r\n  BY AGATHA CHRISTIE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  LONDON\r\n\r\n  JOHN LANE THE BODLEY HEAD LIMITED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  First published in Great Britain by\r\n  John Lane Company, The Bodley Head Limited, 1924\r\n\r\n  Copyright \u00a9 1924 Agatha Christie Limited\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  I The Adventure of \u201cThe Western Star\u201d\r\n\r\n  II The Tragedy at Marsdon Manor\r\n\r\n  III The Adventure of the Cheap Flat\r\n\r\n  IV The Mystery of Hunter\u2019s Lodge\r\n\r\n  V The Million Dollar Bond Robbery\r\n\r\n  VI The Adventure of the Egyptian Tomb\r\n\r\n  VII Jewel Robbery at the _Grand Metropolitan_\r\n\r\n  VIII The Kidnapped Prime Minister\r\n\r\n  IX The Disappearance of Mr. Davenheim\r\n\r\n  X The Adventure of the Italian Nobleman\r\n\r\n  XI The Case of the Missing Will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  POIROT INVESTIGATES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  POIROT INVESTIGATES\r\n\r\n\r\n  I\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Adventure of \u201cThe Western Star\u201d\r\n\r\nI was standing at the window of Poirot\u2019s rooms looking out idly on\r\nthe street below.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s queer,\u201d I ejaculated suddenly beneath my breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is, _mon ami_?\u201d asked Poirot placidly, from the depths of\r\nhis comfortable chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cDeduce, Poirot, from the following facts! Here is a young lady,\r\nrichly dressed\u2014fashionable hat, magnificent furs. She is coming\r\nalong slowly, looking up at the houses as she goes. Unknown to her,\r\nshe is being shadowed by three men and a middle-aged woman. They\r\nhave just been joined by an errand boy who points after the girl,\r\ngesticulating as he does so. What drama is this being played? Is\r\nthe girl a crook, and are the shadowers detectives preparing to\r\narrest her? Or are _they_ the scoundrels, and are they plotting to\r\nattack an innocent victim? What does the great detective say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe great detective, _mon ami_, chooses, as ever, the simplest\r\ncourse. He rises to see for himself.\u201d And my friend joined me at\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\nIn a minute he gave vent to an amused chuckle.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs usual, your facts are tinged with your incurable romanticism.\r\nThat is Miss Mary Marvell, the film star. She is being followed by\r\na bevy of admirers who have recognized her. And, _en passant_, my\r\ndear Hastings, she is quite aware of the fact!\u201d\r\n\r\nI laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo all is explained! But you get no marks for that, Poirot. It\r\nwas a mere matter of recognition.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_En v\u00e9rit\u00e9!_ And how many times have you seen Mary Marvell on the\r\nscreen, _mon cher_?\u201d\r\n\r\nI thought.\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout a dozen times perhaps.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2014once! Yet _I_ recognize her, and _you_ do not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe looks so different,\u201d I replied rather feebly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! _Sacr\u00e9_!\u201d cried Poirot. \u201cIs it that you expect her to promenade\r\nherself in the streets of London in a cowboy hat, or with bare\r\nfeet, and a bunch of curls, as an Irish colleen? Always with you\r\nit is the non-essentials! Remember the case of the dancer, Valerie\r\nSaintclair.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders, slightly annoyed.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut console yourself, _mon ami_,\u201d said Poirot, calming down. \u201cAll\r\ncannot be as Hercule Poirot! I know it well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou really have the best opinion of yourself of anyone I ever\r\nknew!\u201d I cried, divided between amusement and annoyance.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat will you? When one is unique, one knows it! And others share\r\nthat opinion\u2014even, if I mistake not, Miss Mary Marvell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout doubt. She is coming here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you make that out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery simply. This street, it is not aristocratic, _mon ami_! In\r\nit there is no fashionable doctor, no fashionable dentist\u2014still\r\nless is there a fashionable milliner! But there _is_ a fashionable\r\ndetective. _Oui_, my friend, it is true\u2014I am become the mode, the\r\n_dernier cri_! One says to another: \u2018_Comment?_ You have lost your\r\ngold pencil-case? You must go to the little Belgian. He is too\r\nmarvellous! Every one goes! _Courez!\u2019_ And they arrive! In flocks,\r\n_mon ami_! With problems of the most foolish!\u201d A bell rang below.\r\n\u201cWhat did I tell you? That is Miss Marvell.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs usual, Poirot was right. After a short interval, the American\r\nfilm star was ushered in, and we rose to our feet.\r\n\r\nMary Marvell was undoubtedly one of the most popular actresses on\r\nthe screen. She had only lately arrived in England in company with\r\nher husband, Gregory B. Rolf, also a film actor. Their marriage\r\nhad taken place about a year ago in the States and this was their\r\nfirst visit to England. They had been given a great reception.\r\nEvery one was prepared to go mad over Mary Marvell, her wonderful\r\nclothes, her furs, her jewels, above all one jewel, the great\r\ndiamond which had been nicknamed, to match its owner, \u201cthe Western\r\nStar.\u201d Much, true and untrue, had been written about this famous\r\nstone which was reported to be insured for the enormous sum of\r\nfifty thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nAll these details passed rapidly through my mind as I joined with\r\nPoirot in greeting our fair client.\r\n\r\nMiss Marvell was small and slender, very fair and girlish-looking,\r\nwith the wide innocent blue eyes of a child.\r\n\r\nPoirot drew forward a chair for her, and she commenced talking at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will probably think me very foolish, Monsieur Poirot, but Lord\r\nCronshaw was telling me last night how wonderfully you cleared up\r\nthe mystery of his nephew\u2019s death, and I felt that I just must have\r\nyour advice. I dare say it\u2019s only a silly hoax\u2014Gregory says so\u2014but\r\nit\u2019s just worrying me to death.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe paused for breath. Poirot beamed encouragement.\r\n\r\n\u201cProceed, Madame. You comprehend, I am still in the dark.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s these letters.\u201d Miss Marvell unclasped her handbag, and drew\r\nout three envelopes which she handed to Poirot.\r\n\r\nThe latter scrutinized them closely.\r\n\r\n\u201cCheap paper\u2014the name and address carefully printed. Let us see\r\nthe inside.\u201d He drew out the enclosure.\r\n\r\nI had joined him, and was leaning over his shoulder. The writing\r\nconsisted of a single sentence, carefully printed like the envelope.\r\nIt ran as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe great diamond which is the left eye of the god must return\r\nwhence it came.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe second letter was couched in precisely the same terms, but the\r\nthird was more explicit:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have been warned. You have not obeyed. Now the diamond will\r\nbe taken from you. At the full of the moon, the two diamonds which\r\nare the left and right eye of the god shall return. So it is\r\nwritten.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first letter I treated as a joke,\u201d explained Miss Marvell.\r\n\u201cWhen I got the second, I began to wonder. The third one came\r\nyesterday, and it seemed to me that, after all, the matter might\r\nbe more serious than I had imagined.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see they did not come by post, these letters.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; they were left by hand\u2014by a _Chinaman._ That is what frightens\r\nme.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause it was from a Chink in San Francisco that Gregory bought\r\nthe stone three years ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see, madame, that you believe the diamond referred to to be\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The Western Star,\u2019\u201d finished Miss Marvell. \u201cThat\u2019s so. At the\r\ntime, Gregory remembers that there was some story attached to the\r\nstone, but the Chink wasn\u2019t handing out any information. Gregory\r\nsays he seemed just scared to death, and in a mortal hurry to get\r\nrid of the thing. He only asked about a tenth of its value. It was\r\nGreg\u2019s wedding present to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe story seems of an almost unbelievable romanticism. And yet\u2014who\r\nknows? I pray of you, Hastings, hand me my little almanac.\u201d\r\n\r\nI complied.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Voyons!_\u201d said Poirot, turning the leaves.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen is the date of the full moon? Ah, Friday next. That is in\r\nthree days\u2019 time. _Eh bien_, madame, you seek my advice\u2014I give it\r\nto you. This _belle histoire_ may be a hoax\u2014but it may not!\r\nTherefore I counsel you to place the diamond in my keeping until\r\nafter Friday next. Then we can take what steps we please.\u201d\r\n\r\nA slight cloud passed over the actress\u2019s face, and she replied\r\nconstrainedly:\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s impossible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have it with you\u2014_hein_?\u201d Poirot was watching her narrowly.\r\n\r\nThe girl hesitated a moment, then slipped her hand into the bosom\r\nof her gown, drawing out a long thin chain. She leaned forward,\r\nunclosing her hand. In the palm, a stone of white fire, exquisitely\r\nset in platinum, lay and winked at us solemnly.\r\n\r\nPoirot drew in his breath with a long hiss.\r\n\r\n\u201c_\u00c9patant!_\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou permit, madame?\u201d He took the jewel\r\nin his own hand and scrutinized it keenly, then restored it to her\r\nwith a little bow. \u201cA magnificent stone\u2014without a flaw. Ah, _cent\r\ntonnerres!_ and you carry it about with you, _comme \u00e7a_!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m very careful really, Monsieur Poirot. As a rule it\u2019s\r\nlocked up in my jewel-case, and left in the hotel safe deposit.\r\nWe\u2019re staying at the _Magnificent_, you know. I just brought it\r\nalong to-day for you to see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you will leave it with me, _n\u2019est-ce pas_? You will be advised\r\nby Papa Poirot?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you see, it\u2019s this way, Monsieur Poirot. On Friday we\u2019re\r\ngoing down to Yardly Chase to spend a few days with Lord and Lady\r\nYardly.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer words awoke a vague echo of remembrance in my mind. Some\r\ngossip\u2014what was it now? A few years ago Lord and Lady Yardly had\r\npaid a visit to the States, rumour had it that his lordship had\r\nrather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady\r\nfriends\u2014but surely there was something more, some gossip which\r\ncoupled Lady Yardly\u2019s name with that of a \u201cmovie\u201d star in\r\nCalifornia\u2014why! it came to me in a flash\u2014of course it was none\r\nother than Gregory B. Rolf.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you into a little secret, Monsieur Poirot,\u201d Miss Marvell\r\nwas continuing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a deal on with Lord Yardly. There\u2019s some\r\nchance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral\r\npile.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt Yardly Chase?\u201d I cried, interested. \u201cWhy, it\u2019s one of the show\r\nplaces of England.\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Marvell nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s the real old feudal stuff all right. But he wants a\r\npretty stiff price, and of course I don\u2019t know yet whether the deal\r\nwill go through, but Greg and I always like to combine business\r\nwith pleasure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut\u2014I demand pardon if I am dense, madame\u2014surely it is possible\r\nto visit Yardly Chase without taking the diamond with you?\u201d\r\n\r\nA shrewd, hard look came into Miss Marvell\u2019s eyes which belied\r\ntheir childlike appearance. She looked suddenly a good deal older.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to wear it down there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely\u201d I said suddenly, \u201cthere are some very famous jewels in\r\nthe Yardly collection, a large diamond amongst them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d said Miss Marvell briefly.\r\n\r\nI heard Poirot murmur beneath his breath: \u201cAh, _c\u2019est comme \u00e7a_!\u201d\r\nThen he said aloud, with his usual uncanny luck in hitting the\r\nbull\u2019s-eye (he dignifies it by the name of psychology): \u201cThen you\r\nare without doubt already acquainted with Lady Yardly, or perhaps\r\nyour husband is?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGregory knew her when she was out West three years ago,\u201d said Miss\r\nMarvell. She hesitated a moment, and then added abruptly: \u201cDo\r\neither of you ever see _Society Gossip_?\u201d\r\n\r\nWe both pleaded guilty rather shamefacedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI ask because in this week\u2019s number there is an article on famous\r\njewels, and it\u2019s really very curious\u2014\u2014\u201d She broke off.\r\n\r\nI rose, went to the table at the other side of the room and returned\r\nwith the paper in question in my hand. She took it from me, found\r\nthe article, and began to read aloud:\r\n\r\n\u201c. . . Amongst other famous stones may be included the Star of the\r\nEast, a diamond in the possession of the Yardly family. An ancestor\r\nof the present Lord Yardly brought it back with him from China,\r\nand a romantic story is said to attach to it. According to this,\r\nthe stone was once the right eye of a temple god. Another diamond,\r\nexactly similar in form and size, formed the left eye, and the\r\nstory goes that this jewel, too, would in course of time be stolen.\r\n\u2018One eye shall go West, the other East, till they shall meet once\r\nmore. Then, in triumph shall they return to the god.\u2019 It is a\r\ncurious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone\r\ncorresponding closely in description with this one, and known as\r\n\u2018the Star of the West,\u2019 or \u2018the Western Star.\u2019 It is the property\r\nof the celebrated film actress, Miss Mary Marvell. A comparison of\r\nthe two stones would be interesting.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stopped.\r\n\r\n\u201c_\u00c9patant!_\u201d murmured Poirot. \u201cWithout doubt a romance of the first\r\nwater.\u201d He turned to Mary Marvell. \u201cAnd you are not afraid, madame?\r\nYou have no superstitious terrors? You do not fear to introduce\r\nthese two Siamese twins to each other lest a Chinaman should appear\r\nand, hey presto! whisk them both back to China?\u201d\r\n\r\nHis tone was mocking, but I fancied that an undercurrent of\r\nseriousness lay beneath it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that Lady Yardly\u2019s diamond is anything like as\r\ngood a stone as mine,\u201d said Miss Marvell. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m going to\r\nsee.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat more Poirot would have said I do not know, for at that moment\r\nthe door flew open, and a splendid-looking man strode into the\r\nroom. From his crisply curling black head, to the tips of his\r\npatent-leather boots, he was a hero fit for romance.\r\n\r\n\u201cI said I\u2019d call round for you, Mary,\u201d said Gregory Rolf, \u201cand here\r\nI am. Well, what does Monsieur Poirot say to our little problem?\r\nJust one big hoax, same as I do?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled up at the big actor. They made a ridiculous contrast.\r\n\r\n\u201cHoax or no hoax, Mr. Rolf,\u201d he said dryly, \u201cI have advised Madame\r\nyour wife not to take the jewel with her to Yardly Chase on Friday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m with you there, sir. I\u2019ve already said so to Mary. But there!\r\nShe\u2019s a woman through and through, and I guess she can\u2019t bear to\r\nthink of another woman outshining her in the jewel line.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat nonsense, Gregory!\u201d said Mary Marvell sharply. But she\r\nflushed angrily.\r\n\r\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame, I have advised. I can do no more. _C\u2019est fini_.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe bowed them both to the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! _la la_,\u201d he observed, returning. \u201c_Histoire de femmes!_ The\r\ngood husband, he hit the nail on the head\u2014_tout de m\u00eame_, he was\r\nnot tactful! Assuredly not.\u201d\r\n\r\nI imparted to him my vague remembrances, and he nodded vigorously.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo I thought. All the same, there is something curious underneath\r\nall this. With your permission, _mon ami_, I will take the air.\r\nAwait my return, I beg of you. I shall not be long.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door,\r\nand put her head in.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s another lady to see Mr. Poirot, sir. I\u2019ve told her he was\r\nout, but she says as how she\u2019ll wait, seeing as she\u2019s come up from\r\nthe country.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, show her in here, Mrs. Murchison. Perhaps I can do something\r\nfor her.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn another moment the lady had been ushered in. My heart gave a\r\nleap as I recognized her. Lady Yardly\u2019s portrait had figured too\r\noften in the Society papers to allow her to remain unknown.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo sit down, Lady Yardly,\u201d I said, drawing forward a chair. \u201cMy\r\nfriend Poirot is out, but I know for a fact that he\u2019ll be back very\r\nshortly.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe thanked me and sat down. A very different type, this, from Miss\r\nMary Marvell. Tall, dark, with flashing eyes, and a pale proud\r\nface\u2014yet something wistful in the curves of the mouth.\r\n\r\nI felt a desire to rise to the occasion. Why not? In Poirot\u2019s\r\npresence I have frequently felt a difficulty\u2014I do not appear at my\r\nbest. And yet there is no doubt that I, too, possess the deductive\r\nsense in a marked degree. I leant forward on a sudden impulse.\r\n\r\n\u201cLady Yardly,\u201d I said, \u201cI know why you have come here. You have\r\nreceived blackmailing letters about the diamond.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home. She stared at\r\nme open-mouthed, all colour banished from her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know?\u201d she gasped. \u201cHow?\u201d\r\n\r\nI smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy a perfectly logical process. If Miss Marvell has had warning\r\nletters\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMiss Marvell? She has been here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe has just left. As I was saying, if she, as the holder of one\r\nof the twin diamonds, has received a mysterious series of warnings,\r\nyou, as the holder of the other stone, must necessarily have done\r\nthe same. You see how simple it is? I am right, then, you have\r\nreceived these strange communications also?\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment she hesitated, as though in doubt whether to trust me\r\nor not, then she bowed her head in assent with a little smile.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is so,\u201d she acknowledged.\r\n\r\n\u201cWere yours, too, left by hand\u2014by a Chinaman?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, they came by post; but, tell me, has Miss Marvell undergone\r\nthe same experience, then?\u201d\r\n\r\nI recounted to her the events of the morning. She listened\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt all fits in. My letters are the duplicates of hers. It is true\r\nthat they came by post, but there is a curious perfume impregnating\r\nthem\u2014something in the nature of joss-stick\u2014that at once suggested\r\nthe East to me. What does it all mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is what we must find out. You have the letters with you? We\r\nmight learn something from the postmarks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUnfortunately I destroyed them. You understand, at the time I\r\nregarded it as some foolish joke. Can it be true that some Chinese\r\ngang are really trying to recover the diamonds? It seems too\r\nincredible.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe went over the facts again and again, but could get no further\r\ntowards the elucidation of the mystery. At last Lady Yardly rose.\r\n\r\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think I need wait for Monsieur Poirot. You can tell\r\nhim all this, can\u2019t you? Thank you so much, Mr.\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, her hand outstretched.\r\n\r\n\u201cCaptain Hastings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me. You\u2019re a friend of the Cavendishes,\r\naren\u2019t you? It was Mary Cavendish who sent me to Monsieur Poirot.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen my friend returned, I enjoyed telling him the tale of what\r\nhad occurred during his absence. He cross-questioned me rather\r\nsharply over the details of our conversation and I could read\r\nbetween the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent.\r\nI also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined\r\nto be jealous. It had become rather a pose with him to consistently\r\nbelittle my abilities, and I think he was chagrined at finding no\r\nloophole for criticism. I was secretly rather pleased with myself,\r\nthough I tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him. In\r\nspite of his idiosyncrasies, I was deeply attached to my quaint\r\nlittle friend.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Bien!_\u201d he said at length, with a curious look on his face. \u201cThe\r\nplot develops. Pass me, I pray you, that \u2018Peerage\u2019 on the top shelf\r\nthere.\u201d He turned the leaves. \u201cAh, here we are! \u2018Yardly . . . 10th\r\nviscount, served South African War\u2019 . . . _tout \u00e7a n\u2019a pas\r\nd\u2019importance_ . . . \u2018mar. 1907 Hon. Maude Stopperton, fourth\r\ndaughter of 3rd Baron Cotteril\u2019 . . . um, um, um, . . . \u2018has iss.\r\ntwo daughters, born 1908, 1910. . . . Clubs . . . residences.\u2019 . . .\r\n_Voil\u00e0_, that does not tell us much. But to-morrow morning we see\r\nthis _milord_!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I telegraphed to him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you had washed your hands of the case?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not acting for Miss Marvell since she refuses to be guided\r\nby my advice. What I do now is for my own satisfaction\u2014the\r\nsatisfaction of Hercule Poirot! Decidedly, I must have a finger in\r\nthis pie.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you calmly wire Lord Yardly to dash up to town just to suit\r\nyour convenience. He won\u2019t be pleased.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Au contraire_, if I preserve for him his family diamond, he ought\r\nto be very grateful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you really think there is a chance of it being stolen?\u201d I\r\nasked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlmost a certainty,\u201d replied Poirot placidly. \u201cEverything points\r\nthat way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot stopped my eager questions with an airy gesture of the hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot now, I pray you. Let us not confuse the mind. And observe that\r\n\u2018Peerage\u2019\u2014how you have replaced him! See you not that the tallest\r\nbooks go in the top shelf, the next tallest in the row beneath,\r\nand so on. Thus we have order, _method_, which, as I have often\r\ntold you, Hastings\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d I said hastily, and put the offending volume in its\r\nproper place.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Yardly turned out to be a cheery, loud-voiced sportsman with\r\na rather red face, but with a good-humoured bonhomie about him that\r\nwas distinctly attractive and made up for any lack of mentality.\r\n\r\n\u201cExtraordinary business this, Monsieur Poirot. Can\u2019t make head or\r\ntail of it. Seems my wife\u2019s been getting odd kind of letters, and\r\nthat this Miss Marvell\u2019s had \u2019em too. What does it all mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot handed him the copy of _Society Gossip_.\r\n\r\n\u201cFirst, _milord_, I would ask you if these facts are substantially\r\ncorrect?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe peer took it. His face darkened with anger as he read.\r\n\r\n\u201cDamned nonsense!\u201d he spluttered. \u201cThere\u2019s never been any romantic\r\nstory attaching to the diamond. It came from India originally, I\r\nbelieve. I never heard of all this Chinese god stuff.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStill, the stone _is_ known as \u2018The Star of the East.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what if it is?\u201d he demanded wrathfully.\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled a little, but made no direct reply. \u201cWhat I would\r\nask you to do, _milord_, is to place yourself in my hands. If you\r\ndo so unreservedly, I have great hopes of averting the catastrophe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you think there\u2019s actually something in these wild-cat\r\ntales?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you do as I ask you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I will, but\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Bien!_ Then permit that I ask you a few questions. This affair\r\nof Yardly Chase, is it, as you say, all fixed up between you and\r\nMr. Rolf?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, he told you about it, did he? No, there\u2019s nothing settled.\u201d\r\nHe hesitated, the brick-red colour of his face deepening. \u201cMight\r\nas well get the thing straight. I\u2019ve made rather an ass of myself\r\nin many ways, Monsieur Poirot\u2014and I\u2019m head over ears in debt\u2014but\r\nI want to pull up. I\u2019m fond of the kids, and I want to straighten\r\nthings up, and be able to live on at the old place. Gregory Rolf\r\nis offering me big money\u2014enough to set me on my feet again. I don\u2019t\r\nwant to do it\u2014I hate the thought of all that crowd play-acting\r\nround the Chase\u2014but I may have to, unless\u2014\u2014\u201d He broke off.\r\n\r\nPoirot eyed him keenly. \u201cYou have, then, another string to your\r\nbow? Permit that I make a guess? It is to sell the Star of the\r\nEast?\u201d\r\n\r\nLord Yardly nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s it. It\u2019s been in the family for some\r\ngenerations, but it\u2019s not entailed. Still, it\u2019s not the easiest\r\nthing in the world to find a purchaser. Hoffberg, the Hatton Garden\r\nman, is on the look-out for a likely customer, but he\u2019ll have to\r\nfind one soon, or it\u2019s a washout.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne more question, _permettez_\u2014Lady Yardly, which plan does she\r\napprove?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, she\u2019s bitterly opposed to my selling the jewel. You know what\r\nwomen are. She\u2019s all for this film stunt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI comprehend,\u201d said Poirot. He remained a moment or so in thought,\r\nthen rose briskly to his feet. \u201cYou return to Yardly Chase at once?\r\n_Bien!_ Say no word to anyone\u2014to _anyone_ mind\u2014but expect us there\r\nthis evening. We will arrive shortly after five.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, but I don\u2019t see\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_\u00c7a n\u2019a pas d\u2019importance_,\u201d said Poirot kindly. \u201cYou will that I\r\npreserve for you your diamond, _n\u2019est-ce pas_?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen do as I say.\u201d\r\n\r\nA sadly bewildered nobleman left the room.\r\n\r\n  \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022\r\n\r\nIt was half-past five when we arrived at Yardly Chase, and followed\r\nthe dignified butler to the old panelled hall with its fire of\r\nblazing logs. A pretty picture met our eyes: Lady Yardly and her\r\ntwo children, the mother\u2019s proud dark head bent down over the two\r\nfair ones. Lord Yardly stood near, smiling down on them.\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings,\u201d announced the butler.\r\n\r\nLady Yardly looked up with a start, her husband came forward\r\nuncertainly, his eyes seeking instruction from Poirot. The little\r\nman was equal to the occasion.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll my excuses! It is that I investigate still this affair of Miss\r\nMarvell\u2019s. She comes to you on Friday, does she not? I make a\r\nlittle tour first to make sure that all is secure. Also I wanted\r\nto ask of Lady Yardly if she recollected at all the postmarks on\r\nthe letters she received?\u201d\r\n\r\nLady Yardly shook her head regretfully. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t. It is\r\nstupid of me. But, you see, I never dreamt of taking them\r\nseriously.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll stay the night?\u201d said Lord Yardly.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, _milord_, I fear to incommode you. We have left our bags at\r\nthe inn.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d Lord Yardly had his cue. \u201cWe\u2019ll send down for\r\nthem. No, no\u2014no trouble, I assure you.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot permitted himself to be persuaded, and sitting down by Lady\r\nYardly, began to make friends with the children. In a short time\r\nthey were all romping together, and had dragged me into the game.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Vous \u00eates bonne m\u00e8re_,\u201d said Poirot, with a gallant little bow,\r\nas the children were removed reluctantly by a stern nurse.\r\n\r\nLady Yardly smoothed her ruffled hair.\r\n\r\n\u201cI adore them,\u201d she said with a little catch in her voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd they you\u2014with reason!\u201d Poirot bowed again.\r\n\r\nA dressing-gong sounded, and we rose to go up to our rooms. At that\r\nmoment the butler entered with a telegram on a salver which he\r\nhanded to Lord Yardly. The latter tore it open with a brief word\r\nof apology. As he read it he stiffened visibly.\r\n\r\nWith an ejaculation, he handed it to his wife. Then he glanced at\r\nmy friend.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust a minute, Monsieur Poirot. I feel you ought to know about\r\nthis. It\u2019s from Hoffberg. He thinks he\u2019s found a customer for the\r\ndiamond\u2014an American, sailing for the States to-morrow. They\u2019re\r\nsending down a chap to-night to vet the stone. By Jove, though, if\r\nthis goes through\u2014\u2014\u201d Words failed him.\r\n\r\nLady Yardly had turned away. She still held the telegram in her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t sell it, George,\u201d she said, in a low voice.\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been in the family so long.\u201d She waited, as though for a\r\nreply, but when none came her face hardened. She shrugged her\r\nshoulders. \u201cI must go and dress. I suppose I had better display\r\n\u2018the goods.\u2019\u201d She turned to Poirot with a slight grimace. \u201cIt\u2019s\r\none of the most hideous necklaces that was ever designed! George\r\nhas always promised to have the stones reset for me, but it\u2019s never\r\nbeen done.\u201d She left the room.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, we three were assembled in the great drawing-room\r\nawaiting the lady. It was already a few minutes past the dinner\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a low rustle, and Lady Yardly appeared framed\r\nin the doorway, a radiant figure in a long white shimmering dress.\r\nRound the column of her neck was a rivulet of fire. She stood there\r\nwith one hand just touching the necklace.\r\n\r\n\u201cBehold the sacrifice,\u201d she said gaily. Her ill-humour seemed to\r\nhave vanished. \u201cWait while I turn the big light on and you shall\r\nfeast your eyes on the ugliest necklace in England.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe switches were just outside the door. As she stretched out her\r\nhand to them, the incredible thing happened. Suddenly without any\r\nwarning, every light was extinguished, the door banged, and from\r\nthe other side of it came a long-drawn piercing woman\u2019s scream.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God!\u201d cried Lord Yardly. \u201cThat was Maude\u2019s voice! What has\r\nhappened?\u201d\r\n\r\nWe rushed blindly for the door, cannoning into each other in the\r\ndarkness. It was some minutes before we could find it. What a sight\r\nmet our eyes! Lady Yardly lay senseless on the marble floor, a\r\ncrimson mark on her white throat where the necklace had been\r\nwrenched from her neck.\r\n\r\nAs we bent over her, uncertain for the moment whether she were dead\r\nor alive, her eyelids opened.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Chinaman,\u201d she whispered painfully. \u201cThe Chinaman\u2014the side\r\ndoor.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord Yardly sprang up with an oath. I accompanied him, my heart\r\nbeating wildly. The Chinaman again! The side door in question was\r\na small one in the angle of the wall, not more than a dozen yards\r\nfrom the scene of the tragedy. As we reached it, I gave a cry.\r\nThere, just short of the threshold, lay the glittering necklace,\r\nevidently dropped by the thief in the panic of his flight. I\r\nswooped joyously down on it. Then I uttered another cry which Lord\r\nYardly echoed. For in the middle of the necklace was a great gap.\r\nThe Star of the East was missing!\r\n\r\n\u201cThat settles it,\u201d I breathed. \u201cThese were no ordinary thieves.\r\nThis one stone was all they wanted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut how did the fellow get in?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThrough this door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s always locked.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s not locked now. See.\u201d I pulled it open as\r\nI spoke.\r\n\r\nAs I did so something fluttered to the ground. I picked it up. It\r\nwas a piece of silk, and the embroidery was unmistakable. It had\r\nbeen torn from a Chinaman\u2019s robe.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn his haste it caught in the door,\u201d I explained. \u201cCome, hurry.\r\nHe cannot have gone far as yet.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut in vain we hunted and searched. In the pitch darkness of the\r\nnight, the thief had found it easy to make his getaway. We returned\r\nreluctantly, and Lord Yardly sent off one of the footmen post-haste\r\nto fetch the police.\r\n\r\nLady Yardly, aptly ministered to by Poirot, who is as good as a\r\nwoman in these matters, was sufficiently recovered to be able to\r\ntell her story.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was just going to turn on the other light,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen a\r\nman sprang on me from behind. He tore my necklace from my neck with\r\nsuch force that I fell headlong to the floor. As I fell I saw him\r\ndisappearing through the side door. Then I realized by the pig-tail\r\nand the embroidered robe that he was a Chinaman.\u201d She stopped with\r\na shudder.\r\n\r\nThe butler reappeared. He spoke in a low voice to Lord Yardly.\r\n\r\n\u201cA gentleman from Mr. Hoffberg\u2019s, m\u2019lord. He says you expect him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d cried the distracted nobleman. \u201cI must see him, I\r\nsuppose. No, not here, Mullings, in the library.\u201d\r\n\r\nI drew Poirot aside.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here, my dear fellow, hadn\u2019t we better get back to London?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think so, Hastings? Why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell\u201d\u2014I coughed delicately\u2014\u201cthings haven\u2019t gone very well, have\r\nthey? I mean, you tell Lord Yardly to place himself in your hands\r\nand all will be well\u2014and then the diamond vanishes from under your\r\nvery nose!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d said Poirot, rather crestfallen. \u201cIt was not one of my most\r\nstriking triumphs.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis way of describing events almost caused me to smile, but I\r\nstuck to my guns.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo, having\u2014pardon the expression\u2014rather made a mess of things,\r\ndon\u2019t you think it would be more graceful to leave immediately?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the dinner, the without doubt excellent dinner, that the\r\n_chef_ of Lord Yardly has prepared?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, what\u2019s dinner!\u201d I said impatiently.\r\n\r\nPoirot held up his hands in horror.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon Dieu!_ It is that in this country you treat the affairs\r\ngastronomic with a criminal indifference.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s another reason why we should get back to London as soon\r\nas possible,\u201d I continued.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that, my friend?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe other diamond,\u201d I said, lowering my voice. \u201cMiss Marvell\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien_, what of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d His unusual obtuseness annoyed me. What had\r\nhappened to his usually keen wits? \u201cThey\u2019ve got one, now they\u2019ll\r\ngo for the other.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Tiens!_\u201d cried Poirot, stepping back a pace and regarding me with\r\nadmiration. \u201cBut your brain marches to a marvel, my friend! Figure\r\nto yourself that for the moment I had not thought of that! But\r\nthere is plenty of time. The full of the moon, it is not until\r\nFriday.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head dubiously. The full of the moon theory left me\r\nentirely cold. I had my way with Poirot, however, and we departed\r\nimmediately, leaving behind us a note of explanation and apology\r\nfor Lord Yardly.\r\n\r\nMy idea was to go at once to the _Magnificent_, and relate to Miss\r\nMarvell what had occurred, but Poirot vetoed the plan, and insisted\r\nthat the morning would be time enough. I gave in rather grudgingly.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Poirot seemed strangely disinclined to stir out. I\r\nbegan to suspect that, having made a mistake to start with, he was\r\nsingularly loath to proceed with the case. In answer to my\r\npersuasions, he pointed out, with admirable common sense, that as\r\nthe details of the affair at Yardly Chase were already in the\r\nmorning papers the Rolfs would know quite as much as we could tell\r\nthem. I gave way unwillingly.\r\n\r\nEvents proved my forebodings to be justified. About two o\u2019clock,\r\nthe telephone rang. Poirot answered it. He listened for some\r\nmoments, then with a brief \u201c_Bien, j\u2019y serai_\u201d he rang off, and\r\nturned to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think, _mon ami_?\u201d He looked half ashamed, half\r\nexcited. \u201cThe diamond of Miss Marvell, it has been stolen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I cried, springing up. \u201cAnd what about the \u2018full of the\r\nmoon\u2019 now?\u201d Poirot hung his head. \u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis morning, I understand.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head sadly. \u201cIf only you had listened to me. You see I\r\nwas right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt appears so, _mon ami_,\u201d said Poirot cautiously. \u201cAppearances\r\nare deceptive, they say, but it certainly appears so.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs we hurried in a taxi to the _Magnificent_, I puzzled out the\r\ntrue inwardness of the scheme.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat \u2018full of the moon\u2019 idea was clever. The whole point of it\r\nwas to get us to concentrate on the Friday, and so be off our guard\r\nbeforehand. It is a pity you did not realize that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Ma foi!_\u201d said Poirot airily, his nonchalance quite restored\r\nafter its brief eclipse. \u201cOne cannot think of everything!\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt sorry for him. He did so hate failure of any kind.\r\n\r\n\u201cCheer up,\u201d I said consolingly. \u201cBetter luck next time.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the _Magnificent_, we were ushered at once into the manager\u2019s\r\noffice. Gregory Rolf was there with two men from Scotland Yard. A\r\npale-faced clerk sat opposite them.\r\n\r\nRolf nodded to us as we entered.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting to the bottom of it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s almost\r\nunbelievable. How the guy had the nerve I can\u2019t think.\u201d\r\n\r\nA very few minutes sufficed to give us the facts. Mr. Rolf had gone\r\nout of the hotel at 11.15. At 11.30, a gentleman, so like him in\r\nappearance as to pass muster, entered the hotel and demanded the\r\njewel-case from the safe deposit. He duly signed the receipt,\r\nremarking carelessly as he did so: \u201cLooks a bit different from my\r\nordinary one, but I hurt my hand getting out of the taxi.\u201d The\r\nclerk merely smiled and remarked that he saw very little difference.\r\nRolf laughed and said: \u201cWell, don\u2019t run me in as a crook this time,\r\nanyway. I\u2019ve been getting threatening letters from a Chinaman, and\r\nthe worst of it is I look rather like a Chink myself\u2014it\u2019s something\r\nabout the eyes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI looked at him,\u201d said the clerk who was telling us this, \u201cand I\r\nsaw at once what he meant. The eyes slanted up at the corners like\r\nan Oriental\u2019s. I\u2019d never noticed it before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDarn it all, man,\u201d roared Gregory Rolf, leaning forward, \u201cdo you\r\nnotice it now?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man looked up at him and started.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t say I do.\u201d And indeed there was\r\nnothing even remotely Oriental about the frank brown eyes that\r\nlooked into ours.\r\n\r\nThe Scotland Yard man grunted. \u201cBold customer. Thought the eyes\r\nmight be noticed, and took the bull by the horns to disarm\r\nsuspicion. He must have watched you out of the hotel, sir, and\r\nnipped in as soon as you were well away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about the jewel-case?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was found in a corridor of the hotel. Only one thing had been\r\ntaken\u2014\u2018the Western Star.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nWe stared at each other\u2014the whole thing was so bizarre, so unreal.\r\n\r\nPoirot hopped briskly to his feet. \u201cI have not been of much use,\r\nI fear,\u201d he said regretfully. \u201cIs it permitted to see Madame?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess she\u2019s prostrated with the shock,\u201d explained Rolf.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen perhaps I might have a few words alone with you, monsieur?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn about five minutes Poirot reappeared.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, my friend,\u201d he said gaily. \u201cTo a post office. I have to send\r\na telegram.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho to?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLord Yardly.\u201d He discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm\r\nthrough mine. \u201cCome, come, _mon ami_. I know all that you feel\r\nabout this miserable business. I have not distinguished myself!\r\nYou, in my place, might have distinguished yourself! _Bien!_ All\r\nis admitted. Let us forget it and have lunch.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was about four o\u2019clock when we entered Poirot\u2019s rooms. A figure\r\nrose from a chair by the window. It was Lord Yardly. He looked\r\nhaggard and distraught.\r\n\r\n\u201cI got your wire and came up at once. Look here, I\u2019ve been round\r\nto Hoffberg, and they know nothing about that man of theirs last\r\nnight, or the wire either. Do you think that\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot held up his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy excuses! I sent that wire, and hired the gentleman in question.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_You_\u2014but why? What?\u201d The nobleman spluttered impotently.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy little idea was to bring things to a head,\u201d explained Poirot\r\nplacidly.\r\n\r\n\u201cBring things to a head! Oh, my God!\u201d cried Lord Yardly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the ruse succeeded,\u201d said Poirot cheerfully. \u201cTherefore,\r\n_milord_, I have much pleasure in returning you\u2014this!\u201d With a\r\ndramatic gesture he produced a glittering object. It was a great\r\ndiamond.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Star of the East,\u201d gasped Lord Yardly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t\r\nunderstand\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo?\u201d said Poirot. \u201cIt makes no matter. Believe me, it was necessary\r\nfor the diamond to be stolen. I promised you that it should be\r\npreserved to you, and I have kept my word. You must permit me to\r\nkeep my little secret. Convey, I beg of you, the assurances of my\r\ndeepest respect to Lady Yardly, and tell her how pleased I am to\r\nbe able to restore her jewel to her. What _beau temps_, is it not?\r\nGood day, _milord_.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd smiling and talking, the amazing little man conducted the\r\nbewildered nobleman to the door. He returned gently rubbing his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I said. \u201cAm I quite demented?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, _mon ami_, but you are, as always, in a mental fog.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you get the diamond.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom Mr. Rolf.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRolf?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mais oui!_ The warning letters, the Chinaman, the article in\r\n_Society Gossip_, all sprang from the ingenious brain of Mr. Rolf!\r\nThe two diamonds, supposed to be so miraculously alike\u2014bah! they\r\ndid not exist. There was only _one_ diamond, my friend! Originally\r\nin the Yardly collection, for three years it has been in the\r\npossession of Mr. Rolf. He stole it this morning with the assistance\r\nof a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye! Ah, I must\r\nsee him on the film, he is indeed an artist, _celui-l\u00e0_!\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why should he steal his own diamond?\u201d I asked, puzzled.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor many reasons. To begin with, Lady Yardly was getting restive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLady Yardly?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou comprehend she was left much alone in California. Her husband\r\nwas amusing himself elsewhere. Mr. Rolf was handsome, he had an\r\nair about him of romance. But _au fond_, he is very business-like,\r\n_ce monsieur_! He made love to Lady Yardly, and then he blackmailed\r\nher. I taxed the lady with the truth the other night, and she\r\nadmitted it. She swore that she had only been indiscreet, and I\r\nbelieve her. But, undoubtedly, Rolf had letters of hers that could\r\nbe twisted to bear a different interpretation. Terrified by the\r\nthreat of a divorce, and the prospect of being separated from her\r\nchildren, she agreed to all he wished. She had no money of her own,\r\nand she was forced to permit him to substitute a paste replica for\r\nthe real stone. The coincidence of the date of the appearance of\r\n\u2018the Western Star\u2019 struck me at once. All goes well. Lord Yardly\r\nprepares to range himself\u2014to settle down. And then comes the menace\r\nof the possible sale of the diamond. The substitution will be\r\ndiscovered. Without doubt she writes off frantically to Gregory\r\nRolf who has just arrived in England. He soothes her by promising\r\nto arrange all\u2014and prepares for a double robbery. In this way he\r\nwill quiet the lady, who might conceivably tell all to her husband,\r\nan affair which would not suit our blackmailer at all, he will have\r\n\u00a350,000 insurance money (aha, you had forgotten that!), and he will\r\nstill have the diamond! At this point I put my finger in the pie.\r\nThe arrival of a diamond expert is announced. Lady Yardly, as I\r\nfelt sure she would, immediately arranges a robbery\u2014and does it\r\nvery well too! But Hercule Poirot, he sees nothing but facts. What\r\nhappens in actuality? The lady switches off the light, bangs the\r\ndoor, throws the necklace down the passage, and screams. She has\r\nalready wrenched out the diamond with pliers upstairs\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut we saw the necklace round her neck!\u201d I objected.\r\n\r\n\u201cI demand pardon, my friend. Her hand concealed the part of it\r\nwhere the gap would have shown. To place a piece of silk in the\r\ndoor beforehand is child\u2019s play! Of course, as soon as Rolf read\r\nof the robbery, he arranged his own little comedy. And very well\r\nhe played it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d I asked with lively curiosity.\r\n\r\n\u201cI said to him that Lady Yardly had told her husband all, that I\r\nwas empowered to recover the jewel, and that if it were not\r\nimmediately handed over proceedings would be taken. Also a few more\r\nlittle lies which occurred to me. He was as wax in my hands!\u201d\r\n\r\nI pondered the matter.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems a little unfair on Mary Marvell. She has lost her diamond\r\nthrough no fault of her own.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBah!\u201d said Poirot brutally. \u201cShe has a magnificent advertisement.\r\nThat is all she cares for, that one! Now the other, she is\r\ndifferent. _Bonne m\u00e8re, tr\u00e8s femme!_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said doubtfully, hardly sharing Poirot\u2019s views on\r\nfemininity. \u201cI suppose it was Rolf who sent her the duplicate\r\nletters.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Pas du tout_,\u201d said Poirot briskly. \u201cShe came by the advice of\r\nMary Cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma. Then she heard that\r\nMary Marvell, whom she knew to be her enemy, had been here, and\r\nshe changed her mind, jumping at a pretext that _you_, my friend,\r\noffered her. A very few questions sufficed to show me that _you_\r\ntold her of the letters, not she you! She jumped at the chance your\r\nwords offered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d I cried, stung.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Si, si, mon ami_, it is a pity that you study not the psychology.\r\nShe told you that the letters were destroyed? Oh, la la, _never_\r\ndoes a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it! Not even if it\r\nwould be more prudent to do so!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very well,\u201d I said, my anger rising, \u201cbut you\u2019ve made a\r\nperfect fool of me! From beginning to end! No, it\u2019s all very well\r\nto try and explain it away afterwards. There really is a limit!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you were so enjoying yourself, my friend. I had not the heart\r\nto shatter your illusions.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no good. You\u2019ve gone a bit too far this time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon Dieu!_ but how you enrage yourself for nothing, _mon ami_!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fed up!\u201d I went out, banging the door. Poirot had made an\r\nabsolute laughing-stock of me. I decided that he needed a sharp\r\nlesson. I would let some time elapse before I forgave him. He had\r\nencouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  II\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Tragedy at Marsdon Manor\r\n\r\n\r\nI had been called away from town for a few days, and on my return\r\nfound Poirot in the act of strapping up his small valise.\r\n\r\n\u201c_A la bonne heure_, Hastings. I feared you would not have returned\r\nin time to accompany me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are called away on a case, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, though I am bound to admit that, on the face of it, the\r\naffair does not seem promising. The Northern Union Insurance\r\nCompany have asked me to investigate the death of a Mr. Maltravers\r\nwho a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum\r\nof fifty thousand pounds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d I said, much interested.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was, of course, the usual suicide clause in the policy. In\r\nthe event of his committing suicide within a year the premiums\r\nwould be forfeited. Mr. Maltravers was duly examined by the\r\nCompany\u2019s own doctor, and although he was a man slightly past the\r\nprime of life was passed as being in quite sound health. However,\r\non Wednesday last\u2014the day before yesterday\u2014the body of Mr.\r\nMaltravers was found in the grounds of his house in Essex, Marsdon\r\nManor, and the cause of his death is described as some kind of\r\ninternal h\u00e6morrhage. That in itself would be nothing remarkable,\r\nbut sinister rumours as to Mr. Maltravers\u2019 financial position have\r\nbeen in the air of late, and the Northern Union have ascertained\r\nbeyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon\r\nthe verge of bankruptcy. Now that alters matters considerably.\r\nMaltravers had a beautiful young wife, and it is suggested that he\r\ngot together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying\r\nthe premiums on a life insurance for his wife\u2019s benefit, and then\r\ncommitted suicide. Such a thing is not uncommon. In any case, my\r\nfriend Alfred Wright, who is a director of the Northern Union, has\r\nasked me to investigate the facts of the case, but, as I told him,\r\nI am not very hopeful of success. If the cause of the death had\r\nbeen heart failure, I should have been more sanguine. Heart failure\r\nmay always be translated as the inability of the local G.P. to\r\ndiscover what his patient really did die of, but a h\u00e6morrhage seems\r\nfairly definite. Still, we can but make some necessary inquiries.\r\nFive minutes to pack your bag, Hastings, and we will take a taxi\r\nto Liverpool Street.\u201d\r\n\r\nAbout an hour later, we alighted from a Great Eastern train at the\r\nlittle station of Marsdon Leigh. Inquiries at the station yielded\r\nthe information that Marsdon Manor was about a mile distant. Poirot\r\ndecided to walk, and we betook ourselves along the main street.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is our plan of campaign?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cFirst I will call upon the doctor. I have ascertained that there\r\nis only one doctor in Marsdon Leigh, Dr. Ralph Bernard. Ah, here\r\nwe are at his house.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe house in question was a kind of superior cottage, standing back\r\na little from the road. A brass plate on the gate bore the doctor\u2019s\r\nname. We passed up the path and rang the bell.\r\n\r\nWe proved to be fortunate in our call. It was the doctor\u2019s\r\nconsulting hour, and for the moment there were no patients waiting\r\nfor him. Dr. Bernard was an elderly man, high-shouldered and\r\nstooping, with a pleasant vagueness of manner.\r\n\r\nPoirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit,\r\nadding that Insurance Companies were bound to investigate fully in\r\na case of this kind.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d said Dr. Bernard vaguely. \u201cI suppose, as\r\nhe was such a rich man, his life was insured for a big sum?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou consider him a rich man, doctor?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked rather surprised.\r\n\r\n\u201cWas he not? He kept two cars, you know, and Marsdon Manor is a\r\npretty big place to keep up, although I believe he bought it very\r\ncheap.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand that he had had considerable losses of late,\u201d said\r\nPoirot, watching the doctor narrowly.\r\n\r\nThe latter, however, merely shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that so? Indeed. It is fortunate for his wife, then, that there\r\nis this life insurance. A very beautiful and charming young\r\ncreature, but terribly unstrung by this sad catastrophe. A mass of\r\nnerves, poor thing. I have tried to spare her all I can, but of\r\ncourse the shock was bound to be considerable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou had been attending Mr. Maltravers recently?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear sir, I never attended him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand Mr. Maltravers was a Christian Scientist\u2014or something\r\nof that kind.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you examined the body?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. I was fetched by one of the under-gardeners.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the cause of death was clear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely. There was blood on the lips, but most of the bleeding\r\nmust have been internal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas he still lying where he had been found?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, the body had not been touched. He was lying at the edge of\r\na small plantation. He had evidently been out shooting rooks, a\r\nsmall rook rifle lay beside him. The h\u00e6morrhage must have occurred\r\nquite suddenly. Gastric ulcer, without a doubt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo question of his having been shot, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear sir!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI demand pardon,\u201d said Poirot humbly. \u201cBut, if my memory is not\r\nat fault, in the case of a recent murder, the doctor first gave a\r\nverdict of heart failure\u2014altering it when the local constable\r\npointed out that there was a bullet wound through the head!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will not find any bullet wounds on the body of Mr. Maltravers,\u201d\r\nsaid Dr. Bernard dryly. \u201cNow, gentlemen, if there is nothing\r\nfurther\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nWe took the hint.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood morning, and many thanks to you, doctor, for so kindly\r\nanswering our questions. By the way, you saw no need for an\r\nautopsy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly not.\u201d The doctor became quite apoplectic. \u201cThe cause of\r\ndeath was clear, and in my profession we see no need to distress\r\nunduly the relatives of a dead patient.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd, turning, the doctor slammed the door sharply in our faces.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what do you think of Dr. Bernard, Hastings?\u201d inquired Poirot,\r\nas we proceeded on our way to the Manor.\r\n\r\n\u201cRather an old ass.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. Your judgments of character are always profound, my\r\nfriend.\u201d\r\n\r\nI glanced at him uneasily, but he seemed perfectly serious. A\r\ntwinkle, however, came into his eye, and he added slyly:\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is to say, when there is no question of a beautiful woman!\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked at him coldly.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival at the manor-house, the door was opened to us by a\r\nmiddle-aged parlourmaid. Poirot handed her his card, and a letter\r\nfrom the Insurance Company for Mrs. Maltravers. She showed us into\r\na small morning-room, and retired to tell her mistress. About ten\r\nminutes elapsed, and then the door opened, and a slender figure in\r\nwidow\u2019s weeds stood upon the threshold.\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur Poirot?\u201d she faltered.\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame!\u201d Poirot sprang gallantly to his feet and hastened towards\r\nher. \u201cI cannot tell you how I regret to derange you in this way.\r\nBut what will you? _Les affaires_\u2014they know no mercy.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair. Her eyes were\r\nred with weeping, but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal\r\nher extraordinary beauty. She was about twenty-seven or eight, and\r\nvery fair, with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is something about my husband\u2019s insurance, is it? But must I\r\nbe bothered _now_\u2014so soon?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCourage, my dear Madame. Courage! You see, your late husband\r\ninsured his life for rather a large sum, and in such a case the\r\nCompany always has to satisfy itself as to a few details. They have\r\nempowered me to act for them. You can rest assured that I will do\r\nall in my power to render the matter not too unpleasant for you.\r\nWill you recount to me briefly the sad events of Wednesday?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was changing for tea when my maid came up\u2014one of the gardeners\r\nhad just run to the house. He had found\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHer voice trailed away. Poirot pressed her hand sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\u201cI comprehend. Enough! You had seen your husband earlier in the\r\nafternoon?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot since lunch. I had walked down to the village for some stamps,\r\nand I believe he was out pottering round the grounds.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShooting rooks, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he usually took his little rook rifle with him, and I heard\r\none or two shots in the distance.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is this little rook rifle now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the hall, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe led the way out of the room and found and handed the little\r\nweapon to Poirot, who examined it cursorily.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo shots fired, I see,\u201d he observed, as he handed it back. \u201cAnd\r\nnow, madame, if I might see\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHe paused delicately.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe servant shall take you,\u201d she murmured, averting her head.\r\n\r\nThe parlourmaid, summoned, led Poirot upstairs. I remained with\r\nthe lovely and unfortunate woman. It was hard to know whether to\r\nspeak or remain silent. I essayed one or two general reflections\r\nto which she responded absently, and in a very few minutes Poirot\r\nrejoined us.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank you for all your courtesy, madame. I do not think you need\r\nbe troubled any further with this matter. By the way, do you know\r\nanything of your husband\u2019s financial position?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing whatever. I am very stupid over business things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see. Then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided\r\nto insure his life? He had not done so previously, I understand.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, we had only been married a little over a year. But, as to\r\nwhy he insured his life, it was because he had absolutely made up\r\nhis mind that he would not live long. He had a strong premonition\r\nof his own death. I gather that he had had one h\u00e6morrhage already,\r\nand that he knew that another one would prove fatal. I tried to\r\ndispel these gloomy fears of his, but without avail. Alas, he was\r\nonly too right!\u201d\r\n\r\nTears in her eyes, she bade us a dignified farewell. Poirot made\r\na characteristic gesture as we walked down the drive together.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien_, that is that! Back to London, my friend, there appears\r\nto be no mouse in this mouse-hole. And yet\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYet what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA slight discrepancy, that is all! You noticed it? You did not?\r\nStill, life is full of discrepancies, and assuredly the man cannot\r\nhave taken his own life\u2014there is no poison that would fill his\r\nmouth with blood. No, no, I must resign myself to the fact that\r\nall here is clear and above-board\u2014but who is this?\u201d\r\n\r\nA tall young man was striding up the drive towards us. He passed\r\nus without making any sign, but I noted that he was not ill-looking,\r\nwith a lean, deeply bronzed face that spoke of life in a tropic\r\nclime. A gardener who was sweeping up leaves had paused for a\r\nminute in his task, and Poirot ran quickly up to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me, I pray you, who is that gentleman? Do you know him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember his name, sir, though I did hear it. He was\r\nstaying down here last week for a night. Tuesday, it was.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick, _mon ami_, let us follow him.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe hastened up the drive after the retreating figure. A glimpse of\r\na black-robed figure on the terrace at the side of the house, and\r\nour quarry swerved and we after him, so that we were witnesses of\r\nthe meeting.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maltravers almost staggered where she stood, and her face\r\nblanched noticeably.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou,\u201d she gasped. \u201cI thought you were on the sea\u2014on your way to\r\nEast Africa?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI got some news from my lawyers that detained me,\u201d explained the\r\nyoung man. \u201cMy old uncle in Scotland died unexpectedly and left me\r\nsome money. Under the circumstances I thought it better to cancel\r\nmy passage. Then I saw this bad news in the paper and I came down\r\nto see if there was anything I could do. You\u2019ll want some one to\r\nlook after things for you a bit perhaps.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt that moment they became aware of our presence. Poirot stepped\r\nforward, and with many apologies explained that he had left his\r\nstick in the hall. Rather reluctantly, it seemed to me, Mrs.\r\nMaltravers made the necessary introduction.\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur Poirot, Captain Black.\u201d\r\n\r\nA few minutes\u2019 chat ensued, in the course of which Poirot elicited\r\nthe fact that Captain Black was putting up at the Anchor Inn. The\r\nmissing stick not having been discovered (which was not surprising),\r\nPoirot uttered more apologies and we withdrew.\r\n\r\nWe returned to the village at a great pace, and Poirot made a bee\r\nline for the Anchor Inn.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere we establish ourselves until our friend the Captain returns,\u201d\r\nhe explained. \u201cYou notice that I emphasized the point that we were\r\nreturning to London by the first train? Possibly you thought I\r\nmeant it. But no\u2014you observed Mrs. Maltravers\u2019 face when she caught\r\nsight of this young Black? She was clearly taken aback, and he\u2014_eh\r\nbien_, he was very devoted, did you not think so? And he was here\r\non Tuesday night\u2014the day before Mr. Maltravers died. We must\r\ninvestigate the doings of Captain Black, Hastings.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn about half an hour we espied our quarry approaching the inn.\r\nPoirot went out and accosted him and presently brought him up to\r\nthe room we had engaged.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been telling Captain Black of the mission which brings us\r\nhere,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou can understand, _monsieur le capitaine_,\r\nthat I am anxious to arrive at Mr. Maltravers\u2019 state of mind\r\nimmediately before his death, and that at the same time I do not\r\nwish to distress Mrs. Maltravers unduly by asking her painful\r\nquestions. Now, you were here just before the occurrence, and can\r\ngive us equally valuable information.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do anything I can to help you, I\u2019m sure,\u201d replied the young\r\nsoldier; \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t notice anything out of the\r\nordinary. You see, although Maltravers was an old friend of my\r\npeople\u2019s, I didn\u2019t know him very well myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou came down\u2014when?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTuesday afternoon. I went up to town early Wednesday morning, as\r\nmy boat sailed from Tilbury about twelve o\u2019clock. But some news I\r\ngot made me alter my plans, as I dare say you heard me explain to\r\nMrs. Maltravers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were returning to East Africa, I understand?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. I\u2019ve been out there ever since the War\u2014a great country.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. Now what was the talk about at dinner on Tuesday night?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. The usual odd topics. Maltravers asked after my\r\npeople, and then we discussed the question of German reparations,\r\nand then Mrs. Maltravers asked a lot of questions about East\r\nAfrica, and I told them one or two yarns, that\u2019s about all, I\r\nthink.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot was silent for a moment, then he said gently: \u201cWith your\r\npermission, I should like to try a little experiment. You have told\r\nus all that your conscious self knows, I want now to question your\r\nsubconscious self.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPsychoanalysis, what?\u201d said Black, with visible alarm.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Poirot reassuringly. \u201cYou see, it is like this, I\r\ngive you a word, you answer with another, and so on. Any word, the\r\nfirst one you think of. Shall we begin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Black slowly, but he looked uneasy.\r\n\r\n\u201cNote down the words, please, Hastings,\u201d said Poirot. Then he took\r\nfrom his pocket his big turnip-faced watch and laid it on the table\r\nbeside him. \u201cWe will commence. Day.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\u2019s pause, and then Black replied:\r\n\r\n\u201c_Night_.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Poirot proceeded, his answers came quicker.\r\n\r\n\u201cName,\u201d said Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Place_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBernard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Shaw_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTuesday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Dinner_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJourney.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Ship_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCountry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Uganda_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cStory.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Lions_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRook Rifle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Farm_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Suicide_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cElephant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Tusks_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMoney.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Lawyers_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Captain Black. Perhaps you could spare me a few minutes\r\nin about half an hour\u2019s time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d The young soldier looked at him curiously and wiped\r\nhis brow as he got up.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now, Hastings,\u201d said Poirot, smiling at me as the door closed\r\nbehind him. \u201cYou see it all, do you not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes that list of words tell you nothing?\u201d\r\n\r\nI scrutinized it, but was forced to shake my head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will assist you. To begin with, Black answered well within the\r\nnormal time limit, with no pauses, so we can take it that he\r\nhimself has no guilty knowledge to conceal. \u2018Day\u2019 to \u2018Night\u2019 and\r\n\u2018Place\u2019 to \u2018Name\u2019 are normal associations. I began work with\r\n\u2018Bernard\u2019 which might have suggested the local doctor had he come\r\nacross him at all. Evidently he had not. After our recent\r\nconversation, he gave \u2018Dinner\u2019 to my \u2018Tuesday,\u2019 but \u2018Journey\u2019 and\r\n\u2018Country\u2019 were answered by \u2018Ship\u2019 and \u2018Uganda,\u2019 showing clearly\r\nthat it was his journey abroad that was important to him and not\r\nthe one which brought him down here. \u2018Story\u2019 recalls to him one of\r\nthe \u2018Lion\u2019 stories he told at dinner. I proceed to \u2018Rook Rifle\u2019\r\nand he answered with the totally unexpected word \u2018Farm.\u2019 When I\r\nsay \u2018Shot,\u2019 he answers at once \u2018Suicide.\u2019 The association seems\r\nclear. A man he knows committed suicide with a rook rifle on a farm\r\nsomewhere. Remember, too, that his mind is still on the stories he\r\ntold at dinner, and I think you will agree that I shall not be far\r\nfrom the truth if I recall Captain Black and ask him to repeat the\r\nparticular suicide story which he told at the dinner-table on\r\nTuesday evening.\u201d\r\n\r\nBlack was straightforward enough over the matter.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I did tell them that story now that I come to think of it.\r\nChap shot himself on a farm out there. Did it with a rook rifle\r\nthrough the roof of the mouth, bullet lodged in the brain. Doctors\r\nwere no end puzzled over it\u2014there was nothing to show except a\r\nlittle blood on the lips. But what\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat has it got to do with Mr. Maltravers? You did not know, I\r\nsee, that he was found with a rook rifle by his side.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean my story suggested to him\u2014oh, but that is awful!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not distress yourself\u2014it would have been one way or another.\r\nWell, I must get on the telephone to London.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot had a lengthy conversation over the wire, and came back\r\nthoughtful. He went off by himself in the afternoon, and it was\r\nnot till seven o\u2019clock that he announced that he could put it off\r\nno longer, but must break the news to the young widow. My sympathy\r\nhad already gone out to her unreservedly. To be left penniless,\r\nand with the knowledge that her husband had killed himself to\r\nassure her future was a hard burden for any woman to bear. I\r\ncherished a secret hope, however, that young Black might prove\r\ncapable of consoling her after her first grief had passed. He\r\nevidently admired her enormously.\r\n\r\nOur interview with the lady was painful. She refused vehemently to\r\nbelieve the facts that Poirot advanced, and when she was at last\r\nconvinced broke down into bitter weeping. An examination of the\r\nbody turned our suspicions into certainty. Poirot was very sorry\r\nfor the poor lady, but, after all, he was employed by the Insurance\r\nCompany, and what could he do? As he was preparing to leave he said\r\ngently to Mrs. Maltravers:\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame, you of all people should know that there are no dead!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she faltered, her eyes growing wide.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you never taken part in any spiritualistic s\u00e9ances? You are\r\nmediumistic, you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been told so. But you do not believe in Spiritualism,\r\nsurely?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame, I have seen some strange things. You know that they say\r\nin the village that this house is haunted?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe nodded, and at that moment the parlourmaid announced that\r\ndinner was ready.\r\n\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t you just stay and have something to eat?\u201d\r\n\r\nWe accepted gratefully, and I felt that our presence could not but\r\nhelp distract her a little from her own griefs.\r\n\r\nWe had just finished our soup, when there was a scream outside the\r\ndoor, and the sound of breaking crockery. We jumped up. The\r\nparlourmaid appeared, her hand to her heart.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a man\u2014standing in the passage.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot rushed out, returning quickly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no one there.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there, sir?\u201d said the parlourmaid weakly. \u201cOh, it did give\r\nme a start!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe dropped her voice to a whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought\u2014I thought it was the master\u2014it looked like \u2019im.\u201d\r\n\r\nI saw Mrs. Maltravers give a terrified start, and my mind flew to\r\nthe old superstition that a suicide cannot rest. She thought of it\r\ntoo, I am sure, for a minute later, she caught Poirot\u2019s arm with\r\na scream.\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear that? Those three taps on the window? That\u2019s how\r\n_he_ always used to tap when he passed round the house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe ivy,\u201d I cried. \u201cIt was the ivy against the pane.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut a sort of terror was gaining on us all. The parlourmaid was\r\nobviously unstrung, and when the meal was over Mrs. Maltravers\r\nbesought Poirot not to go at once. She was clearly terrified to be\r\nleft alone. We sat in the little morning-room. The wind was getting\r\nup, and moaning round the house in an eerie fashion. Twice the door\r\nof the room came unlatched and the door slowly opened, and each\r\ntime she clung to me with a terrified gasp.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, but this door, it is bewitched!\u201d cried\r\n\r\nPoirot angrily at last. He got up and shut it once more, then\r\nturned the key in the lock. \u201cI shall lock it, so!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d she gasped, \u201cif it should come open now\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd even as she spoke the impossible happened. The locked door\r\nslowly swung open. I could not see into the passage from where I\r\nsat, but she and Poirot were facing it. She gave one long shriek\r\nas she turned to him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou saw him\u2014there in the passage?\u201d she cried.\r\n\r\nHe was staring down at her with a puzzled face, then shook his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\u201cI saw him\u2014my husband\u2014you must have seen him too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame, I saw nothing. You are not well\u2014unstrung\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am perfectly well, I\u2014\u2014Oh, God!\u201d\r\n\r\nSuddenly, without any warning, the lights quivered and went out.\r\nOut of the darkness came three loud raps. I could hear Mrs.\r\nMaltravers moaning.\r\n\r\nAnd then\u2014I saw!\r\n\r\nThe man I had seen on the bed upstairs stood there facing us,\r\ngleaming with a faint ghostly light. There was blood on his lips,\r\nand he held his right hand out, pointing. Suddenly a brilliant\r\nlight seemed to proceed from it. It passed over Poirot and me, and\r\nfell on Mrs. Maltravers. I saw her white terrified face, and\r\nsomething else!\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God, Poirot!\u201d I cried. \u201cLook at her hand, her right hand. It\u2019s\r\nall red!\u201d\r\n\r\nHer own eyes fell on it, and she collapsed in a heap on the floor.\r\n\r\n\u201cBlood,\u201d she cried hysterically. \u201cYes, it\u2019s blood. I killed him.\r\nI did it. He was showing me, and then I put my hand on the trigger\r\nand pressed. Save me from him\u2014save me! he\u2019s come back!\u201d\r\n\r\nHer voice died away in a gurgle.\r\n\r\n\u201cLights,\u201d said Poirot briskly.\r\n\r\nThe lights went on as if by magic.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou heard, Hastings? And you, Everett?\r\nOh, by the way, this is Mr. Everett, rather a fine member of the\r\ntheatrical profession. I \u2019phoned to him this afternoon. His make-up\r\nis good, isn\u2019t it? Quite like the dead man, and with a pocket torch\r\nand the necessary phosphorescence he made the proper impression.\r\nI shouldn\u2019t touch her right hand if I were you, Hastings. Red paint\r\nmarks so. When the lights went out I clasped her hand, you see. By\r\nthe way, we mustn\u2019t miss our train. Inspector Japp is outside the\r\nwindow. A bad night\u2014but he has been able to while away the time by\r\ntapping on the window every now and then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d continued Poirot, as we walked briskly through the wind\r\nand rain, \u201cthere was a little discrepancy. The doctor seemed to\r\nthink the deceased was a Christian Scientist, and who could have\r\ngiven him that impression but Mrs. Maltravers? But to us she\r\nrepresented him as being in a grave state of apprehension about\r\nhis own health. Again, why was she so taken aback by the reappearance\r\nof young Black? And lastly, although I know that convention decrees\r\nthat a woman must make a decent pretence of mourning for her\r\nhusband, I do not care for such heavily-rouged eyelids! You did\r\nnot observe them, Hastings? No? As I always tell you, you see\r\nnothing!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there it was. There were the two possibilities. Did Black\u2019s\r\nstory suggest an ingenious method of committing suicide to Mr.\r\nMaltravers, or did his other listener, the wife, see an equally\r\ningenious method of committing murder? I inclined to the latter\r\nview. To shoot himself in the way indicated, he would probably have\r\nhad to pull the trigger with his toe\u2014or at least so I imagine.\r\nNow if Maltravers had been found with one boot off, we should\r\nalmost certainly have heard of it from some one. An odd detail like\r\nthat would have been remembered.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, as I say, I inclined to the view that it was a case of murder,\r\nnot suicide, but I realized that I had not a shadow of proof in\r\nsupport of my theory. Hence the elaborate little comedy you saw\r\nplayed to-night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEven now I don\u2019t quite see all the details of the crime?\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us start from the beginning. Here is a shrewd and scheming\r\nwoman who, knowing of her husband\u2019s financial _d\u00e9b\u00e2cle_ and tired\r\nof the elderly mate she has only married for his money, induces\r\nhim to insure his life for a large sum, and then seeks for the\r\nmeans to accomplish her purpose. An accident gives her that\u2014the\r\nyoung soldier\u2019s strange story. The next afternoon when _monsieur\r\nle capitaine_, as she thinks, is on the high seas, she and her\r\nhusband are strolling round the grounds. \u2018What a curious story that\r\nwas last night!\u2019 she observes. \u2018Could a man shoot himself in such\r\na way? Do show me if it is possible!\u2019 The poor fool\u2014he shows her.\r\nHe places the end of the rifle in his mouth. She stoops down, and\r\nputs her finger on the trigger, laughing up at him. \u2018And now, sir,\u2019\r\nshe says saucily, \u2018supposing I pull the trigger?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then\u2014and then, Hastings\u2014she pulls it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  III\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Adventure of the Cheap Flat\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far, in the cases which I have recorded, Poirot\u2019s investigations\r\nhave started from the central fact, whether murder or robbery, and\r\nhave proceeded from thence by a process of logical deduction to\r\nthe final triumphant unravelling. In the events I am now about to\r\nchronicle, a remarkable chain of circumstances led from the\r\napparently trivial incidents which first attracted Poirot\u2019s\r\nattention to the sinister happenings which completed a most unusual\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nI had been spending the evening with an old friend of mine, Gerald\r\nParker. There had been, perhaps, about half a dozen people there\r\nbesides my host and myself, and the talk fell, as it was bound to\r\ndo sooner or later wherever Parker found himself, on the subject\r\nof house-hunting in London. Houses and flats were Parker\u2019s special\r\nhobby. Since the end of the War, he had occupied at least half a\r\ndozen different flats and maisonnettes. No sooner was he settled\r\nanywhere than he would light unexpectedly upon a new find, and\r\nwould forthwith depart bag and baggage. His moves were nearly\r\nalways accomplished at a slight pecuniary gain, for he had a shrewd\r\nbusiness head, but it was sheer love of the sport that actuated\r\nhim, and not a desire to make money at it. We listened to Parker\r\nfor some time with the respect of the novice for the expert. Then\r\nit was our turn, and a perfect babel of tongues was let loose.\r\nFinally the floor was left to Mrs. Robinson, a charming little\r\nbride who was there with her husband. I had never met them before,\r\nas Robinson was only a recent acquaintance of Parker\u2019s.\r\n\r\n\u201cTalking of flats,\u201d she said, \u201chave you heard of our piece of luck,\r\nMr. Parker? We\u2019ve got a flat\u2014at last! In Montagu Mansions.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Parker, \u201cI\u2019ve always said there are plenty of flats\u2014at\r\na price!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but this isn\u2019t at a price. It\u2019s dirt cheap. Eighty pounds a\r\nyear!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut\u2014but Montagu Mansions is just off Knightsbridge, isn\u2019t it? Big\r\nhandsome building. Or are you talking of a poor relation of the\r\nsame name stuck in the slums somewhere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s the Knightsbridge one. That\u2019s what makes it so wonderful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWonderful is the word! It\u2019s a blinking miracle. But there must be\r\na catch somewhere. Big premium, I suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo premium!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo prem\u2014oh, hold my head, somebody!\u201d groaned Parker.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve got to buy the furniture,\u201d continued Mrs. Robinson.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d Parker brisked up. \u201cI knew there was a catch!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor fifty pounds. And it\u2019s beautifully furnished!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI give it up,\u201d said Parker. \u201cThe present occupants must be lunatics\r\nwith a taste for philanthropy.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Robinson was looking a little troubled. A little pucker\r\nappeared between her dainty brows.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt _is_ queer, isn\u2019t it? You don\u2019t think that\u2014that\u2014the place is\r\n_haunted_?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever heard of a haunted flat,\u201d declared Parker decisively.\r\n\r\n\u201cN-o.\u201d Mrs. Robinson appeared far from convinced. \u201cBut there were\r\nseveral things about it all that struck me as\u2014well, queer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor instance\u2014\u2014\u201d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Parker, \u201cour criminal expert\u2019s attention is aroused!\r\nUnburden yourself to him, Mrs. Robinson. Hastings is a great\r\nunraveller of mysteries.\u201d\r\n\r\nI laughed, embarrassed but not wholly displeased with the r\u00f4le\r\nthrust upon me.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, not really queer, Captain Hastings, but when we went to the\r\nagents, Stosser and Paul\u2014we hadn\u2019t tried them before because they\r\nonly have the expensive Mayfair flats, but we thought at any rate\r\nit would do no harm\u2014everything they offered us was four and five\r\nhundred a year, or else huge premiums, and then, just as we were\r\ngoing, they mentioned that they had a flat at eighty, but that they\r\ndoubted if it would be any good our going there, because it had\r\nbeen on their books some time and they had sent so many people to\r\nsee it that it was almost sure to be taken\u2014\u2018snapped up\u2019 as the\r\nclerk put it\u2014only people were so tiresome in not letting them know,\r\nand then they went on sending, and people get annoyed at being sent\r\nto a place that had, perhaps, been let some time.\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Robinson paused for some much needed breath, and then\r\ncontinued: \u201cWe thanked him, and said that we quite\r\nunderstood it would probably be no good, but that we should\r\nlike an order all the same\u2014just in case. And we went there\r\nstraight away in a taxi, for, after all, you never know. No.\r\n4 was on the second floor, and just as we were waiting for\r\nthe lift, Elsie Ferguson\u2014she\u2019s a friend of mine, Captain\r\nHastings, and they are looking for a flat too\u2014came hurrying\r\ndown the stairs. \u2018Ahead of you for once, my dear,\u2019 she said.\r\n\u2018But it\u2019s no good. It\u2019s already let.\u2019 That seemed to finish\r\nit, but\u2014well, as John said, the place was very cheap, we\r\ncould afford to give more, and perhaps if we offered a\r\npremium.\u2014\u2014A horrid thing to do, of course, and I feel quite\r\nashamed of telling you, but you know what flat-hunting is.\u201d\r\n\r\nI assured her that I was well aware that in the struggle for\r\nhouse-room the baser side of human nature frequently triumphed over\r\nthe higher, and that the well-known rule of dog eat dog always\r\napplied.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo we went up and, would you believe it, the flat wasn\u2019t let at\r\nall. We were shown over it by the maid, and then we saw the\r\nmistress, and the thing was settled then and there. Immediate\r\npossession and fifty pounds for the furniture. We signed the\r\nagreement next day, and we are to move in to-morrow!\u201d Mrs. Robinson\r\npaused triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what about Mrs. Ferguson?\u201d asked Parker. \u201cLet\u2019s have your\r\ndeductions, Hastings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Obvious, my dear Watson,\u2019\u201d I quoted lightly. \u201cShe went to the\r\nwrong flat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Captain Hastings, how clever of you!\u201d cried Mrs. Robinson\r\nadmiringly.\r\n\r\nI rather wished Poirot had been there. Sometimes I have the feeling\r\nthat he rather underestimates my capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole thing was rather amusing, and I propounded the thing as\r\na mock problem to Poirot on the following morning. He seemed\r\ninterested, and questioned me rather narrowly as to the rents of\r\nflats in various localities.\r\n\r\n\u201cA curious story,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cExcuse me, Hastings, I\r\nmust take a short stroll.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen he returned, about an hour later, his eyes were gleaming with\r\na peculiar excitement. He laid his stick on the table, and brushed\r\nthe nap of his hat with his usual tender care before he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is as well, _mon ami_, that we have no affairs of moment on\r\nhand. We can devote ourselves wholly to the present investigation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat investigation are you talking about?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe remarkable cheapness of your friend\u2019s, Mrs. Robinson\u2019s, new\r\nflat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot, you are not serious!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am most serious. Figure to yourself, my friend, that the real\r\nrent of those flats is \u00a3350. I have just ascertained that from the\r\nlandlord\u2019s agents. And yet this particular flat is being sublet at\r\neighty pounds! Why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere must be something wrong with it. Perhaps it is haunted, as\r\nMrs. Robinson suggested.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head in a dissatisfied manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen again how curious it is that her friend tells her the flat\r\nis let, and, when she goes up, behold, it is not so at all!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut surely you agree with me that the other woman must have gone\r\nto the wrong flat. That is the only possible solution.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may or may not be right on that point, Hastings. The fact\r\nstill remains that numerous other applicants were sent to see it,\r\nand yet, in spite of its remarkable cheapness, it was still in the\r\nmarket when Mrs. Robinson arrived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat shows that there must be something wrong about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Robinson did not seem to notice anything amiss. Very curious,\r\nis it not? Did she impress you as being a truthful woman, Hastings?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was a delightful creature!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_\u00c9videmment!_ since she renders you incapable of replying to my\r\nquestion. Describe her to me, then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, she\u2019s tall and fair; her hair\u2019s really a beautiful shade of\r\nauburn\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlways you have had a penchant for auburn hair!\u201d murmured Poirot.\r\n\u201cBut continue.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBlue eyes and a very nice complexion and\u2014well, that\u2019s all, I\r\nthink,\u201d I concluded lamely.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd her husband?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s quite a nice fellow\u2014nothing startling.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDark or fair?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014betwixt and between, and just an ordinary sort of\r\nface.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, there are hundreds of these average men\u2014and, anyway, you\r\nbring more sympathy and appreciation to your description of women.\r\nDo you know anything about these people? Does Parker know them\r\nwell.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are just recent acquaintances, I believe. But surely, Poirot,\r\nyou don\u2019t think for an instant\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot raised his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Tout doucement, mon ami_. Have I said that I think anything? All\r\nI say is\u2014it is a curious story. And there is nothing to throw light\r\nupon it; except perhaps the lady\u2019s name, eh, Hastings?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHer name is Stella,\u201d I said stiffly, \u201cbut I don\u2019t see\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot interrupted me with a tremendous chuckle. Something seemed\r\nto be amusing him vastly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Stella means a star, does it not? Famous!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat on earth\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd stars give light! _Voil\u00e0!_ Calm yourself, Hastings. Do not\r\nput on that air of injured dignity. Come, we will go to Montagu\r\nMansions and make a few inquiries.\u201d\r\n\r\nI accompanied him, nothing loath. The Mansions were a handsome\r\nblock of buildings in excellent repair. A uniformed porter was\r\nsunning himself on the threshold, and it was to him that Poirot\r\naddressed himself:\r\n\r\n\u201cPardon, but could you tell me if a Mr. and Mrs. Robinson reside\r\nhere?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe porter was a man of few words and apparently of a sour or\r\nsuspicious disposition. He hardly looked at us and grunted out:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. 4. Second floor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thank you. Can you tell me how long they have been here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSix months.\u201d\r\n\r\nI started forward in amazement, conscious as I did so of Poirot\u2019s\r\nmalicious grin.\r\n\r\n\u201cImpossible,\u201d I cried. \u201cYou must be making a mistake.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSix months.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you sure? The lady I mean is tall and fair with reddish gold\r\nhair and\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s \u2019er,\u201d said the porter. \u201cCome in the Michaelmas quarter,\r\nthey did. Just six months ago.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe appeared to lose interest in us and retreated slowly up the\r\nhall. I followed Poirot outside.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien_, Hastings?\u201d my friend demanded slyly. \u201cAre you so sure\r\nnow that delightful women always speak the truth?\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not reply.\r\n\r\nPoirot had steered his way into Brompton Road before I asked him\r\nwhat he was going to do and where we were going.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the house agents, Hastings. I have a great desire to have a\r\nflat in Montagu Mansions. If I am not mistaken, several interesting\r\nthings will take place there before long.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe were fortunate in our quest. No. 8, on the fourth floor, was to\r\nbe let furnished at ten guineas a week. Poirot promptly took it\r\nfor a month. Outside in the street again, he silenced my protests:\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I make money nowadays! Why should I not indulge a whim? By\r\nthe way, Hastings, have you a revolver?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014somewhere,\u201d I answered, slightly thrilled. \u201cDo you think\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat you will need it? It is quite possible. The idea pleases you,\r\nI see. Always the spectacular and romantic appeals to you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe following day saw us installed in our temporary home. The flat\r\nwas pleasantly furnished. It occupied the same position in the\r\nbuilding as that of the Robinsons, but was two floors higher.\r\n\r\nThe day after our installation was a Sunday. In the afternoon,\r\nPoirot left the front door ajar, and summoned me hastily as a bang\r\nreverberated from somewhere below.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook over the banisters. Are those your friends. Do not let them\r\nsee you.\u201d\r\n\r\nI craned my neck over the staircase.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s them,\u201d I declared in an ungrammatical whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood. Wait awhile.\u201d\r\n\r\nAbout half an hour later, a young woman emerged in brilliant and\r\nvaried clothing. With a sigh of satisfaction, Poirot tiptoed back\r\ninto the flat.\r\n\r\n\u201c_C\u2019est \u00e7a_. After the master and mistress, the maid. The flat\r\nshould now be empty.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d I asked uneasily.\r\n\r\nPoirot had trotted briskly into the scullery and was hauling at\r\nthe rope of the coal-lift.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are about to descend after the method of the dustbins,\u201d he\r\nexplained cheerfully. \u201cNo one will observe us. The Sunday concert,\r\nthe Sunday \u2018afternoon out,\u2019 and finally the Sunday nap after the\r\nSunday dinner of England\u2014_le rosbif_\u2014all these will distract\r\nattention from the doings of Hercule Poirot. Come, my friend.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stepped into the rough wooden contrivance and I followed him\r\ngingerly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAre we going to break into the flat?\u201d I asked dubiously.\r\n\r\nPoirot\u2019s answer was not too reassuring:\r\n\r\n\u201cNot precisely to-day,\u201d he replied.\r\n\r\nPulling on the rope, we descended slowly till we reached the second\r\nfloor. Poirot uttered an exclamation of satisfaction as he perceived\r\nthat the wooden door into the scullery was open.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou observe? Never do they bolt these doors in the daytime. And\r\nyet anyone could mount or descend as we have done. At night\r\nyes\u2014though not always then\u2014and it is against that that we are going\r\nto make provision.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe had drawn some tools from his pocket as he spoke, and at once\r\nset deftly to work, his object being to arrange the bolt so that\r\nit could be pulled back from the lift. The operation only occupied\r\nabout three minutes. Then Poirot returned the tools to his pocket,\r\nand we reascended once more to our own domain.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Monday Poirot was out all day, but when he returned in the\r\nevening he flung himself into his chair with a sigh of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cHastings, shall I recount to you a little history? A story after\r\nyour own heart and which will remind you of your favourite cinema?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d I laughed. \u201cI presume that it is a true story, not one\r\nof your efforts of fancy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is true enough. Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard will vouch for\r\nits accuracy, since it was through his kind offices that it came\r\nto my ears. Listen, Hastings. A little over six months ago some\r\nimportant Naval plans were stolen from an American Government\r\ndepartment. They showed the position of some of the most important\r\nHarbour defences, and would be worth a considerable sum to any\r\nforeign Government\u2014that of Japan, for example. Suspicion fell upon\r\na young man named Luigi Valdarno, an Italian by birth, who was\r\nemployed in a minor capacity in the Department and who was missing\r\nat the same time as the papers. Whether Luigi Valdarno was the\r\nthief or not, he was found two days later on the East Side in New\r\nYork, shot dead. The papers were not on him. Now for some time past\r\nLuigi Valdarno had been going about with a Miss Elsa Hardt, a young\r\nconcert singer who had recently appeared and who lived with a\r\nbrother in an apartment in Washington. Nothing was known of the\r\nantecedents of Miss Elsa Hardt, and she disappeared suddenly about\r\nthe time of Valdarno\u2019s death. There are reasons for believing that\r\nshe was in reality an accomplished international spy who has done\r\nmuch nefarious work under various _aliases_. The American Secret\r\nService, whilst doing their best to trace her, also kept an eye\r\nupon certain insignificant Japanese gentlemen living in Washington.\r\nThey felt pretty certain that, when Elsa Hardt had covered her\r\ntracks sufficiently, she would approach the gentlemen in question.\r\nOne of them left suddenly for England a fortnight ago. On the face\r\nof it, therefore, it would seem that Elsa Hardt is in England.\u201d\r\nPoirot paused, and then added softly: \u201cThe official description of\r\nElsa Hardt is: Height 5 ft. 7, eyes blue, hair auburn, fair\r\ncomplexion, nose straight, no special distinguishing marks.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Robinson!\u201d I gasped.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there is a chance of it, anyhow,\u201d amended Poirot. \u201cAlso, I\r\nlearn that a swarthy man, a foreigner of some kind, was inquiring\r\nabout the occupants of No. 4 only this morning. Therefore, _mon\r\nami_, I fear that you must forswear your beauty sleep to-night,\r\nand join me in my all-night vigil in the flat below\u2014armed with that\r\nexcellent revolver of yours, _bien entendu_!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRather,\u201d I cried with enthusiasm. \u201cWhen shall we start?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe hour of midnight is both solemn and suitable, I fancy. Nothing\r\nis likely to occur before then.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt twelve o\u2019clock precisely, we crept cautiously into the coal-lift\r\nand lowered ourselves to the second floor. Under Poirot\u2019s\r\nmanipulation, the wooden door quickly swung inwards, and we climbed\r\ninto the flat. From the scullery we passed into the kitchen where\r\nwe established ourselves comfortably in two chairs with the door\r\ninto the hall ajar.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow we have but to wait,\u201d said Poirot contentedly, closing his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nTo me, the waiting appeared endless. I was terrified of going to\r\nsleep. Just when it seemed to me that I had been there about eight\r\nhours\u2014and had, as I found out afterwards, in reality been exactly\r\none hour and twenty minutes\u2014a faint scratching sound came to my\r\nears. Poirot\u2019s hand touched mine. I rose, and together we moved\r\ncarefully in the direction of the hall. The noise came from there.\r\nPoirot placed his lips to my ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cOutside the front door. They are cutting out the lock. When I give\r\nthe word, not before, fall upon him from behind and hold him fast.\r\nBe careful, he will have a knife.\u201d\r\n\r\nPresently there was a rending sound, and a little circle of light\r\nappeared through the door. It was extinguished immediately and then\r\nthe door was slowly opened. Poirot and I flattened ourselves\r\nagainst the wall. I heard a man\u2019s breathing as he passed us. Then\r\nhe flashed on his torch, and as he did so, Poirot hissed in my ear:\r\n\r\n\u201c_Allez_.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe sprang together, Poirot with a quick movement enveloped the\r\nintruder\u2019s head with a light woollen scarf whilst I pinioned his\r\narms. The whole affair was quick and noiseless. I twisted a dagger\r\nfrom his hand, and as Poirot brought down the scarf from his eyes,\r\nwhilst keeping it wound tightly round his mouth, I jerked up my\r\nrevolver where he could see it and understand that resistance was\r\nuseless. As he ceased to struggle Poirot put his mouth close to\r\nhis ear and began to whisper rapidly. After a minute the man\r\nnodded. Then enjoining silence with a movement of the hand, Poirot\r\nled the way out of the flat and down the stairs. Our captive\r\nfollowed, and I brought up the rear with the revolver. When we were\r\nout in the street, Poirot turned to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is a taxi waiting just round the corner. Give me the\r\nrevolver. We shall not need it now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut if this fellow tries to escape?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe will not.\u201d\r\n\r\nI returned in a minute with the waiting taxi. The scarf had been\r\nunwound from the stranger\u2019s face, and I gave a start of surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a Jap,\u201d I ejaculated in a whisper to Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cObservation was always your strong point, Hastings! Nothing\r\nescapes you. No, the man is not a Jap. He is an Italian.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe got into the taxi, and Poirot gave the driver an address in St.\r\nJohn\u2019s Wood. I was by now completely fogged. I did not like to ask\r\nPoirot where we were going in front of our captive, and strove in\r\nvain to obtain some light upon the proceedings.\r\n\r\nWe alighted at the door of a small house standing back from the\r\nroad. A returning wayfarer, slightly drunk, was lurching along the\r\npavement and almost collided with Poirot, who said something\r\nsharply to him which I did not catch. All three of us went up the\r\nsteps of the house. Poirot rang the bell and motioned us to stand\r\na little aside. There was no answer and he rang again and then\r\nseized the knocker which he plied for some minutes vigorously.\r\n\r\nA light appeared suddenly above the fanlight, and the door was\r\nopened cautiously a little way.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the devil do you want?\u201d a man\u2019s voice demanded harshly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want the doctor. My wife is taken ill.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doctor here.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man prepared to shut the door, but Poirot thrust his foot in\r\nadroitly. He became suddenly a perfect caricature of an infuriated\r\nFrenchman.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat you say, there is no doctor? I will have the law of you. You\r\nmust come! I will stay here and ring and knock all night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear sir\u2014\u2014\u201d The door was opened again, the man, clad in a\r\ndressing-gown and slippers, stepped forward to pacify Poirot with\r\nan uneasy glance round.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will call the police.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot prepared to descend the steps.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t do that for Heaven\u2019s sake!\u201d The man dashed after him.\r\n\r\nWith a neat push Poirot sent him staggering down the steps. In\r\nanother minute all three of us were inside the door and it was\r\npushed to and bolted.\r\n\r\n\u201cQuick\u2014in here.\u201d Poirot led the way into the nearest room switching\r\non the light as he did so. \u201cAnd you\u2014behind the curtain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSi, signor,\u201d said the Italian and slid rapidly behind the full\r\nfolds of rose-coloured velvet which draped the embrasure of the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nNot a minute too soon. Just as he disappeared from view a woman\r\nrushed into the room. She was tall with reddish hair and held a\r\nscarlet kimono round her slender form.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere is my husband?\u201d she cried, with a quick frightened glance.\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot stepped forward with a bow.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is to be hoped your husband will not suffer from a chill. I\r\nobserved that he had slippers on his feet, and that his dressing-gown\r\nwas a warm one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are you? What are you doing in my house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is true that none of us have the pleasure of your acquaintance,\r\nmadame. It is especially to be regretted as one of our number has\r\ncome specially from New York in order to meet you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe curtains parted and the Italian stepped out. To my horror I\r\nobserved that he was brandishing my revolver, which Poirot must\r\ndoubtless have put down through inadvertence in the cab.\r\n\r\nThe woman gave a piercing scream and turned to fly, but Poirot was\r\nstanding in front of the closed door.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me by,\u201d she shrieked. \u201cHe will murder me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho was it dat croaked Luigi Valdarno?\u201d asked the Italian hoarsely,\r\nbrandishing the weapon, and sweeping each one of us with it. We\r\ndared not move.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God, Poirot, this is awful. What shall we do?\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will oblige me by refraining from talking so much, Hastings.\r\nI can assure you that our friend will not shoot until I give the\r\nword.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYouse sure o\u2019 dat, eh?\u201d said the Italian, leering unpleasantly.\r\n\r\nIt was more than I was, but the woman turned to Poirot like a\r\nflash.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it you want?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot bowed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not think it is necessary to insult Miss Elsa Hardt\u2019s\r\nintelligence by telling her.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a swift movement, the woman snatched up a big black velvet\r\ncat which served as a cover for the telephone.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are stitched in the lining of that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cClever,\u201d murmured Poirot appreciatively. He stood aside from the\r\ndoor. \u201cGood evening, madame. I will detain your friend from New\r\nYork whilst you make your getaway.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhatta fool!\u201d roared the big Italian, and raising the revolver he\r\nfired point-blank at the woman\u2019s retreating figure just as I flung\r\nmyself upon him.\r\n\r\nBut the weapon merely clicked harmlessly and Poirot\u2019s voice rose\r\nin mild reproof.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever will you trust your old friend, Hastings. I do not care for\r\nmy friends to carry loaded pistols about with them and never would\r\nI permit a mere acquaintance to do so. No, no, _mon ami_.\u201d This to\r\nthe Italian who swearing hoarsely. Poirot continued to address him\r\nin a tone of mild reproof: \u201cSee now, what I have done for you. I\r\nhave saved you from being hanged. And do not think that our\r\nbeautiful lady will escape. No, no, the house is watched, back and\r\nfront. Straight into the arms of the police they will go. Is not\r\nthat a beautiful and consoling thought? Yes, you may leave the room\r\nnow. But be careful\u2014be very careful. I\u2014\u2014Ah, he is gone! And my\r\nfriend Hastings looks at me with eyes of reproach. But it was all\r\nso simple! It was clear, from the first, that out of several\r\nhundred, probably, applicants for No. 4, Montagu Mansions only the\r\nRobinsons were considered suitable. Why? What was there that\r\nsingled them out from the rest\u2014at practically a glance. Their\r\nappearance? Possibly, but it was not so unusual. Their name, then!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut there\u2019s nothing unusual about the name of Robinson,\u201d I cried.\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a common name.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! _Sapristi_, but exactly! That was the point. Elsa Hardt and\r\nher husband, or brother or whatever he really is, come from New\r\nYork, and take a flat in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson. Suddenly\r\nthey learn that one of these secret societies, the Mafia, or the\r\nCamorra, to which doubtless Luigi Valdarno belonged, is on their\r\ntrack. What do they do? They hit on a scheme of transparent\r\nsimplicity. Evidently they knew that their pursuers were not\r\npersonally acquainted with either of them. What then can be simpler?\r\nThey offer the flat at an absurdly low rental. Of the thousands of\r\nyoung couples in London looking for flats, there cannot fail to be\r\nseveral Robinsons. It is only a matter of waiting. If you will look\r\nat the name of Robinson in the telephone directory, you will\r\nrealize that a fair-haired Mrs. Robinson was pretty sure to come\r\nalong sooner or later. Then what will happen? The avenger arrives.\r\nHe knows the name, he knows the address. He strikes! All is over,\r\nvengeance is satisfied, and Miss Elsa Hardt has escaped by the skin\r\nof her teeth once more. By the way, Hastings, you must present me\r\nto the real Mrs. Robinson\u2014that delightful and truthful creature!\r\nWhat will they think when they find their flat has been broken\r\ninto! We must hurry back. Ah, that sounds like Japp and his friends\r\narriving.\u201d\r\n\r\nA mighty tattoo sounded on the knocker.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you know this address?\u201d I asked as I followed Poirot out\r\ninto the hall. \u201cOh, of course, you had the first Mrs. Robinson\r\nfollowed when she left the other flat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_A la bonne heure_, Hastings. You use your grey cells at last.\r\nNow for a little surprise for Japp.\u201d\r\n\r\nSoftly unbolting the door, he stuck the cat\u2019s head round the edge\r\nand ejaculated a piercing \u201cMiaow.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Scotland Yard inspector, who was standing outside with another\r\nman, jumped in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s only Monsieur Poirot at one of his little jokes!\u201d he\r\nexclaimed, as Poirot\u2019s head followed that of the cat. \u201cLet us in,\r\nmoosior.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have our friends safe and sound?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, we\u2019ve got the birds all right. But they hadn\u2019t got the goods\r\nwith them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see. So you come to search. Well, I am about to depart with\r\nHastings, but I should like to give you a little lecture upon the\r\nhistory and habits of the domestic cat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor the Lord\u2019s sake, have you gone completely balmy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe cat,\u201d declaimed Poirot, \u201cwas worshipped by the ancient\r\nEgyptians. It is still regarded as a symbol of good luck if a black\r\ncat crosses your path. This cat crossed your path to-night, Japp.\r\nTo speak of the interior of any animal or any person is not, I\r\nknow, considered polite in England. But the interior of this cat\r\nis perfectly delicate. I refer to the lining.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a sudden grunt, the second man seized the cat from Poirot\u2019s\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, I forgot to introduce you,\u201d said Japp. \u201cMr. Poirot, this is\r\nMr. Burt of the United States Secret Service.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe American\u2019s trained fingers had felt what he was looking for.\r\nHe held out his hand, and for a moment speech failed him. Then he\r\nrose to the occasion.\r\n\r\n\u201cPleased to meet you,\u201d said Mr. Burt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  IV\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Mystery of Hunter\u2019s Lodge\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter all,\u201d murmured Poirot, \u201cit is possible that I shall not die\r\nthis time.\u201d\r\n\r\nComing from a convalescent influenza patient, I hailed the remark\r\nas showing a beneficial optimism. I myself had been the first\r\nsufferer from the disease. Poirot in his turn had gone down. He\r\nwas now sitting up in bed, propped up with pillows, his head\r\nmuffled in a woollen shawl, and was slowly sipping a particularly\r\nnoxious tisane which I had prepared according to his directions.\r\nHis eye rested with pleasure upon a neatly graduated row of medicine\r\nbottles which adorned the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d my little friend continued. \u201cOnce more shall I be\r\nmyself again, the great Hercule Poirot, the terror of evil-doers!\r\nFigure to yourself, _mon ami_, that I have a little paragraph to\r\nmyself in _Society Gossip_. But yes! Here it is! \u2018Go it\u2014criminals\u2014all\r\nout! Hercule Poirot\u2014and believe me, girls, he\u2019s some Hercules!\u2014our\r\nown pet society detective can\u2019t get a grip on you. \u2019Cause why?\r\n\u2019Cause he\u2019s got _la grippe_ himself\u2019!\u201d\r\n\r\nI laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood for you, Poirot. You are becoming quite a public character.\r\nAnd fortunately you haven\u2019t missed anything of particular interest\r\nduring this time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is true. The few cases I have had to decline did not fill me\r\nwith any regret.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur landlady stuck her head in at the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a gentleman downstairs. Says he must see Monsieur Poirot\r\nor you, Captain. Seeing as he was in a great to-do\u2014and with all\r\nthat quite the gentleman\u2014I brought up \u2019is card.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe handed me the bit of pasteboard. \u201cMr. Roger Havering,\u201d I read.\r\n\r\nPoirot motioned with his head towards the bookcase, and I obediently\r\npulled forth \u201cWho\u2019s Who.\u201d Poirot took it from me and scanned the\r\npages rapidly.\r\n\r\n\u201cSecond son of fifth Baron Windsor. Married 1913 Zoe, fourth\r\ndaughter of William Crabb.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m!\u201d I said. \u201cI rather fancy that\u2019s the girl who used to act at\r\nthe Frivolity\u2014only she called herself Zoe Carrisbrook. I remember\r\nshe married some young man about town just before the War.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould it interest you, Hastings, to go down and hear what our\r\nvisitor\u2019s particular little trouble is? Make him all my excuses.\u201d\r\n\r\nRoger Havering was a man of about forty, well set up and of smart\r\nappearance. His face, however, was haggard, and he was evidently\r\nlabouring under great agitation.\r\n\r\n\u201cCaptain Hastings? You are Monsieur Poirot\u2019s partner, I understand.\r\nIt is imperative that he should come with me to Derbyshire to-day.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s impossible,\u201d I replied. \u201cPoirot is ill in\r\nbed\u2014influenza.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis face fell.\r\n\r\n\u201cDear me, that is a great blow to me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe matter on which you want to consult him is serious?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy God, yes! My uncle, the best friend I have in the world, was\r\nfoully murdered last night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere in London?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, in Derbyshire. I was in town and received a telegram from my\r\nwife this morning. Immediately upon its receipt I determined to\r\ncome round and beg Monsieur Poirot to undertake the case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you will excuse me a minute,\u201d I said, struck by a sudden idea.\r\n\r\nI rushed upstairs, and in a few brief words acquainted Poirot with\r\nthe situation. He took any further words out of my mouth.\r\n\r\n\u201cI see. I see. You want to go yourself, is it not so? Well, why\r\nnot? You should know my methods by now. All I ask is that you\r\nshould report to me fully every day, and follow implicitly any\r\ninstructions I may wire you.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo this I willingly agreed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022\r\n\r\n\r\nAn hour later I was sitting opposite Mr. Havering in a first-class\r\ncarriage on the Midland Railway, speeding rapidly away from London.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo begin with, Captain Hastings, you must understand that Hunter\u2019s\r\nLodge, where we are going, and where the tragedy took place, is\r\nonly a small shooting-box in the heart of the Derbyshire moors.\r\nOur real home is near Newmarket, and we usually rent a flat in town\r\nfor the season. Hunter\u2019s Lodge is looked after by a housekeeper\r\nwho is quite capable of doing all we need when we run down for an\r\noccasional week-end. Of course, during the shooting season, we take\r\ndown some of our own servants from Newmarket. My uncle, Mr.\r\nHarrington Pace (as you may know, my mother was a Miss Pace of New\r\nYork), has, for the last three years, made his home with us. He\r\nnever got on well with my father, or my elder brother, and I\r\nsuspect that my being somewhat of a prodigal son myself rather\r\nincreased than diminished his affection towards me. Of course I am\r\na poor man, and my uncle was a rich one\u2014in other words, he paid\r\nthe piper! But, though exacting in many ways, he was not really\r\nhard to get on with, and we all three lived very harmoniously\r\ntogether. Two days ago my uncle, rather wearied with some recent\r\ngaieties of ours in town, suggested that we should run down to\r\nDerbyshire for a day or two. My wife telegraphed to Mrs. Middleton,\r\nthe housekeeper, and we went down that same afternoon. Yesterday\r\nevening I was forced to return to town, but my wife and my uncle\r\nremained on. This morning I received this telegram.\u201d He handed it\r\nover to me:\r\n\r\n\u201cCome at once uncle Harrington murdered last night bring good\r\ndetective if you can but do come\u2014Zoe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, as yet you know no details?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I suppose it will be in the evening papers. Without doubt the\r\npolice are in charge.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was about three o\u2019clock when we arrived at the little station\r\nof Elmer\u2019s Dale. From there a five-mile drive brought us to a small\r\ngrey stone building in the midst of the rugged moors.\r\n\r\n\u201cA lonely place,\u201d I observed with a shiver.\r\n\r\nHavering nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall try and get rid of it. I could never live here again.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe unlatched the gate and were walking up the narrow path to the\r\noak door when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us.\r\n\r\n\u201cJapp!\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\nThe Scotland Yard inspector grinned at me in a friendly fashion\r\nbefore addressing my companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Havering, I think? I\u2019ve been sent down from London to take\r\ncharge of this case, and I\u2019d like a word with you, if I may, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy wife\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen your good lady, sir\u2014and the housekeeper. I won\u2019t keep\r\nyou a moment, but I\u2019m anxious to get back to the village now that\r\nI\u2019ve seen all there is to see here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know nothing as yet as to what\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEx-actly,\u201d said Japp soothingly. \u201cBut there are just one or two\r\nlittle points I\u2019d like your opinion about all the same. Captain\r\nHastings here, he knows me, and he\u2019ll go on up to the house and\r\ntell them you\u2019re coming. What have you done with the little man,\r\nby the way, Captain Hastings?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s ill in bed with influenza.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs he now? I\u2019m sorry to hear that. Rather the case of the cart\r\nwithout the horse, your being here without him, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd on his rather ill-timed jest I went on to the house. I rang\r\nthe bell, as Japp had closed the door behind him. After some\r\nmoments it was opened to me by a middle-aged woman in black.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Havering will be here in a moment,\u201d I explained. \u201cHe has been\r\ndetained by the inspector. I have come down with him from London\r\nto look into the case. Perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred\r\nlast night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome inside, sir.\u201d She closed the door behind me, and we stood in\r\nthe dimly-lighted hall. \u201cIt was after dinner last night, sir, that\r\nthe man came. He asked to see Mr. Pace, sir, and, seeing that he\r\nspoke the same way, I thought it was an American gentleman friend\r\nof Mr. Pace\u2019s and I showed him into the gun-room, and then went to\r\ntell Mr. Pace. He wouldn\u2019t give any name, which, of course, was a\r\nbit odd, now I come to think of it. I told Mr. Pace, and he seemed\r\npuzzled like, but he said to the mistress: \u2018Excuse me, Zoe, while\r\nI just see what this fellow wants.\u2019 He went off to the gun-room,\r\nand I went back to the kitchen, but after a while I heard loud\r\nvoices, as if they were quarrelling, and I came out into the hall.\r\nAt the same time, the mistress she comes out too, and just then\r\nthere was a shot and then a dreadful silence. We both ran to the\r\ngun-room door, but it was locked and we had to go round to the\r\nwindow. It was open, and there inside was Mr. Pace, all shot and\r\nbleeding.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat became of the man?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe must have got away through the window, sir, before we got to\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Havering sent me to fetch the police. Five miles to walk it\r\nwas. They came back with me, and the constable he stayed all night,\r\nand this morning the police gentleman from London arrived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat was this man like who called to see Mr. Pace?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper reflected.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe had a black beard, sir, and was about middle-aged, and had on\r\na light overcoat. Beyond the fact that he spoke like an American\r\nI didn\u2019t notice much about him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see. Now I wonder if I can see Mrs. Havering?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s upstairs, sir. Shall I tell her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you please. Tell her that Mr. Havering is outside with Inspector\r\nJapp, and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from\r\nLondon is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery good, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts. Japp had\r\ntwo or three hours\u2019 start of me, and his anxiety to be gone made\r\nme keen to be close at his heels.\r\n\r\nMrs. Havering did not keep me waiting long. In a few minutes I\r\nheard a light step descending the stairs, and looked up to see a\r\nvery handsome young woman coming towards me. She wore a\r\nflame-coloured jumper, that set off the slender boyishness of her\r\nfigure. On her dark head was a little hat of flame-coloured leather.\r\nEven the present tragedy could not dim the vitality of her\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\nI introduced myself, and she nodded in quick comprehension.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I have often heard of you and your colleague, Monsieur\r\nPoirot. You have done some wonderful things together, haven\u2019t you?\r\nIt was very clever of my husband to get you so promptly. Now will\r\nyou ask me questions? That is the easiest way, isn\u2019t it, of getting\r\nto know all you want to about this dreadful affair?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Mrs. Havering. Now what time was it that this man\r\narrived?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt must have been just before nine o\u2019clock. We had finished\r\ndinner, and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour husband had already left for London?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he went up by the 6.15.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid he go by car to the station, or did he walk?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOur own car isn\u2019t down here. One came out from the garage in\r\nElmer\u2019s Dale to fetch him in time for the train.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas Mr. Pace quite his usual self?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely. Most normal in every way.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, can you describe this visitor at all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not. I didn\u2019t see him. Mrs. Middleton showed him\r\nstraight into the gun-room and then came to tell my uncle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did your uncle say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe seemed rather annoyed, but went off at once. It was about five\r\nminutes later that I heard the sound of raised voices. I ran out\r\ninto the hall and almost collided with Mrs. Middleton. Then we\r\nheard the shot. The gun-room door was locked on the inside, and we\r\nhad to go right round the house to the window. Of course that took\r\nsome time, and the murderer had been able to get well away. My poor\r\nuncle\u201d\u2014her voice faltered\u2014\u201chad been shot through the head. I saw\r\nat once that he was dead. I sent Mrs. Middleton for the police. I\r\nwas careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly\r\nas I found it.\u201d\r\n\r\nI nodded approval.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, as to the weapon?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I can make a guess at it, Captain Hastings. A pair of\r\nrevolvers of my husband\u2019s were mounted upon the wall. One of them\r\nis missing. I pointed this out to the police, and they took the\r\nother one away with them. When they have extracted the bullet, I\r\nsuppose they will know for certain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMay I go to the gun-room?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. The police have finished with it. But the body has been\r\nremoved.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe accompanied me to the scene of the crime. At that moment Havering\r\nentered the hall, and with a quick apology his wife ran to him. I\r\nwas left to undertake my investigations alone.\r\n\r\nI may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing.\r\nIn detective novels clues abound, but here I could find nothing\r\nthat struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on\r\nthe carpet where I judged the dead man had fallen. I examined\r\neverything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of\r\nthe room with my little camera which I had brought with me. I also\r\nexamined the ground outside the window, but it appeared to have\r\nbeen so heavily trampled underfoot that I judged it was useless to\r\nwaste time over it. No, I had seen all that Hunter\u2019s Lodge had to\r\nshow me. I must go back to Elmer\u2019s Dale and get into touch with\r\nJapp. Accordingly I took leave of the Haverings, and was driven\r\noff in the car that had brought us up from the station.\r\n\r\nI found Japp at the Matlock Arms and he took me forthwith to see\r\nthe body. Harrington Pace was a small, spare clean-shaven man,\r\ntypically American in appearance. He had been shot through the back\r\nof the head, and the revolver had been discharged at close quarters.\r\n\r\n\u201cTurned away for a moment,\u201d remarked Japp, \u201cand the other fellow\r\nsnatched up a revolver and shot him. The one Mrs. Havering handed\r\nover to us was fully loaded and I suppose the other one was also.\r\nCurious what darn fool things people do. Fancy keeping two loaded\r\nrevolvers hanging up on your wall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think of the case?\u201d I asked, as we left the gruesome\r\nchamber behind us.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d got my eye on Havering to begin with. Oh, yes!\u201d noting\r\nmy exclamation of astonishment. \u201cHavering has one or two shady\r\nincidents in his past. When he was a boy at Oxford there was some\r\nfunny business about the signature on one of his father\u2019s cheques.\r\nAll hushed up of course. Then, he\u2019s pretty heavily in debt now,\r\nand they\u2019re the kind of debts he wouldn\u2019t like to go to his uncle\r\nabout, whereas you may be sure the uncle\u2019s will would be in his\r\nfavour. Yes, I\u2019d got my eye on him, and that\u2019s why I wanted to\r\nspeak to him before he saw his wife, but their statements dovetail\r\nall right, and I\u2019ve been to the station and there\u2019s no doubt\r\nwhatever that he left by the 6.15. That gets up to London about\r\n10.30. He went straight to his club, he says, and if that\u2019s\r\nconfirmed all right\u2014why, he couldn\u2019t have been shooting his uncle\r\nhere at nine o\u2019clock in a black beard!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes, I was going to ask you what you thought about that\r\nbeard?\u201d\r\n\r\nJapp winked.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it grew pretty fast\u2014grew in the five miles from Elmer\u2019s\r\nDale to Hunter\u2019s Lodge. Americans that I\u2019ve met are mostly\r\nclean-shaven. Yes, it\u2019s amongst Mr. Pace\u2019s American associates that\r\nwe\u2019ll have to look for the murderer. I questioned the housekeeper\r\nfirst, and then her mistress, and their stories agree all right,\r\nbut I\u2019m sorry Mrs. Havering didn\u2019t get a look at the fellow. She\u2019s\r\na smart woman, and she might have noticed something that would set\r\nus on the track.\u201d\r\n\r\nI sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to Poirot. I was\r\nable to add various further items of information before I posted\r\nthe letter.\r\n\r\nThe bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired\r\nfrom a revolver identical with the one held by the police.\r\nFurthermore, Mr. Havering\u2019s movements on the night in question had\r\nbeen checked and verified, and it was proved beyond doubt that he\r\nhad actually arrived in London by the train in question. And,\r\nthirdly, a sensational development had occurred. A city gentleman,\r\nliving at Ealing, on crossing Haven Green to get to the District\r\nRailway Station that morning, had observed a brown-paper parcel\r\nstuck between the railings. Opening it, he found that it contained\r\na revolver. He handed the parcel over to the local police station,\r\nand before night it was proved to be the one we were in search of,\r\nthe fellow to that given us by Mrs. Havering. One bullet had been\r\nfired from it.\r\n\r\nAll this I added to my report. A wire from Poirot arrived whilst\r\nI was at breakfast the following morning:\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course black bearded man was not Havering only you or Japp\r\nwould have such an idea wire me description of housekeeper and what\r\nclothes she wore this morning same of Mrs. Havering do not waste\r\ntime taking photographs of interiors they are underexposed and not\r\nin the least artistic.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that Poirot\u2019s style was unnecessarily facetious.\r\nI also fancied he was a shade jealous of my position on the spot\r\nwith full facilities for handling the case. His request for a\r\ndescription of the clothes worn by the two women appeared to me to\r\nbe simply ridiculous, but I complied as well as I, a mere man, was\r\nable to.\r\n\r\nAt eleven a reply wire came from Poirot:\r\n\r\n\u201cAdvise Japp arrest housekeeper before it is too late.\u201d\r\n\r\nDumbfounded, I took the wire to Japp. He swore softly under his\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s the goods, Monsieur Poirot! If he says so, there\u2019s something\r\nin it. And I hardly noticed the woman. I don\u2019t know that I can go\r\nso far as arresting her, but I\u2019ll have her watched. We\u2019ll go up\r\nright away, and take another look at her.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut it was too late. Mrs. Middleton, that quiet middle-aged woman,\r\nwho had appeared so normal and respectable, had vanished into thin\r\nair. Her box had been left behind. It contained only ordinary\r\nwearing apparel. There was no clue in it to her identity, or as to\r\nher whereabouts.\r\n\r\nFrom Mrs. Havering we elicited all the facts we could:\r\n\r\n\u201cI engaged her about three weeks ago when Mrs. Emery, our former\r\nhousekeeper, left. She came to me from Mrs. Selbourne\u2019s Agency in\r\nMount Street\u2014a very well-known place. I get all my servants from\r\nthere. They sent several women to see me, but this Mrs. Middleton\r\nseemed much the nicest, and had splendid references. I engaged her\r\non the spot, and notified the Agency of the fact. I can\u2019t believe\r\nthat there was anything wrong with her. She was such a nice quiet\r\nwoman.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe thing was certainly a mystery. Whilst it was clear that the\r\nwoman herself could not have committed the crime, since at the\r\nmoment the shot was fired Mrs. Havering was with her in the hall,\r\nnevertheless she must have some connection with the murder, or why\r\nshould she suddenly take to her heels and bolt?\r\n\r\nI wired the latest development to Poirot and suggested returning\r\nto London and making inquiries at Selbourne\u2019s Agency.\r\n\r\nPoirot\u2019s reply was prompt:\r\n\r\n\u201cUseless to inquire at agency they will never have heard of her\r\nfind out what vehicle took her up to hunters lodge when she first\r\narrived there.\u201d\r\n\r\nThough mystified, I was obedient. The means of transport in Elmer\u2019s\r\nDale were limited. The local garage had two battered Ford cars,\r\nand there were two station flies. None of these had been\r\nrequisitioned on the date in question. Questioned, Mrs. Havering\r\nexplained that she had given the woman the money for her fare down\r\nto Derbyshire and sufficient to hire a car or fly to take her up\r\nto Hunter\u2019s Lodge. There was usually one of the Fords at the\r\nstation on the chance of its being required. Taking into\r\nconsideration the further fact that nobody at the station had\r\nnoticed the arrival of a stranger, black-bearded or otherwise, on\r\nthe fatal evening, everything seemed to point to the conclusion\r\nthat the murderer had come to the spot in a car, which had been\r\nwaiting near at hand to aid his escape, and that the same car had\r\nbrought the mysterious housekeeper to her new post. I may mention\r\nthat inquiries at the Agency in London bore out Poirot\u2019s\r\nprognostication. No such woman as \u201cMrs. Middleton\u201d had ever been\r\non their books. They had received the Hon. Mrs. Havering\u2019s\r\napplication for a housekeeper, and had sent her various applicants\r\nfor the post. When she sent them the engagement fee, she omitted\r\nto mention which woman she had selected.\r\n\r\nSomewhat crestfallen, I returned to London. I found Poirot\r\nestablished in an arm-chair by the fire in a garish, silk\r\ndressing-gown. He greeted me with much affection.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon ami_ Hastings! But how glad I am to see you. Veritably I have\r\nfor you a great affection. And you have enjoyed yourself? You have\r\nrun to and fro with the good Japp? You have interrogated and\r\ninvestigated to your heart\u2019s content?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I cried, \u201cthe thing\u2019s a dark mystery! It will never be\r\nsolved.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory\r\nover it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed. It\u2019s a hard nut to crack.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, as far as that goes, I am very good at cracking the nuts! A\r\nveritable squirrel! It is not that which embarrasses me. I know\r\nwell enough who killed Mr. Harrington Pace.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know? How did you find out?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth.\r\nSee here, Hastings, let us examine the facts methodically and in\r\norder. Mr. Harrington Pace is a man with a considerable fortune\r\nwhich at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew. Point No. 1.\r\nHis nephew is known to be desperately hard up. Point No. 2. His\r\nnephew is also known to be\u2014shall we say a man of rather loose\r\nmoral fibre? Point No. 3.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Roger Havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to\r\nLondon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment_\u2014and therefore, as Mr. Havering left Elmer\u2019s Dale at\r\n6.15, and since Mr. Pace cannot have been killed before he left,\r\nor the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being\r\ngiven wrongly when he examined the body, we conclude quite rightly,\r\nthat Mr. Havering did not shoot his uncle. But there is a Mrs.\r\nHavering, Hastings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cImpossible! The housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, yes, the housekeeper. But she has disappeared.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe will be found.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think not. There is something peculiarly elusive about that\r\nhousekeeper, don\u2019t you think so, Hastings? It struck me at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe played her part, I suppose, and then got out in the nick of\r\ntime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what was her part?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, presumably to admit her confederate, the black-bearded man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, no, that was not her part! Her part was what you have just\r\nmentioned, to provide an alibi for Mrs. Havering at the moment the\r\nshot was fired. And no one will ever find her, _mon ami_, because\r\nshe does not exist! \u2018There\u2019s no sech person,\u2019 as your so great\r\nShakespeare says.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was Dickens,\u201d I murmured, unable to suppress a smile. \u201cBut what\r\ndo you mean, Poirot?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI mean that Zoe Havering was an actress before her marriage, that\r\nyou and Japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim\r\nmiddle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice, and finally\r\nthat neither you nor Japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper\r\nfetched, ever saw Mrs. Middleton and her mistress at one and the\r\nsame time. It was child\u2019s play for that clever and daring woman.\r\nOn the pretext of summoning her mistress, she runs upstairs, slips\r\non a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she\r\njams down over the grey transformation. A few deft touches, and\r\nthe make-up is removed, a slight dusting of rouge, and the brilliant\r\nZoe Havering comes down with her clear ringing voice. Nobody looks\r\nparticularly at the housekeeper. Why should they? There is nothing\r\nto connect her with the crime. She, too, has an alibi.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the revolver that was found at Ealing? Mrs. Havering could\r\nnot have placed it there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, that was Roger Havering\u2019s job\u2014but it was a mistake on their\r\npart. It put me on the right track. A man who has committed a\r\nmurder with a revolver which he found on the spot would fling it\r\naway at once, he would not carry it up to London with him. No, the\r\nmotive was clear, the criminals wished to focus the interest of\r\nthe police on a spot far removed from Derbyshire they were anxious\r\nto get the police away as soon as possible from the vicinity of\r\nHunter\u2019s Lodge. Of course the revolver found at Ealing was not the\r\none with which Mr. Pace was shot. Roger Havering discharged one\r\nshot from it, brought it up to London, went straight to his club\r\nto establish his alibi, then went quickly out to Ealing by the\r\ndistrict, a matter of about twenty minutes only, placed the parcel\r\nwhere it was found and so back to town. That charming creature,\r\nhis wife, quietly shoots Mr. Pace after dinner\u2014you remember he was\r\nshot from behind? Another significant point, that!\u2014reloads the\r\nrevolver and puts it back in its place, and then starts off with\r\nher desperate little comedy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d I murmured, fascinated, \u201cand yet\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet it is true. _Bien sur_, my friend, it is true. But to\r\nbring that precious pair to justice, that is another matter. Well,\r\nJapp must do what he can\u2014I have written him fully\u2014but I very much\r\nfear, Hastings, that we shall be obliged to leave them to Fate, or\r\n_le bon Dieu_, whichever you prefer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe wicked flourish like a green bay tree,\u201d I reminded him.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut at a price, Hastings, always at a price, _croyez-moi!_\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot\u2019s forebodings were confirmed. Japp, though convinced of the\r\ntruth of his theory, was unable to get together the necessary\r\nevidence to ensure a conviction.\r\n\r\nMr. Pace\u2019s huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers.\r\nNevertheless, Nemesis did overtake them, and when I read in the\r\npaper that the Hon. Roger and Mrs. Havering were amongst those\r\nkilled in the crashing of the Air Mail to Paris I knew that Justice\r\nwas satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  V\r\n\r\n  The Million Dollar Bond Robbery\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat a number of bond robberies there have been lately!\u201d I observed\r\none morning, laying aside the newspaper. \u201cPoirot, let us forsake\r\nthe science of detection, and take to crime instead!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are on the\u2014how do you say it?\u2014get-rich-quick tack, eh, _mon\r\nami_?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, look at this last _coup_, the million dollars\u2019 worth of\r\nLiberty Bonds which the London and Scottish Bank were sending to\r\nNew York, and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on\r\nboard the _Olympia_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf it were not for the _mal de mer_, and the difficulty of\r\npractising the so excellent method of Laverguier for a longer time\r\nthan the few hours of crossing the channel, I should delight to\r\nvoyage myself on one of these big liners,\u201d murmured Poirot dreamily.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d I said enthusiastically. \u201cSome of them must be\r\nperfect palaces; the swimming-baths, the lounges, the restaurant,\r\nthe palm courts\u2014really, it must be hard to believe that one is on\r\nthe sea.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMe, I always know when I am on the sea,\u201d said Poirot sadly. \u201cAnd\r\nall those bagatelles that you enumerate, they say nothing to me;\r\nbut, my friend, consider for a moment the geniuses that travel as\r\nit were incognito! On board these floating palaces, as you so\r\njustly call them, one would meet the \u00e9lite, the _haute noblesse_\r\nof the criminal world!\u201d\r\n\r\nI laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s the way your enthusiasm runs! You would have liked to\r\ncross swords with the man who sneaked the Liberty Bonds?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe landlady interrupted us.\r\n\r\n\u201cA young lady as wants to see you, Mr. Poirot. Here\u2019s her card.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe card bore the inscription: Miss Esm\u00e9e Farquhar, and Poirot,\r\nafter diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb, and putting\r\nit carefully in the waste-paper-basket, nodded to the landlady to\r\nadmit her.\r\n\r\nIn another minute one of the most charming girls I have ever seen\r\nwas ushered into the room. She was perhaps about five-and-twenty,\r\nwith big brown eyes and a perfect figure. She was well-dressed and\r\nperfectly composed in manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cSit down, I beg of you, mademoiselle. This is my friend, Captain\r\nHastings, who aids me in my little problems.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am afraid it is a big problem I have brought you to-day, Monsieur\r\nPoirot,\u201d said the girl, giving me a pleasant bow as she seated\r\nherself. \u201cI dare say you have read about it in the papers. I am\r\nreferring to the theft of Liberty Bonds on the _Olympia_.\u201d Some\r\nastonishment must have shown itself in Poirot\u2019s face, for she\r\ncontinued quickly: \u201cYou are doubtless asking yourself what I have\r\nto do with a grave institution like the London and Scottish Bank.\r\nIn one sense nothing, in another sense everything. You see, Monsieur\r\nPoirot, I am engaged to Mr. Philip Ridgeway.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAha! and Mr. Philip Ridgeway\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas in charge of the bonds when they were stolen. Of course no\r\nactual blame can attach to him, it was not his fault in any way.\r\nNevertheless, he is half distraught over the matter, and his uncle,\r\nI know, insists that he must carelessly have mentioned having them\r\nin his possession. It is a terrible set-back in his career.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho is his uncle?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Vavasour, joint general manager of the London and Scottish\r\nBank.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose, Miss Farquhar, that you recount to me the whole story?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery well. As you know, the Bank wished to extend their credits\r\nin America, and for this purpose decided to send over a million\r\ndollars in Liberty Bonds. Mr. Vavasour selected his nephew, who\r\nhad occupied a position of trust in the Bank for many years and\r\nwho was conversant with all the details of the Bank\u2019s dealings in\r\nNew York, to make the trip. The Olympia sailed from Liverpool on\r\nthe 23rd, and the bonds were handed over to Philip on the morning\r\nof that day by Mr. Vavasour and Mr. Shaw, the two joint general\r\nmanagers of the London and Scottish Bank. They were counted,\r\nenclosed in a package, and sealed in his presence, and he then\r\nlocked the package at once in his portmanteau.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA portmanteau with an ordinary lock?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, Mr. Shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by\r\nHubbs\u2019s. Philip, as I say, placed the package at the bottom of the\r\ntrunk. It was stolen just a few hours before reaching New York. A\r\nrigorous search of the whole ship was made, but without result.\r\nThe bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin air.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot made a grimace.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut they did not vanish absolutely, since I gather that they were\r\nsold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking of the\r\n_Olympia_! Well, undoubtedly the next thing is for me to see Mr.\r\nRidgeway.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the\r\n\u2018Cheshire Cheese.\u2019 Philip will be there. He is meeting me, but does\r\nnot yet know that I have been consulting you on his behalf.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe agreed to this suggestion readily enough, and drove there in a\r\ntaxi.\r\n\r\nMr. Philip Ridgeway was there before us, and looked somewhat\r\nsurprised to see his fianc\u00e9e arriving with two complete strangers.\r\nHe was a nice-looking young fellow, tall and spruce, with a touch\r\nof greying hair at the temples, though he could not have been much\r\nover thirty.\r\n\r\nMiss Farquhar went up to him and laid her hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must forgive my acting without consulting you, Philip,\u201d she\r\nsaid. \u201cLet me introduce you to Monsieur Hercule Poirot, of whom\r\nyou must often have heard, and his friend, Captain Hastings.\u201d\r\n\r\nRidgeway looked very astonished.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course I have heard of you, Monsieur Poirot,\u201d he said, as he\r\nshook hands. \u201cBut I had no idea that Esm\u00e9e was thinking of\r\nconsulting you about my\u2014our trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was afraid you would not let me do it, Philip,\u201d said Miss\r\nFarquhar meekly.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you took care to be on the safe side,\u201d he observed, with a\r\nsmile. \u201cI hope Monsieur Poirot will be able to throw some light on\r\nthis extraordinary puzzle, for I confess frankly that I am nearly\r\nout of my mind with worry and anxiety about it.\u201d\r\n\r\nIndeed, his face looked drawn and haggard and showed only too\r\nclearly the strain under which he was labouring.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said Poirot. \u201cLet us lunch, and over lunch we will\r\nput our heads together and see what can be done. I want to hear\r\nMr. Ridgeway\u2019s story from his own lips.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the\r\nestablishment, Philip Ridgeway narrated the circumstances leading\r\nto the disappearance of the bonds. His story agreed with that of\r\nMiss Farquhar in every particular. When he had finished, Poirot\r\ntook up the thread with a question.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat exactly led you to discover that the bonds had been stolen,\r\nMr. Ridgeway?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe laughed rather bitterly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe thing stared me in the face, Monsieur Poirot. I couldn\u2019t have\r\nmissed it. My cabin trunk was half out from under the bunk and all\r\nscratched and cut about where they\u2019d tried to force the lock.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut I understood that it had been opened with a key?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so. They tried to force it, but couldn\u2019t. And, in the end,\r\nthey must have got it unlocked somehow or other.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCurious,\u201d said Poirot, his eyes beginning to flicker with the\r\ngreen light I knew so well. \u201cVery curious! They waste much, much\r\ntime trying to prise it open, and then\u2014_sapristi!_ they find that\r\nthey have the key all the time\u2014for each of Hubbs\u2019s locks are\r\nunique.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just why they couldn\u2019t have had the key. It never left me\r\nday or night.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure of that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can swear to it, and besides, if they had had the key or a\r\nduplicate, why should they waste time trying to force an obviously\r\nunforceable lock?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh! there is exactly the question we are asking ourselves! I\r\nventure to prophesy that the solution, if we ever find it, will\r\nhinge on that curious fact. I beg of you not to assault me if I\r\nask you one more question: _Are you perfectly certain you did not\r\nleave the trunk unlocked?_\u201d\r\n\r\nPhilip Ridgeway merely looked at him, and Poirot gesticulated\r\napologetically.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, but these things can happen, I assure you! Very well, the\r\nbonds were stolen from the trunk. What did the thief do with them?\r\nHow did he manage to get ashore with them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d cried Ridgeway. \u201cThat\u2019s just it. How? Word was passed to the\r\nCustoms authorities, and every soul that left the ship was gone\r\nover with a toothcomb!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the bonds, I gather, made a bulky package?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly they did. They could hardly have been hidden on board\u2014and\r\nanyway we know they weren\u2019t because they were offered for sale\r\nwithin half an hour of the _Olympia\u2019s_ arrival, long before I got\r\nthe cables going and the numbers sent out. One broker swears he\r\nbought some of them even before the _Olympia_ got in. But you can\u2019t\r\nsend bonds by wireless.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot by wireless, but did any tug come alongside?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly the official ones, and that was after the alarm was given\r\nwhen every one was on the look-out. I was watching out myself for\r\ntheir being passed over to some one that way. My God, Monsieur\r\nPoirot, this thing will drive me mad! People are beginning to say\r\nI stole them myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you also were searched on landing, weren\u2019t you?\u201d asked Poirot\r\ngently.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young man stared at him in a puzzled manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not catch my meaning, I see,\u201d said Poirot, smiling\r\nenigmatically. \u201cNow I should like to make a few inquiries at the\r\nBank.\u201d\r\n\r\nRidgeway produced a card and scribbled a few words on it.\r\n\r\n\u201cSend this in and my uncle will see you at once.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot thanked him, bade farewell to Miss Farquhar, and together\r\nwe started out for Threadneedle Street and the head office of the\r\nLondon and Scottish Bank. On production of Ridgeway\u2019s card, we were\r\nled through the labyrinth of counters and desks, skirting paying-in\r\nclerks and paying-out clerks and up to a small office on the first\r\nfloor where the joint general managers received us. They were two\r\ngrave gentlemen, who had grown grey in the service of the Bank.\r\nMr. Vavasour had a short white beard, Mr. Shaw was clean shaven.\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand you are strictly a private inquiry agent?\u201d said Mr.\r\nVavasour. \u201cQuite so, quite so. We have, of course, placed ourselves\r\nin the hands of Scotland Yard. Inspector McNeil has charge of the\r\ncase. A very able officer, I believe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure of it,\u201d said Poirot politely. \u201cYou will permit a few\r\nquestions, on your nephew\u2019s behalf? About this lock, who ordered\r\nit from Hubbs\u2019s?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI ordered it myself,\u201d said Mr. Shaw. \u201cI would not trust to any\r\nclerk in the matter. As to the keys, Mr. Ridgeway had one, and the\r\nother two are held by my colleague and myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd no clerk has had access to them?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Shaw turned inquiringly to Mr. Vavasour. \u201cI think I am correct\r\nin saying that they have remained in the safe where we placed them\r\non the 23rd,\u201d said Mr. Vavasour. \u201cMy colleague was unfortunately\r\ntaken ill a fortnight ago\u2014in fact on the very day that Philip left\r\nus. He has only just recovered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSevere bronchitis is no joke to a man of my age,\u201d said Mr. Shaw\r\nruefully. \u201cBut I am afraid Mr. Vavasour has suffered from the hard\r\nwork entailed by my absence, especially with this unexpected worry\r\ncoming on top of everything.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot asked a few more questions. I judged that he was endeavouring\r\nto gauge the exact amount of intimacy between uncle and nephew.\r\nMr. Vavasour\u2019s answers were brief and punctilious. His nephew was\r\na trusted official of the Bank, and had no debts or money\r\ndifficulties that he knew of. He had been entrusted with similar\r\nmissions in the past. Finally we were politely bowed out.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am disappointed,\u201d said Poirot, as we emerged into the street.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou hoped to discover more? They are such stodgy old men.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not their stodginess which disappoints me, _mon ami_. I do\r\nnot expect to find in a Bank manager a \u2018keen financier with an\r\neagle glance\u2019 as your favourite works of fiction put it. No, I am\r\ndisappointed in the case\u2014it is too easy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEasy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, do you not find it almost childishly simple?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know who stole the bonds?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut then\u2014we must\u2014why\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not confuse and fluster yourself, Hastings. We are not going\r\nto do anything at present.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why? What are you waiting for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor the _Olympia_. She is due on her return trip from New York on\r\nTuesday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut if you know who stole the bonds, why wait? He may escape.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo a South Sea island where there is no extradition? No, _mon\r\nami_, he would find life very uncongenial there. As to why I\r\nwait\u2014_eh bien_ to the intelligence of Hercule Poirot the case is\r\nperfectly clear, but for the benefit of others, not so greatly\r\ngifted by the good God\u2014the Inspector McNeil, for instance\u2014it would\r\nbe as well to make a few inquiries to establish the facts. One must\r\nhave consideration for those less gifted than oneself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood Lord, Poirot! Do you know, I\u2019d give a considerable sum of\r\nmoney to see you make a thorough ass of yourself\u2014just for once.\r\nYou\u2019re so confoundedly conceited!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not enrage yourself, Hastings. In verity, I observe that there\r\nare times when you almost detest me! Alas, I suffer the penalties\r\nof greatness!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe little man puffed out his chest, and sighed so comically that\r\nI was forced to laugh.\r\n\r\nTuesday saw us speeding to Liverpool in a first-class carriage of\r\nthe L. & N.W.R. Poirot had obstinately refused to enlighten me as\r\nto his suspicions\u2014or certainties. He contented himself with\r\nexpressing surprise that I, too, was not equally _au fait_ with\r\nthe situation. I disdained to argue, and entrenched my curiosity\r\nbehind a rampart of pretended indifference.\r\n\r\nOnce arrived at the quay alongside which lay the big transatlantic\r\nliner, Poirot became brisk and alert. Our proceedings consisted in\r\ninterviewing four successive stewards and inquiring after a friend\r\nof Poirot\u2019s who had crossed to New York on the 23rd.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn elderly gentleman, wearing glasses. A great invalid, hardly\r\nmoved out of his cabin.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe description appeared to tally with one Mr. Ventnor who had\r\noccupied the cabin C 24 which was next to that of Philip Ridgeway.\r\nAlthough unable to see how Poirot had deduced Mr. Ventnor\u2019s\r\nexistence and personal appearance, I was keenly excited.\r\n\r\n\u201cTell me,\u201d I cried, \u201cwas this gentleman one of the first to land\r\nwhen you got to New York?\u201d The steward shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed, sir, he was one of the last off the boat.\u201d\r\n\r\nI retired crestfallen, and observed Poirot grinning at me. He\r\nthanked the steward, a note changed hands, and we took our\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very well,\u201d I remarked heatedly, \u201cbut that last answer\r\nmust have damped your precious theory, grin as you please!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs usual, you see nothing, Hastings. That last answer is, on the\r\ncontrary, the coping-stone of my theory.\u201d\r\n\r\nI flung up my hands in despair.\r\n\r\n\u201cI give it up.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n  \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we were in the train, speeding towards London, Poirot wrote\r\nbusily for a few minutes, sealing up the result in an envelope.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is for the good Inspector McNeil. We will leave it at Scotland\r\nYard in passing, and then to the Rendezvous Restaurant, where I\r\nhave asked Miss Esm\u00e9e Farquhar to do us the honour of dining with\r\nus.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about Ridgeway?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d asked Poirot with a twinkle.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you surely don\u2019t think\u2014you can\u2019t\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe habit of incoherence is growing upon you, Hastings. As a\r\nmatter of fact I _did_ think. If Ridgeway had been the thief\u2014which\r\nwas perfectly possible\u2014the case would have been charming; a piece\r\nof neat methodical work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut not so charming for Miss Farquhar.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPossibly you are right. Therefore all is for the best. Now,\r\nHastings, let us review the case. I can see that you are dying to\r\ndo so. The sealed package is removed from the trunk and vanishes,\r\nas Miss Farquhar puts it, into thin air. We will dismiss the thin\r\nair theory, which is not practicable at the present stage of\r\nscience, and consider what is likely to have become of it. Every\r\none asserts the incredibility of its being smuggled ashore\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but we know\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_You_ may know, Hastings. I do not. I take the view that, since\r\nit seemed incredible, it _was_ incredible. Two possibilities\r\nremain: it was hidden on board\u2014also rather difficult\u2014or it was\r\nthrown overboard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith a cork on it, do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout a cork.\u201d\r\n\r\nI stared.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut if the bonds were thrown overboard, they couldn\u2019t have been\r\nsold in New York.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI admire your logical mind, Hastings. The bonds were sold in New\r\nYork, therefore they were not thrown overboard. You see where that\r\nleads us?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere we were when we started.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Jamais de la vie!_ If the package was thrown overboard, and the\r\nbonds were sold in New York, the package could not have contained\r\nthe bonds. Is there any evidence that the package _did_ contain\r\nthe bonds? Remember, Mr. Ridgeway never opened it from the time it\r\nwas placed in his hands in London.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but then\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot waved an impatient hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cPermit me to continue. The last moment that the bonds are seen as\r\nbonds is in the office of the London and Scottish Bank on the\r\nmorning of the 23rd. They reappear in New York half an hour after\r\nthe _Olympia_ gets in, and according to one man, whom nobody\r\nlistens to, actually _before_ she gets in. Supposing then, that\r\nthey have never been on the _Olympia_ at all? Is there any other\r\nway they could get to New York? Yes. The _Gigantic_ leaves\r\nSouthampton on the same day as the _Olympia_, and she holds the\r\nrecord for the Atlantic. Mailed by the _Gigantic_, the bonds would\r\nbe in New York the day before the _Olympia_ arrived. All is clear,\r\nthe case begins to explain itself. The sealed packet is only a\r\ndummy, and the moment of its substitution must be in the office in\r\nthe Bank. It would be an easy matter for any of the three men\r\npresent to have prepared a duplicate package which could be\r\nsubstituted for the genuine one. _Tr\u00e8s bien_, the bonds are mailed\r\nto a confederate in New York, with instructions to sell as soon as\r\nthe _Olympia_ is in, but some one must travel on the _Olympia_ to\r\nengineer the supposed moment of the robbery.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause if Ridgeway merely opens the packet and finds it a dummy,\r\nsuspicion flies at once to London. No, the man on board in the\r\ncabin next door does his work, pretends to force the lock in an\r\nobvious manner so as to draw immediate attention to the theft,\r\nreally unlocks the trunk with a duplicate key, throws the package\r\noverboard and waits until the last to leave the boat. Naturally he\r\nwears glasses to conceal his eyes, and is an invalid since he does\r\nnot want to run the risk of meeting Ridgeway. He steps ashore in\r\nNew York and returns by the first boat available.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut who\u2014which was he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man who had a duplicate key, the man who ordered the lock,\r\nthe man who has _not_ been severely ill with bronchitis at his home\r\nin the country\u2014_enfin_, that \u2018stodgy\u2019 old man, Mr. Shaw! There are\r\ncriminals in high places sometimes, my friend. Ah, here we are.\r\nMademoiselle, I have succeeded! You permit?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd, beaming, Poirot kissed the astonished girl lightly on either\r\ncheek!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  VI\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Adventure of the Egyptian Tomb\r\n\r\n\r\nI have always considered that one of the most thrilling and dramatic\r\nof the many adventures I have shared with Poirot was that of our\r\ninvestigation into the strange series of deaths which followed upon\r\nthe discovery and opening of the Tomb of King Men-her-Ra.\r\n\r\nHard upon the discovery of the Tomb of Tut-ankh-Amen by Lord\r\nCarnarvon, Sir John Willard and Mr. Bleibner of New York, pursuing\r\ntheir excavations not far from Cairo, in the vicinity of the\r\nPyramids of Gizeh, came unexpectedly on a series of funeral\r\nchambers. The greatest interest was aroused by their discovery.\r\nThe Tomb appeared to be that of King Men-her-Ra, one of those\r\nshadowy kings of the Eighth Dynasty, when the Old Kingdom was\r\nfalling to decay. Little was known about this period, and the\r\ndiscoveries were fully reported in the newspapers.\r\n\r\nAn event soon occurred which took a profound hold on the public\r\nmind. Sir John Willard died quite suddenly of heart failure.\r\n\r\nThe more sensational newspapers immediately took the opportunity\r\nof reviving all the old superstitious stories connected with the\r\nill luck of certain Egyptian treasures. The unlucky Mummy at the\r\nBritish Museum, that hoary old chestnut, was dragged out with fresh\r\nzest, was quietly denied by the Museum, but nevertheless enjoyed\r\nall its usual vogue.\r\n\r\nA fortnight later Mr. Bleibner died of acute blood poisoning, and\r\na few days afterwards a nephew of his shot himself in New York.\r\nThe \u201cCurse of Men-her-Ra\u201d was the talk of the day, and the magic\r\npower of dead and gone Egypt was exalted to a fetish point.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Poirot received a brief note from Lady Willard,\r\nwidow of the dead archaeologist, asking him to go and see her at\r\nher house in Kensington Square. I accompanied him.\r\n\r\nLady Willard was a tall, thin woman, dressed in deep mourning. Her\r\nhaggard face bore eloquent testimony to her recent grief.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is kind of you to have come so promptly, Monsieur Poirot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am at your service, Lady Willard. You wished to consult me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are, I am aware, a detective, but it is not only as a detective\r\nthat I wish to consult you. You are a man of original views, I\r\nknow, you have imagination, experience of the world, tell me,\r\nMonsieur Poirot, what are your views on the supernatural?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot hesitated for a moment before he replied. He seemed to be\r\nconsidering. Finally he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us not misunderstand each other, Lady Willard. It is not a\r\ngeneral question that you are asking me there. It has a personal\r\napplication, has it not? You are referring obliquely to the death\r\nof your late husband?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is so,\u201d she admitted.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou want me to investigate the circumstances of his death?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI want you to ascertain for me exactly how much is newspaper\r\nchatter, and how much may be said to be founded on fact? Three\r\ndeaths, Monsieur Poirot\u2014each one explicable taken by itself, but\r\ntaken together surely an almost unbelievable coincidence, and all\r\nwithin a month of the opening of the tomb! It may be mere\r\nsuperstition, it may be some potent curse from the past that\r\noperates in ways undreamed of by modern science. The fact\r\nremains\u2014three deaths! And I am afraid, Monsieur Poirot, horribly\r\nafraid. It may not yet be the end.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor whom do you fear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor my son. When the news of my husband\u2019s death came I was ill.\r\nMy son, who has just come down from Oxford, went out there. He\r\nbrought the\u2014the body home, but now he has gone out again, in spite\r\nof my prayers and entreaties. He is so fascinated by the work that\r\nhe intends to take his father\u2019s place and carry on the system of\r\nexcavations. You may think me a foolish, credulous woman, but,\r\nMonsieur Poirot, I am afraid. Supposing that the spirit of the dead\r\nKing is not yet appeased? Perhaps to you I seem to be talking\r\nnonsense\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, indeed, Lady Willard,\u201d said Poirot quickly. \u201cI, too, believe\r\nin the force of superstition, one of the greatest forces the world\r\nhas ever known.\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked at him in surprise. I should never have credited Poirot\r\nwith being superstitious. But the little man was obviously in\r\nearnest.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat you really demand is that I shall protect your son? I will\r\ndo my utmost to keep him from harm.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, in the ordinary way, but against an occult influence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn volumes of the Middle Ages, Lady Willard, you will find many\r\nways of counteracting black magic. Perhaps they knew more than we\r\nmoderns with all our boasted science. Now let us come to facts,\r\nthat I may have guidance. Your husband had always been a devoted\r\nEgyptologist, hadn\u2019t he?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, from his youth upwards. He was one of the greatest living\r\nauthorities upon the subject.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Mr. Bleibner, I understand, was more or less of an amateur?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, quite. He was a very wealthy man who dabbled freely in any\r\nsubject that happened to take his fancy. My husband managed to\r\ninterest him in Egyptology, and it was his money that was so useful\r\nin financing the expedition.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the nephew? What do you know of his tastes? Was he with the\r\nparty at all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not think so. In fact I never knew of his existence till I\r\nread of his death in the paper, I do not think he and Mr. Bleibner\r\ncan have been at all intimate. He never spoke of having any\r\nrelations.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are the other members of the party?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there is Dr. Tosswill, a minor official connected with the\r\nBritish Museum; Mr. Schneider of the Metropolitan Museum in New\r\nYork; a young American secretary; Dr. Ames, who accompanies the\r\nexpedition in his professional capacity; and Hassan, my husband\u2019s\r\ndevoted native servant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you remember the name of the American secretary?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHarper, I think, but I cannot be sure. He had not been with Mr.\r\nBleibner very long, I know. He was a very pleasant young fellow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Lady Willard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf there is anything else\u2014\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor the moment, nothing. Leave it now in my hands, and be assured\r\nthat I will do all that is humanly possible to protect your son.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey were not exactly reassuring words, and I observed Lady Willard\r\nwince as he uttered them. Yet, at the same time, the fact that he\r\nhad not pooh-poohed her fears seemed in itself to be a relief to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nFor my part I had never before suspected that Poirot had so deep\r\na vein of superstition in his nature. I tackled him on the subject\r\nas we went homewards. His manner was grave and earnest.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut yes, Hastings. I believe in these things. You must not\r\nunderrate the force of superstition.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do about it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Toujours pratique_, the good Hastings! _Eh bien_, to begin with\r\nwe are going to cable to New York for fuller details of young Mr.\r\nBleibner\u2019s death.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe duly sent off his cable. The reply was full and precise. Young\r\nRupert Bleibner had been in low water for several years. He had\r\nbeen a beach-comber and a remittance man in several South Sea\r\nislands, but had returned to New York two years ago, where he had\r\nrapidly sunk lower and lower. The most significant thing, to my\r\nmind, was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to\r\ntake him to Egypt. \u201cI\u2019ve a good friend there I can borrow from,\u201d\r\nhe had declared. Here, however, his plans had gone awry. He had\r\nreturned to New York cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared\r\nmore for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and\r\nblood. It was during his sojourn in Egypt that the death of Sir\r\nJohn Willard occurred. Rupert had plunged once more into his life\r\nof dissipation in New York, and then, without warning, he had\r\ncommitted suicide, leaving behind him a letter which contained some\r\ncurious phrases. It seemed written in a sudden fit of remorse. He\r\nreferred to himself as a leper and an outcast, and the letter ended\r\nby declaring that such as he were better dead.\r\n\r\nA shadowy theory leapt into my brain. I had never really believed\r\nin the vengeance of a long dead Egyptian king. I saw here a more\r\nmodern crime. Supposing this young man had decided to do away with\r\nhis uncle\u2014preferably by poison. By mistake, Sir John Willard\r\nreceives the fatal dose. The young man returns to New York, haunted\r\nby his crime. The news of his uncle\u2019s death reaches him. He realizes\r\nhow unnecessary his crime has been, and stricken with remorse takes\r\nhis own life.\r\n\r\nI outlined my solution to Poirot. He was interested.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is ingenious what you have thought of there\u2014decidedly it is\r\ningenious. It may even be true. But you leave out of count the\r\nfatal influence of the Tomb.\u201d\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou still think that has something to do with it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo much so, _mon ami_, that we start for Egypt to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I cried, astonished.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have said it.\u201d An expression of conscious heroism spread over\r\nPoirot\u2019s face. Then he groaned. \u201cBut, oh,\u201d he lamented, \u201cthe sea!\r\nThe hateful sea!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n  \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a week later. Beneath our feet was the golden sand of the\r\ndesert. The hot sun poured down overhead. Poirot, the picture of\r\nmisery, wilted by my side. The little man was not a good traveller.\r\nOur four days\u2019 voyage from Marseilles had been one long agony to\r\nhim. He had landed at Alexandria the wraith of his former self,\r\neven his usual neatness had deserted him. We had arrived in Cairo\r\nand had driven out at once to the Mena House Hotel, right in the\r\nshadow of the Pyramids.\r\n\r\nThe charm of Egypt had laid hold of me. Not so Poirot. Dressed\r\nprecisely the same as in London, he carried a small clothes-brush\r\nin his pocket and waged an unceasing war on the dust which\r\naccumulated on his dark apparel.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd my boots,\u201d he wailed. \u201cRegard them, Hastings. My boots, of\r\nthe neat patent leather, usually so smart and shining. See, the\r\nsand is inside them, which is painful, and outside them, which\r\noutrages the eyesight. Also the heat, it causes my moustaches to\r\nbecome limp\u2014but limp!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at the Sphinx,\u201d I urged. \u201cEven I can feel the mystery and\r\nthe charm it exhales.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot looked at it discontentedly.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has not the air happy,\u201d he declared. \u201cHow could it, half-buried\r\nin sand in that untidy fashion. Ah, this cursed sand!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, now, there\u2019s a lot of sand in Belgium,\u201d I reminded him,\r\nmindful of a holiday spent at Knocke-sur-mer in the midst of \u201c_les\r\ndunes impeccables_\u201d as the guide-book had phrased it.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot in Brussels,\u201d declared Poirot. He gazed at the Pyramids\r\nthoughtfully. \u201cIt is true that they, at least, are of a shape solid\r\nand geometrical, but their surface is of an unevenness most\r\nunpleasing. And the palm-trees I like them not. Not even do they\r\nplant them in rows!\u201d\r\n\r\nI cut short his lamentations, by suggesting that we should start\r\nfor the camp. We were to ride there on camels, and the beasts were\r\npatiently kneeling, waiting for us to mount, in charge of several\r\npicturesque boys headed by a voluble dragoman.\r\n\r\nI pass over the spectacle of Poirot on a camel. He started by\r\ngroans and lamentations and ended by shrieks, gesticulations and\r\ninvocations to the Virgin Mary and every Saint in the calendar. In\r\nthe end, he descended ignominiously and finished the journey on a\r\ndiminutive donkey. I must admit that a trotting camel is no joke\r\nfor the amateur. I was stiff for several days.\r\n\r\nAt last we neared the scene of the excavations. A sunburnt man with\r\na grey beard, in white clothes and wearing a helmet, came to meet\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings? We received your cable. I\u2019m\r\nsorry that there was no one to meet you in Cairo. An unforeseen\r\nevent occurred which completely disorganized our plans.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot paled. His hand, which had stolen to his clothes-brush,\r\nstayed its course.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot another death?\u201d he breathed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSir Guy Willard?\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, Captain Hastings. My American colleague, Mr. Schneider.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the cause?\u201d demanded Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cTetanus.\u201d\r\n\r\nI blanched. All around me I seemed to feel an atmosphere of evil,\r\nsubtle and menacing. A horrible thought flashed across me. Supposing\r\nI were the next?\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon Dieu_,\u201d said Poirot, in a very low voice, \u201cI do not understand\r\nthis. It is horrible. Tell me, monsieur, there is no doubt that it\r\nwas tetanus?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe not. But Dr. Ames will tell you more than I can do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, of course, you are not the doctor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Tosswill.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the British expert described by Lady Willard as\r\nbeing a minor official at the British Museum. There was something\r\nat once grave and steadfast about him that took my fancy.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you will come with me,\u201d continued Dr. Tosswill, \u201cI will take\r\nyou to Sir Guy Willard. He was most anxious to be informed as soon\r\nas you should arrive.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe were taken across the camp to a large tent. Dr. Tosswill lifted\r\nup the flap and we entered. Three men were sitting inside.\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings have arrived, Sir Guy,\u201d said\r\nTosswill.\r\n\r\nThe youngest of the three men jumped up and came forward to greet\r\nus. There was a certain impulsiveness in his manner which reminded\r\nme of his mother. He was not nearly so sunburnt as the others, and\r\nthat fact, coupled with a certain haggardness round the eyes, made\r\nhim look older than his twenty-two years. He was clearly endeavouring\r\nto bear up under a severe mental strain.\r\n\r\nHe introduced his two companions, Dr. Ames, a capable looking man\r\nof thirty odd, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, and\r\nMr. Harper, the secretary, a pleasant lean young man wearing the\r\nnational insignia of horn-rimmed spectacles.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes\u2019 desultory conversation the latter went out,\r\nand Dr. Tosswill followed him. We were left alone with Sir Guy and\r\nDr. Ames.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease ask any questions you want to ask, Monsieur Poirot,\u201d said\r\nWillard. \u201cWe are utterly dumbfounded at this strange series of\r\ndisasters, but it isn\u2019t\u2014it can\u2019t be, anything but coincidence.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a nervousness about his manner which rather belied the\r\nwords. I saw that Poirot was studying him keenly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour heart is really in this work, Sir Guy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRather. No matter what happens, or what comes of it, the work is\r\ngoing on. Make up your mind to that.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot wheeled round on the other.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat have you to say to that, _monsieur le docteur_?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d drawled the doctor, \u201cI\u2019m not for quitting myself.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot made one of those expressive grimaces of his.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, _\u00e9videmment_, we must find out just how we stand. When did\r\nMr. Schneider\u2019s death take place?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThree days ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure it was tetanus?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDead sure.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been a case of strychnine poisoning, for\r\ninstance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, Monsieur Poirot. I see what you\u2019re getting at. But it was a\r\nclear case of tetanus.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you not inject anti-serum?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly we did,\u201d said the doctor dryly. \u201cEvery conceivable thing\r\nthat could be done was tried.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHad you the anti-serum with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. We procured it from Cairo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave there been any other cases of tetanus in the camp?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, not one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you certain that the death of Mr. Bleibner was not due to\r\ntetanus?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely plumb certain. He had a scratch upon his thumb which\r\nbecame poisoned, and septic\u00e6mia set in. It sounds pretty much the\r\nsame to a layman, I dare say, but the two things are entirely\r\ndifferent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we have four deaths\u2014all totally dissimilar, one heart failure,\r\none blood poisoning, one suicide and one tetanus.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly, Monsieur Poirot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you certain that there is nothing which might link the four\r\ntogether?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite understand you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will put it plainly. Was any act committed by those four men\r\nwhich might seem to denote disrespect to the spirit of Men-her-Ra?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor gazed at Poirot in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking through your hat, Monsieur Poirot. Surely you\u2019ve\r\nnot been guyed into believing all that fool talk?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolute nonsense,\u201d muttered Willard angrily.\r\n\r\nPoirot remained placidly immovable, blinking a little out of his\r\ngreen cat\u2019s eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you do not believe it, _monsieur le docteur_?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, I do not,\u201d declared the doctor emphatically. \u201cI am a\r\nscientific man, and I believe only what science teaches.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas there no science then in Ancient Egypt?\u201d asked Poirot softly.\r\nHe did not wait for a reply, and indeed Dr. Ames seemed rather at\r\na loss for the moment. \u201cNo, no, do not answer me, but tell me this.\r\nWhat do the native workmen think?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess,\u201d said Dr. Ames, \u201cthat, where white folk lose their heads,\r\nnatives aren\u2019t going to be far behind. I\u2019ll admit that they\u2019re\r\ngetting what you might call scared\u2014but they\u2019ve no cause to be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d said Poirot non-committally.\r\n\r\nSir Guy leant forward.\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely,\u201d he cried incredulously, \u201cyou cannot believe in\u2014oh, but\r\nthe thing\u2019s absurd! You can know nothing of Ancient Egypt if you\r\nthink that.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor answer Poirot produced a little book from his pocket\u2014an ancient\r\ntattered volume. As he held it out I saw its title, _The Magic of\r\nthe Egyptians and Chaldeans_. Then, wheeling round, he strode out\r\nof the tent. The doctor stared at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is his little idea?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe phrase, so familiar on Poirot\u2019s lips, made me smile as it came\r\nfrom another.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly,\u201d I confessed. \u201cHe\u2019s got some plan of\r\nexorcizing the evil spirits, I believe.\u201d\r\n\r\nI went in search of Poirot, and found him talking to the lean-faced\r\nyoung man who had been the late Mr. Bleibner\u2019s secretary.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Harper was saying, \u201cI\u2019ve only been six months with the\r\nexpedition. Yes, I knew Mr. Bleibner\u2019s affairs pretty well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you recount to me anything concerning his nephew?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe turned up here one day, not a bad-looking fellow. I\u2019d never\r\nmet him before, but some of the others had\u2014Ames, I think, and\r\nSchneider. The old man wasn\u2019t at all pleased to see him. They were\r\nat it in no time, hammer and tongs. \u2018Not a cent,\u2019 the old man\r\nshouted. \u2018Not one cent now or when I\u2019m dead. I intend to leave my\r\nmoney to the furtherance of my life\u2019s work. I\u2019ve been talking it\r\nover with Mr. Schneider to-day.\u2019 And a bit more of the same. Young\r\nBleibner lit out for Cairo right away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas he in perfectly good health at the time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe old man?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, the young one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe he did mention there was something wrong with him. But\r\nit couldn\u2019t have been anything serious, or I should have remembered.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne thing more, has Mr. Bleibner left a will?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo far as we know, he has not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre you remaining with the expedition, Mr. Harper?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, I am not. I\u2019m for New York as soon as I can square up\r\nthings here. You may laugh if you like, but I\u2019m not going to be\r\nthis blasted old Men-her-Ra\u2019s next victim. He\u2019ll get me if I stop\r\nhere.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe young man wiped the perspiration from his brow.\r\n\r\nPoirot turned away. Over his shoulder he said with a peculiar\r\nsmile:\r\n\r\n\u201cRemember, he got one of his victims in New York.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, hell!\u201d said Mr. Harper forcibly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat young man is nervous,\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully. \u201cHe is on\r\nthe edge, but absolutely on the edge.\u201d\r\n\r\nI glanced at Poirot curiously, but his enigmatical smile told me\r\nnothing. In company with Sir Guy Willard and Dr. Tosswill we were\r\ntaken round the excavations. The principal finds had been removed\r\nto Cairo, but some of the tomb furniture was extremely interesting.\r\nThe enthusiasm of the young baronet was obvious, but I fancied that\r\nI detected a shade of nervousness in his manner as though he could\r\nnot quite escape from the feeling of menace in the air. As we\r\nentered the tent which had been assigned to us, for a wash before\r\njoining the evening meal, a tall dark figure in white robes stood\r\naside to let us pass with a graceful gesture and a murmured greeting\r\nin Arabic. Poirot stopped.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are Hassan, the late Sir John Willard\u2019s servant?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI served my Lord Sir John, now I serve his son.\u201d He took a step\r\nnearer to us and lowered his voice. \u201cYou are a wise one, they say,\r\nlearned in dealing with evil spirits. Let the young master depart\r\nfrom here. There is evil in the air around us.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd with an abrupt gesture, not waiting for a reply, he strode\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvil in the air,\u201d muttered Poirot. \u201cYes, I feel it.\u201d\r\n\r\nOur meal was hardly a cheerful one. The floor was left to Dr.\r\nTosswill, who discoursed at length upon Egyptian antiquities. Just\r\nas we were preparing to retire to rest, Sir Guy caught Poirot by\r\nthe arm and pointed. A shadowy figure was moving amidst the tents.\r\nIt was no human one: I recognized distinctly the dog-headed figure\r\nI had seen carved on the walls of the tomb.\r\n\r\nMy blood literally froze at the sight.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon Dieu!_\u201d murmured Poirot, crossing himself vigorously. \u201cAnubis,\r\nthe jackal-headed, the god of departing souls.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSome one is hoaxing us,\u201d cried Dr. Tosswill, rising indignantly\r\nto his feet.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt went into your tent, Harper,\u201d muttered Sir Guy, his face\r\ndreadfully pale.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Poirot, shaking his head, \u201cinto that of the Dr. Ames.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor stared at him incredulously; then, repeating Dr.\r\nTosswill\u2019s words, he cried:\r\n\r\n\u201cSome one is hoaxing us. Come, we\u2019ll soon catch the fellow.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe dashed energetically in pursuit of the shadowy apparition. I\r\nfollowed him, but, search as we would, we could find no trace of\r\nany living soul having passed that way. We returned, somewhat\r\ndisturbed in mind, to find Poirot taking energetic measures, in\r\nhis own way, to ensure his personal safety. He was busily\r\nsurrounding our tent with various diagrams and inscriptions which\r\nhe was drawing in the sand. I recognized the five-pointed star or\r\nPentagon many times repeated. As was his wont, Poirot was at the\r\nsame time delivering an impromptu lecture on witchcraft and magic\r\nin general, White Magic as opposed to Black, with various references\r\nto the Ka and the Book of the Dead thrown in.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to excite the liveliest contempt in Dr. Tosswill, who\r\ndrew me aside, literally snorting with rage.\r\n\r\n\u201cBalderdash, sir,\u201d he exclaimed angrily. \u201cPure balderdash. The\r\nman\u2019s an impostor. He doesn\u2019t know the difference between the\r\nsuperstitions of the Middle Ages and the beliefs of Ancient Egypt.\r\nNever have I heard such a hotch-potch of ignorance and credulity.\u201d\r\n\r\nI calmed the excited expert, and joined Poirot in the tent. My\r\nlittle friend was beaming cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe can now sleep in peace,\u201d he declared happily. \u201cAnd I can do\r\nwith some sleep. My head, it aches abominably. Ah, for a good\r\n_tisane_!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs though in answer to prayer, the flap of the tent was lifted and\r\nHassan appeared, bearing a steaming cup which he offered to Poirot.\r\nIt proved to be camomile tea, a beverage of which he is inordinately\r\nfond. Having thanked Hassan and refused his offer of another cup\r\nfor myself, we were left alone once more. I stood at the door of\r\nthe tent some time after undressing, looking out over the desert.\r\n\r\n\u201cA wonderful place,\u201d I said aloud, \u201cand a wonderful work. I can\r\nfeel the fascination. This desert life, this probing into the heart\r\nof a vanished civilization. Surely, Poirot, you, too, must feel\r\nthe charm?\u201d\r\n\r\nI got no answer, and I turned, a little annoyed. My annoyance was\r\nquickly changed to concern. Poirot was lying back across the rude\r\ncouch, his face horribly convulsed. Beside him was the empty cup.\r\nI rushed to his side, then dashed out and across the camp to Dr.\r\nAmes\u2019s tent.\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Ames!\u201d I cried. \u201cCome at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d said the doctor, appearing in pyjamas.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy friend. He\u2019s ill. Dying. The camomile tea. Don\u2019t let Hassan\r\nleave the camp.\u201d\r\n\r\nLike a flash the doctor ran to our tent. Poirot was lying as I left\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\u201cExtraordinary,\u201d cried Ames. \u201cLooks like a seizure\u2014or\u2014what did you\r\nsay about something he drank?\u201d He picked up the empty cup.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly I did not drink it!\u201d said a placid voice.\r\n\r\nWe turned in amazement. Poirot was sitting up on the bed. He was\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI did not drink it. While my good friend\r\nHastings was apostrophizing the night, I took the opportunity of\r\npouring it, not down my throat, but into a little bottle. That\r\nlittle bottle will go to the analytical chemist. No\u201d\u2014as the doctor\r\nmade a sudden movement\u2014\u201cas a sensible man, you will understand that\r\nviolence will be of no avail. During Hastings\u2019 brief absence to\r\nfetch you, I have had time to put the bottle in safe keeping. Ah,\r\nquick, Hastings, hold him!\u201d\r\n\r\nI misunderstood Poirot\u2019s anxiety. Eager to save my friend, I flung\r\nmyself in front of him. But the doctor\u2019s swift movement had another\r\nmeaning. His hand went to his mouth, a smell of bitter almonds\r\nfilled the air, and he swayed forward and fell.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnother victim,\u201d said Poirot gravely, \u201cbut the last. Perhaps it\r\nis the best way. He has three deaths on his head.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Ames?\u201d I cried, stupefied. \u201cBut I thought you believed in some\r\noccult influence?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou misunderstood me, Hastings. What I meant was that I believe\r\nin the terrific force of superstition. Once get it firmly\r\nestablished that a series of deaths are supernatural, and you might\r\nalmost stab a man in broad daylight, and it would still be put down\r\nto the curse, so strongly is the instinct of the supernatural\r\nimplanted in the human race. I suspected from the first that a man\r\nwas taking advantage of that instinct. The idea came to him, I\r\nimagine, with the death of Sir John Willard. A fury of superstition\r\narose at once. As far as I could see, nobody could derive any\r\nparticular profit from Sir John\u2019s death. Mr. Bleibner was a\r\ndifferent case. He was a man of great wealth. The information I\r\nreceived from New York contained several suggestive points. To\r\nbegin with, young Bleibner was reported to have said he had a good\r\nfriend in Egypt from whom he could borrow. It was tacitly understood\r\nthat he meant his uncle, but it seemed to me that in that case he\r\nwould have said so outright. The words suggest some boon companion\r\nof his own. Another thing, he scraped up enough money to take him\r\nto Egypt, his uncle refused outright to advance him a penny, yet\r\nhe was able to pay the return passage to New York. Some one must\r\nhave lent him the money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll that was very thin,\u201d I objected.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut there was more. Hastings, there occur often enough words\r\nspoken metaphorically which are taken literally. The opposite can\r\nhappen too. In this case, words which were meant literally were\r\ntaken metaphorically. Young Bleibner wrote plainly enough: \u2018I am\r\na leper,\u2019 but nobody realized that he shot himself because he\r\nbelieved that he had contracted the dread disease of leprosy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was the clever invention of a diabolical mind. Young Bleibner\r\nwas suffering from some minor skin trouble, he had lived in the\r\nSouth Sea Islands, where the disease is common enough. Ames was a\r\nformer friend of his, and a well-known medical man, he would never\r\ndream of doubting his word. When I arrived here, my suspicions were\r\ndivided between Harper and Dr. Ames, but I soon realized that only\r\nthe doctor could have perpetrated and concealed the crimes, and I\r\nlearnt from Harper that he was previously acquainted with young\r\nBleibner. Doubtless the latter at some time or another had made a\r\nwill or had insured his life in favour of the doctor. The latter\r\nsaw his chance of acquiring wealth. It was easy for him to inoculate\r\nMr. Bleibner with the deadly germs. Then the nephew, overcome with\r\ndespair at the dread news his friend had conveyed to him, shot\r\nhimself. Mr. Bleibner, whatever his intentions, had made no will.\r\nHis fortune would pass to his nephew and from him to the doctor.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Mr. Schneider?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe cannot be sure. He knew young Bleibner too, remember, and may\r\nhave suspected something, or, again, the doctor may have thought\r\nthat a further death motiveless and purposeless would strengthen\r\nthe coils of superstition. Furthermore, I will tell you an\r\ninteresting psychological fact, Hastings. A murderer has always a\r\nstrong desire to repeat his successful crime, the performance of\r\nit grows upon him. Hence my fears for young Willard. The figure of\r\nAnubis you saw to-night was Hassan, dressed up by my orders. I\r\nwanted to see if I could frighten the doctor. But it would take\r\nmore than the supernatural to frighten him. I could see that he\r\nwas not entirely taken in by my pretences of belief in the occult.\r\nThe little comedy I played for him did not deceive him. I suspected\r\nthat he would endeavour to make me the next victim. Ah, but in\r\nspite of _la mer maudite_, the heat abominable, and the annoyances\r\nof the sand, the little grey cells still functioned!\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot proved to be perfectly right in his premises. Young Bleibner,\r\nsome years ago, in a fit of drunken merriment, had made a jocular\r\nwill, leaving \u201cmy cigarette case you admire so much and everything\r\nelse of which I die possessed which will be principally debts to\r\nmy good friend Robert Ames who once saved my life from drowning.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe case was hushed up as far as possible, and, to this day, people\r\ntalk of the remarkable series of deaths in connection with the Tomb\r\nof Men-her-Ra as a triumphal proof of the vengeance of a bygone\r\nking upon the desecrators of his tomb\u2014a belief which, as Poirot\r\npointed out to me, is contrary to all Egyptian belief and thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  VII\r\n\r\n  The Jewel Robbery at the _Grand Metropolitan_\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I said, \u201ca change of air would do you good.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think so, _mon ami_?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEh\u2014eh?\u201d said my friend, smiling. \u201cIt is all arranged, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will come?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere do you propose to take me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBrighton. As a matter of fact, a friend of mine in the City put\r\nme on to a very good thing, and\u2014well, I have money to burn, as the\r\nsaying goes. I think a week-end at the _Grand Metropolitan_ would\r\ndo us all the good in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, I accept most gratefully. You have the good heart to\r\nthink of an old man. And the good heart, it is in the end worth\r\nall the little grey cells. Yes, yes, I who speak to you am in\r\ndanger of forgetting that sometimes.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did not quite relish the implication. I fancy that Poirot is\r\nsometimes a little inclined to underestimate my mental capacities.\r\nBut his pleasure was so evident that I put my slight annoyance\r\naside.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, that\u2019s all right,\u201d I said hastily.\r\n\r\nSaturday evening saw us dining at the _Grand Metropolitan_ in the\r\nmidst of a gay throng. All the world and his wife seemed to be at\r\nBrighton. The dresses were marvellous, and the jewels\u2014worn sometimes\r\nwith more love of display than good taste\u2014were something magnificent.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Hein_, it is a sight this!\u201d murmured Poirot. \u201cThis is the home\r\nof the Profiteer, is it not so, Hastings?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSupposed to be,\u201d I replied. \u201cBut we\u2019ll hope they aren\u2019t all tarred\r\nwith the Profiteering brush.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot gazed round him placidly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe sight of so many jewels makes me wish I had turned my brains\r\nto crime, instead of to its detection. What a magnificent\r\nopportunity for some thief of distinction! Regard, Hastings, that\r\nstout woman by the pillar. She is, as you would say, plastered with\r\ngems.\u201d\r\n\r\nI followed his eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d I exclaimed, \u201cit\u2019s Mrs. Opalsen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know her?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSlightly. Her husband is a rich stockbroker who made a fortune in\r\nthe recent Oil boom.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we ran across the Opalsens in the lounge, and I\r\nintroduced Poirot to them. We chatted for a few minutes, and ended\r\nby having our coffee together.\r\n\r\nPoirot said a few words in praise of some of the costlier gems\r\ndisplayed on the lady\u2019s ample bosom, and she brightened up at once.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect hobby of mine, Mr. Poirot. I just _love_ jewellery.\r\nEd knows my weakness, and every time things go well he brings me\r\nsomething new. You are interested in precious stones?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have had a good deal to do with them one time and another,\r\nmadame. My profession has brought me into contact with some of the\r\nmost famous jewels in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe went on to narrate, with discreet pseudonyms, the story of the\r\nhistoric jewels of a reigning house, and Mrs. Opalsen listened with\r\nbated breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere now!\u201d she exclaimed, as he ended. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t just like a\r\nplay! You know, I\u2019ve got some pearls of my own that have a history\r\nattached to them. I believe it\u2019s supposed to be one of the finest\r\nnecklaces in the world\u2014the pearls are so beautifully matched and\r\nso perfect in colour. I declare I really must run up and get it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, madame,\u201d protested Poirot, \u201cyou are too amiable. Pray do not\r\nderange yourself!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, but I\u2019d like to show it to you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe buxom dame waddled across to the lift briskly enough. Her\r\nhusband, who had been talking to me, looked at Poirot inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame your wife is so amiable as to insist on showing me her\r\npearl necklace,\u201d explained the latter.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, the pearls!\u201d Opalsen smiled in a satisfied fashion. \u201cWell,\r\nthey _are_ worth seeing. Cost a pretty penny too! Still, the\r\nmoney\u2019s there all right; I could get what I paid for them any\r\nday\u2014perhaps more. May have to, too, if things go on as they are\r\nnow. Money\u2019s confoundedly tight in the City. All this infernal\r\nE.P.D.\u201d He rambled on, launching into technicalities where I could\r\nnot follow him.\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by a small page-boy who approached and murmured\r\nsomething in his ear.\r\n\r\n\u201cEh\u2014what? I\u2019ll come at once. Not taken ill, is she? Excuse me,\r\ngentlemen.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe left us abruptly. Poirot leaned back and lit one of his tiny\r\nRussian cigarettes. Then, carefully and meticulously, he arranged\r\nthe empty coffee-cups in a neat row, and beamed happily on the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe minutes passed. The Opalsens did not return.\r\n\r\n\u201cCurious,\u201d I remarked, at length. \u201cI wonder when they will come\r\nback.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot watched the ascending spirals of smoke, and then said\r\nthoughtfully:\r\n\r\n\u201cThey will not come back.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause, my friend, something has happened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat sort of thing? How do you know?\u201d I asked curiously.\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cA few moments ago the manager came hurriedly out of his office\r\nand ran upstairs. He was much agitated. The lift-boy is deep in\r\ntalk with one of the pages. The lift-bell has rung three times,\r\nbut he heeds it not. Thirdly, even the waiters are _distrait_; and\r\nto make a waiter _distrait_\u2014\u2014\u201d Poirot shook his head with an air\r\nof finality. \u201cThe affair must indeed be of the first magnitude.\r\nAh, it is as I thought! Here come the police.\u201d\r\n\r\nTwo men had just entered the hotel\u2014one in uniform, the other in\r\nplain clothes. They spoke to a page, and were immediately ushered\r\nupstairs. A few minutes later, the same boy descended and came up\r\nto where we were sitting.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Opalsen\u2019s compliments, and would you step upstairs.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot sprang nimbly to his feet. One would have said that he\r\nawaited the summons. I followed with no less alacrity.\r\n\r\nThe Opalsens\u2019 apartments were situated on the first floor. After\r\nknocking on the door, the page-boy retired, and we answered the\r\nsummons, \u201cCome in!\u201d A strange scene met our eyes. The room was Mrs.\r\nOpalsen\u2019s bedroom, and in the centre of it, lying back in an\r\narm-chair, was the lady herself, weeping violently. She presented\r\nan extraordinary spectacle, with the tears making great furrows in\r\nthe powder with which her complexion was liberally coated. Mr.\r\nOpalsen was striding up and down angrily. The two police officials\r\nstood in the middle of the room, one with a notebook in hand. An\r\nhotel chambermaid, looking frightened to death, stood by the\r\nfire-place; and on the other side of the room a Frenchwoman,\r\nobviously Mrs. Opalsen\u2019s maid, was weeping and wringing her hands,\r\nwith an intensity of grief that rivalled that of her mistress.\r\n\r\nInto this pandemonium stepped Poirot, neat and smiling. Immediately,\r\nwith an energy surprising in one of her bulk, Mrs. Opalsen sprang\r\nfrom her chair towards him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere now; Ed may say what he likes, but I believe in luck, I do.\r\nIt was fated I should meet you the way I did this evening, and I\u2019ve\r\na feeling that if you can\u2019t get my pearls back for me nobody can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCalm yourself, I pray of you, madame.\u201d Poirot patted her hand\r\nsoothingly. \u201cReassure yourself. All will be well. Hercule Poirot\r\nwill aid you!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Opalsen turned to the police inspector.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere will be no objection to my\u2014er\u2014calling in this gentleman, I\r\nsuppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNone at all, sir,\u201d replied the man civilly, but with complete\r\nindifference. \u201cPerhaps now your lady\u2019s feeling better she\u2019ll just\r\nlet us have the facts?\u201d\r\n\r\nMrs. Opalsen looked helplessly at Poirot. He led her back to her\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\u201cSeat yourself, madame, and recount to us the whole history without\r\nagitating yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus abjured, Mrs. Opalsen dried her eyes gingerly, and began.\r\n\r\n\u201cI came upstairs after dinner to fetch my pearls for Mr. Poirot\r\nhere to see. The chambermaid and C\u00e9lestine were both in the room\r\nas usual\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me, madame, but what do you mean by \u2018as usual\u2019?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Opalsen explained.\r\n\r\n\u201cI make it a rule that no one is to come into this room unless\r\nC\u00e9lestine, the maid, is there also. The chambermaid does the room\r\nin the morning while C\u00e9lestine is present, and comes in after\r\ndinner to turn down the beds under the same conditions; otherwise\r\nshe never enters the room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, as I was saying,\u201d continued Mrs. Opalsen, \u201cI came up. I went\r\nto the drawer here,\u201d\u2014she indicated the bottom right-hand drawer of\r\nthe knee-hole dressing-table\u2014\u201ctook out my jewel-case and unlocked\r\nit. It seemed quite as usual\u2014but the pearls were not there!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe inspector had been busy with his notebook. \u201cWhen had you last\r\nseen them?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey were there when I went down to dinner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are sure?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite sure. I was uncertain whether to wear them or not, but in\r\nthe end I decided on the emeralds, and put them back in the\r\njewel-case.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho locked up the jewel-case?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did. I wear the key on a chain round my neck.\u201d She held it up\r\nas she spoke.\r\n\r\nThe inspector examined it, and shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe thief must have had a duplicate key. No difficult matter. The\r\nlock is quite a simple one. What did you do after you\u2019d locked the\r\njewel-case?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI put it back in the bottom drawer where I always keep it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t lock the drawer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I never do. My maid remains in the room till I come up, so\r\nthere\u2019s no need.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe inspector\u2019s face grew graver.\r\n\r\n\u201cAm I to understand that the jewels were there when you went down\r\nto dinner, and that since then _the maid has not left the room_?\u201d\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as though the horror of her own situation for the first\r\ntime burst upon her, C\u00e9lestine uttered a piercing shriek, and,\r\nflinging herself upon Poirot, poured out a torrent of incoherent\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was infamous! That she should be suspected of\r\nrobbing Madame! The police were well known to be of a stupidity\r\nincredible! But Monsieur, who was a Frenchman\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201cA Belgian,\u201d interjected Poirot, but C\u00e9lestine paid no attention\r\nto the correction.\r\n\r\nMonsieur would not stand by and see her falsely accused, while that\r\ninfamous chambermaid was allowed to go scot-free. She had never\r\nliked her\u2014a bold, red-faced thing\u2014a born thief. She had said from\r\nthe first that she was not honest. And had kept a sharp watch over\r\nher too, when she was doing Madame\u2019s room! Let those idiots of\r\npolicemen search her, and if they did not find Madame\u2019s pearls on\r\nher it would be very surprising!\r\n\r\nAlthough this harangue was uttered in rapid and virulent French,\r\nC\u00e9lestine had interlarded it with a wealth of gesture, and the\r\nchambermaid realized at least a part of her meaning. She reddened\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf that foreign woman\u2019s saying I took the pearls, it\u2019s a lie!\u201d\r\nshe declared heatedly. \u201cI never so much as saw them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSearch her!\u201d screamed the other. \u201cYou will find it is as I say.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a liar\u2014do you hear?\u201d said the chambermaid, advancing upon\r\nher. \u201cStole \u2019em yourself, and want to put it on me. Why, I was only\r\nin the room about three minutes before the lady come up, and then\r\nyou were sitting here the whole time, as you always do, like a cat\r\nwatching a mouse.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe inspector looked across inquiringly at C\u00e9lestine. \u201cIs that\r\ntrue? Didn\u2019t you leave the room at all?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did not actually leave her alone,\u201d admitted C\u00e9lestine reluctantly,\r\n\u201cbut I went into my own room through the door here twice\u2014once to\r\nfetch a reel of cotton, and once for my scissors. She must have\r\ndone it then.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou wasn\u2019t gone a minute,\u201d retorted the chambermaid angrily. \u201cJust\r\npopped out and in again. I\u2019d be glad if the police _would_ search\r\nme. _I\u2019ve nothing to be afraid of_.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was a tap at the door. The inspector went to\r\nit. His face brightened when he saw who it was.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s rather fortunate. I sent for one of our\r\nfemale searchers, and she\u2019s just arrived. Perhaps if you wouldn\u2019t\r\nmind going into the room next door.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked at the chambermaid, who stepped across the threshold with\r\na toss of her head, the searcher following her closely.\r\n\r\nThe French girl had sunk sobbing into a chair. Poirot was looking\r\nround the room, the main features of which I have made clear by a\r\nsketch.\r\n\r\n[A sketch of the bedroom, adjoining maid's room, and corridor.]\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere does that door lead?\u201d he inquired, nodding his head towards\r\nthe one by the window.\r\n\r\n\u201cInto the next apartment, I believe,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cIt\u2019s\r\nbolted, anyway, on this side.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot walked across to it, tried it, then drew back the bolt and\r\ntried it again.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd on the other side as well,\u201d he remarked. \u201cWell, that seems to\r\nrule out that.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe walked over to the windows, examining each of them in turn.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd again\u2014nothing. Not even a balcony outside.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEven if there were,\u201d said the inspector impatiently, \u201cI don\u2019t see\r\nhow that would help us, if the maid never left the room.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_\u00c9videmment_,\u201d said Poirot, not disconcerted. \u201cAs Mademoiselle is\r\npositive she did not leave the room\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by the reappearance of the chambermaid and the\r\npolice searcher.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said the latter laconically.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should hope not, indeed,\u201d said the chambermaid virtuously. \u201cAnd\r\nthat French hussy ought to be ashamed of herself taking away an\r\nhonest girl\u2019s character!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, there, my girl; that\u2019s all right,\u201d said the inspector,\r\nopening the door. \u201cNobody suspects you. You go along and get on\r\nwith your work.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe chambermaid went unwillingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cGoing to search _her_?\u201d she demanded, pointing at C\u00e9lestine.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes!\u201d He shut the door on her and turned the key.\r\n\r\nC\u00e9lestine accompanied the searcher into the small room in her turn.\r\nA few minutes later she also returned. Nothing had been found on\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe inspector\u2019s face grew graver.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to ask you to come along with me all the\r\nsame, miss.\u201d He turned to Mrs. Opalsen. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, madam, but all\r\nthe evidence points that way. If she\u2019s not got them on her, they\u2019re\r\nhidden somewhere about the room.\u201d\r\n\r\nC\u00e9lestine uttered a piercing shriek, and clung to Poirot\u2019s arm.\r\nThe latter bent and whispered something in the girl\u2019s ear. She\r\nlooked up at him doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Si, si, mon enfant_\u2014I assure you it is better not to resist.\u201d\r\nThen he turned to the inspector. \u201cYou permit, monsieur? A little\r\nexperiment\u2014purely for my own satisfaction.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDepends on what it is,\u201d replied the police officer non-committally.\r\n\r\nPoirot addressed C\u00e9lestine once more.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have told us that you went into your room to fetch a reel of\r\ncotton. Whereabouts was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the top of the chest of drawers, monsieur.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the scissors?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey also.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould it be troubling you too much, mademoiselle, to ask you to\r\nrepeat those two actions? You were sitting here with your work,\r\nyou say?\u201d\r\n\r\nC\u00e9lestine sat down, and then, at a sign from Poirot, rose, passed\r\ninto the adjoining room, took up an object from the chest of\r\ndrawers, and returned.\r\n\r\nPoirot divided his attention between her movements and a large\r\nturnip of a watch which he held in the palm of his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201cAgain, if you please, mademoiselle.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the second performance, he made a note in his\r\npocket-book, and returned the watch to his pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, mademoiselle. And you, monsieur,\u201d\u2014he bowed to the\r\ninspector\u2014\u201cfor your courtesy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe inspector seemed somewhat entertained by this excessive\r\npoliteness. C\u00e9lestine departed in a flood of tears, accompanied by\r\nthe woman and the plain-clothes official.\r\n\r\nThen, with a brief apology to Mrs. Opalsen, the inspector set to\r\nwork to ransack the room. He pulled out drawers, opened cupboards,\r\ncompletely unmade the bed, and tapped the floor. Mr. Opalsen looked\r\non sceptically.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou really think you will find them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir. It stands to reason. She hadn\u2019t time to take them out\r\nof the room. The lady\u2019s discovering the robbery so soon upset her\r\nplans. No, they\u2019re here right enough. One of the two must have\r\nhidden them\u2014and it\u2019s very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done\r\nso.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMore than unlikely\u2014impossible!\u201d said Poirot quietly.\r\n\r\n\u201cEh?\u201d The inspector stared.\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled modestly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will demonstrate. Hastings, my good friend, take my watch in\r\nyour hand\u2014with care. It is a family heirloom! Just now I timed\r\nMademoiselle\u2019s movements\u2014her first absence from the room was of\r\ntwelve seconds, her second of fifteen. Now observe my actions.\r\nMadame will have the kindness to give me the key of the jewel-case.\r\nI thank you. My friend Hastings will have the kindness to say\r\n\u2018Go!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGo!\u201d I said.\r\n\r\nWith almost incredible swiftness, Poirot wrenched open the drawer\r\nof the dressing-table, extracted the jewel-case, fitted the key in\r\nthe lock, opened the case, selected a piece of jewellery, shut and\r\nlocked the case, and returned it to the drawer, which he pushed to\r\nagain. His movements were like lightning.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, _mon ami_?\u201d he demanded of me breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\u201cForty-six seconds,\u201d I replied.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see?\u201d He looked round. \u201cThere would not have been time for\r\nthe chambermaid even to take the necklace out, far less hide it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen that settles it on the maid,\u201d said the inspector with\r\nsatisfaction, and returned to his search. He passed into the maid\u2019s\r\nbedroom next door.\r\n\r\nPoirot was frowning thoughtfully. Suddenly he shot a question at\r\nMr. Opalsen.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis necklace\u2014it was, without doubt, insured?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Opalsen looked a trifle surprised at the question.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said hesitatingly, \u201cthat is so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what does that matter?\u201d broke in Mrs. Opalsen tearfully. \u201cIt\u2019s\r\nmy necklace I want. It was unique. No money could be the same.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI comprehend, madame,\u201d said Poirot soothingly. \u201cI comprehend\r\nperfectly. To _la femme_ sentiment is everything\u2014is it not so? But\r\nmonsieur, who has not the so fine susceptibility, will doubtless\r\nfind some slight consolation in the fact.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d said Mr. Opalsen rather uncertainly.\r\n\u201cStill\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by a shout of triumph from the inspector. He\r\ncame in dangling something from his fingers.\r\n\r\nWith a cry, Mrs. Opalsen heaved herself up from her chair. She was\r\na changed woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, oh, my necklace!\u201d\r\n\r\nShe clasped it to her breast with both hands. We crowded round.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere was it?\u201d demanded Opalsen.\r\n\r\n\u201cMaid\u2019s bed. In among the springs of the wire mattress. She must\r\nhave stolen it and hidden it there before the chambermaid arrived\r\non the scene.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou permit, madame?\u201d said Poirot gently. He took the necklace from\r\nher and examined it closely; then handed it back with a bow.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid, madam, you\u2019ll have to hand it over to us for the time\r\nbeing,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cWe shall want it for the charge. But\r\nit shall be returned to you as soon as possible.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Opalsen frowned.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that necessary?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so, sir. Just a formality.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, let him take it, Ed!\u201d cried his wife. \u201cI\u2019d feel safer if he\r\ndid. I shouldn\u2019t sleep a wink thinking some one else might try and\r\nget hold of it. That wretched girl! And I would never have believed\r\nit of her.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, don\u2019t take on so.\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt a gentle pressure on my arm. It was Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cShall we slip away, my friend? I think our services are no longer\r\nneeded.\u201d\r\n\r\nOnce outside, however, he hesitated, and then, much to my surprise,\r\nhe remarked:\r\n\r\n\u201cI should rather like to see the room next door.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe door was not locked, and we entered. The room, which was a\r\nlarge double one, was unoccupied. Dust lay about rather noticeably,\r\nand my sensitive friend gave a characteristic grimace as he ran\r\nhis finger round a rectangular mark on a table near the window.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe _service_ leaves to be desired,\u201d he observed dryly.\r\n\r\nHe was staring thoughtfully out of the window, and seemed to have\r\nfallen into a brown study.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d I demanded impatiently. \u201cWhat did we come in here for?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe started.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Je vous demande pardon, mon ami_. I wished to see if the door\r\nwas really bolted on this side also.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, glancing at the door which communicated with the\r\nroom we had just left, \u201cit _is_ bolted.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded. He still seemed to be thinking.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd, anyway,\u201d I continued, \u201cwhat does it matter? The case is over.\r\nI wish you\u2019d had more chance of distinguishing yourself. But it\r\nwas the kind of case that even a stiff-backed idiot like that\r\ninspector couldn\u2019t go wrong over.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe case is not over, my friend. It will not be over until we find\r\nout who stole the pearls.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the maid did!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d I stammered, \u201cthey were found\u2014actually in her mattress.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTa, ta, ta!\u201d said Poirot impatiently. \u201cThose were not the pearls.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cImitation, _mon ami_.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe statement took my breath away. Poirot was smiling placidly.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels. But presently\r\nthere will be a fine hullabaloo!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome!\u201d I cried, dragging at his arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must tell the Opalsens at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI think not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut that poor woman\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien_; that poor woman, as you call her, will have a much\r\nbetter night believing the jewels to be safe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the thief may escape with them!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs usual, my friend, you speak without reflection. How do you know\r\nthat the pearls Mrs. Opalsen locked up so carefully to-night were\r\nnot the false ones, and that the real robbery did not take place\r\nat a much earlier date?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d I said, bewildered.\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Poirot, beaming. \u201cWe start again.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe led the way out of the room, paused a moment as though\r\nconsidering, and then walked down to the end of the corridor,\r\nstopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets\r\nof the respective floors congregated. Our particular chambermaid\r\nappeared to be holding a small court there, and to be retailing\r\nher late experiences to an appreciative audience. She stopped in\r\nthe middle of a sentence. Poirot bowed with his usual politeness.\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse that I derange you, but I shall be obliged if you will\r\nunlock for me the door of Mr. Opalsen\u2019s room.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe woman rose willingly, and we accompanied her down the passage\r\nagain. Mr. Opalsen\u2019s room was on the other side of the corridor,\r\nits door facing that of his wife\u2019s room. The chambermaid unlocked\r\nit with her pass-key, and we entered.\r\n\r\nAs she was about to depart Poirot detained her.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne moment; have you ever seen among the effects of Mr. Opalsen\r\na card like this?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held out a plain white card, rather highly glazed and uncommon\r\nin appearance. The maid took it and scrutinized it carefully.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, I can\u2019t say I have. But, anyway, the valet has most to\r\ndo with the gentlemen\u2019s rooms.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see. Thank you.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot took back the card. The woman departed. Poirot appeared to\r\nreflect a little. Then he gave a short, sharp nod of the head.\r\n\r\n\u201cRing the bell, I pray of you, Hastings. Three times, for the\r\nvalet.\u201d\r\n\r\nI obeyed, devoured with curiosity. Meanwhile Poirot had emptied\r\nthe waste-paper-basket on the floor, and was swiftly going through\r\nits contents.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the valet answered the bell. To him Poirot put\r\nthe same question, and handed him the card to examine. But the\r\nresponse was the same. The valet had never seen a card of that\r\nparticular quality among Mr. Opalsen\u2019s belongings. Poirot thanked\r\nhim, and he withdrew, somewhat unwillingly, with an inquisitive\r\nglance at the overturned waste-paper-basket and the litter on the\r\nfloor. He could hardly have helped overhearing Poirot\u2019s thoughtful\r\nremark as he bundled the torn papers back again:\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the necklace was heavily insured. . . .\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I cried,  \u201cI see\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou see nothing, my friend,\u201d he replied quickly. \u201cAs usual,\r\nnothing at all! It is incredible\u2014but there it is. Let us return to\r\nour own apartments.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe did so in silence. Once there, to my intense surprise, Poirot\r\neffected a rapid change of clothing.\r\n\r\n\u201cI go to London to-night,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt is imperative.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbsolutely. The real work, that of the brain (ah, those brave\r\nlittle grey cells), it is done. I go to seek the confirmation. I\r\nshall find it! Impossible to deceive Hercule Poirot!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll come a cropper one of these days,\u201d I observed, rather\r\ndisgusted by his vanity.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not be enraged, I beg of you, _mon ami_. I count on you to do\r\nme a service\u2014of your friendship.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said eagerly, rather ashamed of my moroseness. \u201cWhat\r\nis it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe sleeve of my coat that I have taken off\u2014will you brush it?\r\nSee you, a little white powder has clung to it. You without doubt\r\nobserved me run my finger round the drawer of the dressing-table?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou should observe my actions, my friend. Thus I obtained the\r\npowder on my finger, and, being a little over-excited, I rubbed it\r\non my sleeve; an action without method which I deplore\u2014false to\r\nall my principles.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what was the powder?\u201d I asked, not particularly interested in\r\nPoirot\u2019s principles.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot the poison of the Borgias,\u201d replied Poirot, with a twinkle.\r\n\u201cI see your imagination mounting. I should say it was French\r\nchalk.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrench chalk?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, cabinet-makers use it to make drawers run smoothly.\u201d\r\n\r\nI laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou old sinner! I thought you were working up to something\r\nexciting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAu revoir, my friend. I save myself. I fly!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe door shut behind him. With a smile, half of derision, half of\r\naffection, I picked up the coat, and stretched out my hand for the\r\nclothes-brush.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, hearing nothing from Poirot, I went out for a\r\nstroll, met some old friends, and lunched with them at their hotel.\r\nIn the afternoon we went for a spin. A punctured tyre delayed us,\r\nand it was past eight when I got back to the _Grand Metropolitan_.\r\n\r\nThe first sight that met my eyes was Poirot, looking even more\r\ndiminutive than usual, sandwiched between the Opalsens, beaming in\r\na state of placid satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon ami_ Hastings!\u201d he cried, and sprang to meet me. \u201cEmbrace\r\nme, my friend; all has marched to a marvel!\u201d\r\n\r\nLuckily, the embrace was merely figurative\u2014not a thing one is\r\nalways sure of with Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean\u2014\u2014\u201d I began.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust wonderful, I call it!\u201d said Mrs. Opalsen, smiling all over\r\nher fat face. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you, Ed, that if he couldn\u2019t get back\r\nmy pearls nobody would?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did, my dear, you did. And you were right.\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked helplessly at Poirot, and he answered the glance.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy friend Hastings is, as you say in England, all at the seaside.\r\nSeat yourself, and I will recount to you all the affair that has\r\nso happily ended.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEnded?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut yes. They are arrested.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWho are arrested?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe chambermaid and the valet, _parbleu_! You did not suspect?\r\nNot with my parting hint about the French chalk?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou said cabinet-makers used it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly they do\u2014to make drawers slide easily. Somebody wanted\r\nthat drawer to slide in and out without any noise. Who could that\r\nbe? Obviously, only the chambermaid. The plan was so ingenious that\r\nit did not at once leap to the eye\u2014not even to the eye of Hercule\r\nPoirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cListen, this was how it was done. The valet was in the empty room\r\nnext door, waiting. The French maid leaves the room. Quick as a\r\nflash the chambermaid whips open the drawer, takes out the\r\njewel-case, and, slipping back the bolt, passes it through the\r\ndoor. The valet opens it at his leisure with the duplicate key with\r\nwhich he has provided himself, extracts the necklace, and waits\r\nhis time. C\u00e9lestine leaves the room again, and\u2014pst!\u2014in a flash the\r\ncase is passed back again and replaced in the drawer.\r\n\r\n\u201cMadame arrives, the theft is discovered. The chambermaid demands\r\nto be searched, with a good deal of righteous indignation, and\r\nleaves the room without a stain on her character. The imitation\r\nnecklace with which they have provided themselves has been concealed\r\nin the French girl\u2019s bed that morning by the chambermaid\u2014a master\r\nstroke, _\u00e7a!_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what did you go to London for?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou remember the card?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. It puzzled me\u2014and puzzles me still. I thought\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nI hesitated delicately, glancing at Mr. Opalsen.\r\n\r\nPoirot laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Une blague!_ For the benefit of the valet. The card was one with\r\na specially prepared surface\u2014for finger-prints. I went straight\r\nto Scotland Yard, asked for our old friend Inspector Japp, and laid\r\nthe facts before him. As I had suspected, the finger-prints proved\r\nto be those of two well-known jewel thieves who have been \u2018wanted\u2019\r\nfor some time. Japp came down with me, the thieves were arrested,\r\nand the necklace was discovered in the valet\u2019s possession. A clever\r\npair, but they failed in _method_. Have I not told you, Hastings,\r\nat least thirty-six times, that without method\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt least thirty-six thousand times!\u201d I interrupted. \u201cBut where\r\ndid their \u2018method\u2019 break down?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon ami_, it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or\r\nvalet\u2014but you must not shirk your work. They left an empty room\r\nundusted; and therefore, when the man put down the jewel-case on\r\nthe little table near the communicating door, it left a square\r\nmark\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI remember,\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore, I was undecided. Then\u2014I _knew_!\u201d There was a moment\u2019s\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve got my pearls,\u201d said Mrs. Opalsen as a sort of Greek\r\nchorus.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019d better have some dinner.\u201d Poirot accompanied\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis ought to mean kudos for you,\u201d I observed.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Pas du tout_,\u201d replied Poirot tranquilly. \u201cJapp and the local\r\ninspector will divide the credit between them. But\u201d\u2014he tapped his\r\npocket\u2014\u201cI have a cheque here, from Mr. Opalsen, and, how say you,\r\nmy friend? This week-end has not gone according to plan. Shall we\r\nreturn here next week-end\u2014at my expense this time?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  VIII\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Kidnapped Prime Minister\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that war and the problems of war are things of the past, I\r\nthink I may safely venture to reveal to the world the part which\r\nmy friend Poirot played in a moment of national crisis. The secret\r\nhas been well guarded. Not a whisper of it reached the Press. But,\r\nnow that the need for secrecy has gone by, I feel it is only just\r\nthat England should know the debt it owes to my quaint little\r\nfriend, whose marvellous brain so ably averted a great catastrophe.\r\n\r\nOne evening after dinner\u2014I will not particularize the date; it\r\nsuffices to say that it was at the time when \u201cPeace by negotiation\u201d\r\nwas the parrot-cry of England\u2019s enemies\u2014my friend and I were\r\nsitting in his rooms. After being invalided out of the Army I had\r\nbeen given a recruiting job, and it had become my custom to drop\r\nin on Poirot in the evenings after dinner and talk with him of any\r\ncases of interest that he might have on hand.\r\n\r\nI was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that\r\nday\u2014no less than an attempted assassination of Mr. David MacAdam,\r\nEngland\u2019s Prime Minister. The account in the papers had evidently\r\nbeen carefully censored. No details were given, save that the Prime\r\nMinister had had a marvellous escape, the bullet just grazing his\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\nI considered that our police must have been shamefully careless\r\nfor such an outrage to be possible. I could well understand that\r\nthe German agents in England would be willing to risk much for such\r\nan achievement. \u201cFighting Mac,\u201d as his own party had nicknamed him,\r\nhad strenuously and unequivocally combated the Pacifist influence\r\nwhich was becoming so prevalent.\r\n\r\nHe was more than England\u2019s Prime Minister\u2014he _was_ England; and\r\nto have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been\r\na crushing and paralysing blow to Britain.\r\n\r\nPoirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge. Never\r\nwas there a dandy such as Hercule Poirot. Neatness and order were\r\nhis passion. Now, with the odour of benzine filling the air, he\r\nwas quite unable to give me his full attention.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn a little minute I am with you, my friend. I have all but\r\nfinished. The spot of grease\u2014he is not good\u2014I remove him\u2014so!\u201d He\r\nwaved his sponge.\r\n\r\nI smiled as I lit another cigarette.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnything interesting on?\u201d I inquired, after a minute or two.\r\n\r\n\u201cI assist a\u2014how do you call it?\u2014\u2018charlady\u2019 to find her husband. A\r\ndifficult affair, needing the tact. For I have a little idea that\r\nwhen he is found he will not be pleased. What would you? For my\r\npart, I sympathize with him. He was a man of discrimination to lose\r\nhimself.\u201d\r\n\r\nI laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt last! The spot of grease, he is gone! I am at your disposal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was asking you what you thought of this attempt to assassinate\r\nMacAdam?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Enfantillage!_\u201d replied Poirot promptly. \u201cOne can hardly take it\r\nseriously. To fire with the rifle\u2014never does it succeed. It is a\r\ndevice of the past.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was very near succeeding this time,\u201d I reminded him.\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head impatiently. He was about to reply when the\r\nlandlady thrust her head round the door and informed him that there\r\nwere two gentlemen below who wanted to see him.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey won\u2019t give their names, sir, but they says as it\u2019s very\r\nimportant.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet them mount,\u201d said Poirot, carefully folding his grey trousers.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in, and my heart\r\ngave a leap as in the foremost I recognized no less a personage\r\nthan Lord Estair, Leader of the House of Commons; whilst his\r\ncompanion, Mr. Bernard Dodge, was also a member of the War Cabinet,\r\nand, as I knew, a close personal friend of the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur Poirot?\u201d said Lord Estair interrogatively. My friend\r\nbowed. The great man looked at me and hesitated. \u201cMy business is\r\nprivate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may speak freely before Captain Hastings,\u201d said my friend,\r\nnodding to me to remain. \u201cHe has not all the gifts, no! But I\r\nanswer for his discretion.\u201d\r\n\r\nLord Estair still hesitated, but Mr. Dodge broke in abruptly:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, come on\u2014don\u2019t let\u2019s beat about the bush! As far as I can see,\r\nthe whole of England will know the hole we\u2019re in soon enough.\r\nTime\u2019s everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPray be seated, messieurs,\u201d said Poirot politely. \u201cWill you take\r\nthe big chair, _milord_?\u201d\r\n\r\nLord Estair started slightly. \u201cYou know me?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled. \u201cCertainly. I read the little papers with the\r\npictures. How should I not know you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur Poirot, I have come to consult you upon a matter of the\r\nmost vital urgency. I must ask for absolute secrecy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have the word of Hercule Poirot\u2014I can say no more!\u201d said my\r\nfriend grandiloquently.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt concerns the Prime Minister. We are in grave trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re up a tree!\u201d interposed Mr. Dodge.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe injury is serious, then?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat injury?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe bullet wound.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that!\u201d cried Mr. Dodge contemptuously. \u201cThat\u2019s old history.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs my colleague says,\u201d continued Lord Estair, \u201cthat affair is over\r\nand done with. Luckily, it failed. I wished I could say as much\r\nfor the second attempt.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere has been a second attempt, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, though not of the same nature. Monsieur Poirot, the Prime\r\nMinister has disappeared.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe has been kidnapped!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cImpossible!\u201d I cried, stupefied.\r\n\r\nPoirot threw a withering glance at me, which I knew enjoined me to\r\nkeep my mouth shut.\r\n\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, impossible as it seems, it is only too true,\u201d\r\ncontinued his lordship.\r\n\r\nPoirot looked at Mr. Dodge. \u201cYou said just now, monsieur, that time\r\nwas everything. What did you mean by that?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two men exchanged glances, and then Lord Estair said:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have heard, Monsieur Poirot, of the approaching Allied\r\nConference?\u201d\r\n\r\nMy friend nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor obvious reasons, no details have been given of when and where\r\nit is to take place. But, although it has been kept out of the\r\nnewspapers, the date is, of course, widely known in diplomatic\r\ncircles. The Conference is to be held to-morrow\u2014Thursday\u2014evening\r\nat Versailles. Now you perceive the terrible gravity of the\r\nsituation. I will not conceal from you that the Prime Minister\u2019s\r\npresence at the Conference is a vital necessity. The Pacifist\r\npropaganda, started and maintained by the German agents in our\r\nmidst, has been very active. It is the universal opinion that the\r\nturning point of the Conference will be the strong personality of\r\nthe Prime Minister. His absence may have the most serious\r\nresults\u2014possibly a premature and disastrous peace. And we have no\r\none who can be sent in his place. He alone can represent England.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot\u2019s face had grown very grave. \u201cThen you regard the kidnapping\r\nof the Prime Minister as a direct attempt to prevent his being\r\npresent at the Conference?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMost certainly I do. He was actually on his way to France at the\r\ntime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the Conference is to be held?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt nine o\u2019clock to-morrow night.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot drew an enormous watch from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is now a quarter to nine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTwenty-four hours,\u201d said Mr. Dodge thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd a quarter,\u201d amended Poirot. \u201cDo not forget the quarter,\r\nmonsieur\u2014it may come in useful. Now for the details\u2014the abduction,\r\ndid it take place in England or in France?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn France. Mr. MacAdam crossed to France this morning. He was to\r\nstay to-night as the guest of the Commander-in-Chief, proceeding\r\nto-morrow to Paris. He was conveyed across the Channel by destroyer.\r\nAt Boulogne he was met by a car from General Headquarters and one\r\nof the Commander-in-Chief\u2019s A.D.C.s.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien_?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, they started from Boulogne\u2014but they never arrived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur Poirot, it was a bogus car and a bogus A.D.C. The real\r\ncar was found in a side road, with the chauffeur and the A.D.C.\r\nneatly gagged and bound.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the bogus car?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs still at large.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot made a gesture of impatience. \u201cIncredible! Surely it cannot\r\nescape attention for long?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo we thought. It seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly.\r\nThat part of France is under Military Law. We were convinced that\r\nthe car could not go long unnoticed. The French police and our own\r\nScotland Yard men, and the military are straining every nerve. It\r\nis, as you say, incredible\u2014but nothing has been discovered!\u201d\r\n\r\nAt that moment a tap came at the door, and a young officer entered\r\nwith a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to Lord Estair.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust through from France, sir. I brought it on here, as you\r\ndirected.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Minister tore it open eagerly, and uttered an exclamation. The\r\nofficer withdrew.\r\n\r\n\u201cHere is news at last! This telegram has just been decoded. They\r\nhave found the second car, also the secretary, Daniels, chloroformed,\r\ngagged, and bound, in an abandoned farm near C\u2014\u2014. He remembers\r\nnothing, except something being pressed against his mouth and nose\r\nfrom behind, and struggling to free himself. The police are\r\nsatisfied as to the genuineness of his statement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd they have found nothing else?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot the Prime Minister\u2019s dead body? Then, there is hope. But it\r\nis strange. Why, after trying to shoot him this morning, are they\r\nnow taking so much trouble to keep him alive?\u201d\r\n\r\nDodge shook his head. \u201cOne thing\u2019s quite certain. They\u2019re determined\r\nat all costs to prevent his attending the Conference.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf it is humanly possible, the Prime Minister shall be there. God\r\ngrant it is not too late. Now, messieurs, recount to me\r\neverything\u2014from the beginning. I must know about this shooting\r\naffair as well.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLast night, the Prime Minister, accompanied by one of his\r\nsecretaries, Captain Daniels\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe same who accompanied him to France?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. As I was saying, they motored down to Windsor, where the\r\nPrime Minister was granted an Audience. Early this morning, he\r\nreturned to town, and it was on the way that the attempted\r\nassassination took place.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne moment, if you please. Who is this Captain Daniels? You have\r\nhis dossier?\u201d\r\n\r\nLord Estair smiled. \u201cI thought you would ask me that. We do not\r\nknow very much of him. He is of no particular family. He has served\r\nin the English Army, and is an extremely able secretary, being an\r\nexceptionally fine linguist. I believe he speaks seven languages.\r\nIt is for that reason that the Prime Minister chose him to accompany\r\nhim to France.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas he any relatives in England?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo aunts. A Mrs. Everard, who lives at Hampstead, and a Miss\r\nDaniels, who lives near Ascot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAscot? That is near to Windsor, is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat point has not been overlooked. But it has led to nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou regard the Capitaine Daniels, then, as above suspicion?\u201d\r\n\r\nA shade of bitterness crept into Lord Estair\u2019s voice, as he replied:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, Monsieur Poirot. In these days, I should hesitate before I\r\npronounced _anyone_ above suspicion.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Tr\u00e8s bien_. Now I understand, _milord_, that the Prime Minister\r\nwould, as a matter of course, be under vigilant police protection,\r\nwhich ought to render any assault upon him an impossibility?\u201d\r\n\r\nLord Estair bowed his head. \u201cThat is so. The Prime Minister\u2019s car\r\nwas closely followed by another car containing detectives in plain\r\nclothes. Mr. MacAdam knew nothing of these precautions. He is\r\npersonally a most fearless man, and would be inclined to sweep them\r\naway arbitrarily. But, naturally, the police make their own\r\narrangements. In fact, the Premier\u2019s chauffeur, O\u2019Murphy, is a\r\nC.I.D. man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cO\u2019Murphy? That is a name of Ireland, is it not so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, he is an Irishman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom what part of Ireland?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCounty Clare, I believe.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Tiens!_ But proceed, _milord_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Premier started for London. The car was a closed one. He and\r\nCaptain Daniels sat inside. The second car followed as usual. But,\r\nunluckily, for some unknown reason, the Prime Minister\u2019s car\r\ndeviated from the main road\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAt a point where the road curves?\u201d interrupted Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes\u2014but how did you know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, _c\u2019est \u00e9vident_! Continue!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor some unknown reason,\u201d continued Lord Estair, \u201cthe Premier\u2019s\r\ncar left the main road. The police car, unaware of the deviation,\r\ncontinued to keep to the high road. At a short distance down the\r\nunfrequented lane, the Prime Minister\u2019s car was suddenly held up\r\nby a band of masked men. The chauffeur\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat brave O\u2019Murphy!\u201d murmured Poirot thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe chauffeur, momentarily taken aback, jammed on the brakes. The\r\nPrime Minister put his head out of the window. Instantly a shot\r\nrang out\u2014then another. The first one grazed his cheek, the second,\r\nfortunately, went wide. The chauffeur, now realizing the danger,\r\ninstantly forged straight ahead, scattering the band of men.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA near escape,\u201d I ejaculated, with a shiver.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. MacAdam refused to make any fuss over the slight wound he had\r\nreceived. He declared it was only a scratch. He stopped at a local\r\ncottage hospital, where it was dressed and bound up\u2014he did not, of\r\ncourse, reveal his identity. He then drove, as per schedule,\r\nstraight to Charing Cross, where a special train for Dover was\r\nawaiting him, and, after a brief account of what had happened had\r\nbeen given to the anxious police by Captain Daniels, he duly\r\ndeparted for France. At Dover, he went on board the waiting\r\ndestroyer. At Boulogne, as you know, the bogus car was waiting for\r\nhim, carrying the Union Jack, and correct in every detail.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is all you have to tell me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no other circumstance that you have omitted, milord?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, there is one rather peculiar thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Prime Minister\u2019s car did not return home after leaving the\r\nPrime Minister at Charing Cross. The police were anxious to\r\ninterview O\u2019Murphy, so a search was instituted at once. The car\r\nwas discovered standing outside a certain unsavoury little\r\nrestaurant in Soho, which is well known as a meeting-place of\r\nGerman agents.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the chauffeur?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe chauffeur was nowhere to be found. He, too, had disappeared.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully, \u201cthere are two disappearances: the\r\nPrime Minister in France, and O\u2019Murphy in London.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe looked keenly at Lord Estair, who made a gesture of despair.\r\n\r\n\u201cI can only tell you, Monsieur Poirot, that, if anyone had suggested\r\nto me yesterday that O\u2019Murphy was a traitor, I should have laughed\r\nin his face.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd to-day?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo-day I do not know what to think.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded gravely. He looked at his turnip of a watch again.\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand that I have carte blanche, messieurs\u2014in every way,\r\nI mean? I must be able to go where I choose, and how I choose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerfectly. There is a special train leaving for Dover in an hour\u2019s\r\ntime, with a further contingent from Scotland Yard. You shall be\r\naccompanied by a Military officer and a C.I.D. man, who will hold\r\nthemselves at your disposal in every way. Is that satisfactory?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite. One more question before you leave, messieurs. What made\r\nyou come to me? I am unknown, obscure, in this great London of\r\nyours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe sought you out on the express recommendation and wish of a very\r\ngreat man of your own country.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Comment?_ My old friend the _Pr\u00e9fet_\u2014\u2014?\u201d\r\n\r\nLord Estair shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne higher than the _Pr\u00e9fet_. One whose word was once law in\r\nBelgium\u2014and shall be again! That England has sworn!\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot\u2019s hand flew swiftly to a dramatic salute. \u201cAmen to that!\r\nAh, but my Master does not forget. . . . Messieurs, I, Hercule\r\nPoirot, will serve you faithfully. Heaven only send that it will\r\nbe in time. But this is dark\u2014dark. . . . I cannot see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Poirot,\u201d I cried impatiently, as the door closed behind the\r\nMinisters, \u201cwhat do you think?\u201d\r\n\r\nMy friend was busy packing a minute suitcase, with quick, deft\r\nmovements. He shook his head thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not know what to think. My brains desert me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, as you said, kidnap him, when a knock on the head would do\r\nas well?\u201d I mused.\r\n\r\n\u201cPardon me, _mon ami_, but I did not quite say that. It is\r\nundoubtedly far more their affair to kidnap him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause uncertainty creates panic. That is one reason. Were the\r\nPrime Minister dead, it would be a terrible calamity, but the\r\nsituation would have to be faced. But now you have paralysis. Will\r\nthe Prime Minister reappear, or will he not? Is he dead or alive?\r\nNobody knows, and until they know nothing definite can be done.\r\nAnd, as I tell you, uncertainty breeds panic, which is what _les\r\nBoches_ are playing for. Then, again, if the kidnappers are holding\r\nhim secretly somewhere, they have the advantage of being able to\r\nmake terms with both sides. The German Government is not a liberal\r\npaymaster, as a rule, but no doubt they can be made to disgorge\r\nsubstantial remittances in such a case as this. Thirdly, they run\r\nno risk of the hangman\u2019s rope. Oh, decidedly, kidnapping is their\r\naffair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, if that is so, why should they first try to shoot him?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot made a gesture of anger. \u201cAh, that is just what I do not\r\nunderstand! It is inexplicable\u2014stupid! They have all their\r\narrangements made (and very good arrangements too!) for the\r\nabduction, and yet they imperil the whole affair by a melodramatic\r\nattack, worthy of a Cinema, and quite as unreal. It is almost\r\nimpossible to believe in it, with its band of masked men, not\r\ntwenty miles from London!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps they were two quite separate attempts which happened\r\nirrespective of each other,\u201d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, no, that would be too much of a coincidence! Then, further\u2014who\r\nis the traitor? There must have been a traitor\u2014in the first affair,\r\nanyway. But who was it\u2014Daniels or O\u2019Murphy? It must have been one\r\nof the two, or why did the car leave the main road? We cannot\r\nsuppose that the Prime Minister connived at his own assassination!\r\nDid O\u2019Murphy take that turning of his own accord, or was it Daniels\r\nwho told him to do so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSurely it must have been O\u2019Murphy\u2019s doing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, because if it was Daniels\u2019 the Prime Minister would have\r\nheard the order, and would have asked the reason. But there are\r\naltogether too many \u2018whys\u2019 in this affair, and they contradict each\r\nother. If O\u2019Murphy is an honest man, _why_ did he leave the main\r\nroad? But if he was a dishonest man, _why_ did he start the car\r\nagain when only two shots had been fired\u2014thereby, in all probability,\r\nsaving the Prime Minister\u2019s life? And, again, if he was honest,\r\nwhy did he, immediately on leaving Charing Cross, drive to a\r\nwell-known rendezvous of German spies?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt looks bad,\u201d I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us look at the case with method. What have we for and against\r\nthese two men? Take O\u2019Murphy first. Against: that his conduct in\r\nleaving the main road was suspicious; that he is an Irishman from\r\nCounty Clare; that he has disappeared in a highly suggestive\r\nmanner. For: that his promptness in restarting the car saved the\r\nPremier\u2019s life; that he is a Scotland Yard man, and, obviously,\r\nfrom the post allotted to him, a trusted detective. Now for Daniels.\r\nThere is not much against him, except the fact that nothing is\r\nknown of his antecedents, and that he speaks too many languages\r\nfor a good Englishman! (Pardon me, _mon ami_, but, as linguists,\r\nyou are deplorable!) _Now for him_, we have the fact that he was\r\nfound gagged, bound, and chloroformed\u2014which does not look as though\r\nhe had anything to do with the matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe might have gagged and bound himself, to divert suspicion.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head. \u201cThe French police would make no mistake of\r\nthat kind. Besides, once he had attained his object, and the Prime\r\nMinister was safely abducted, there would not be much point in his\r\nremaining behind. His accomplices _could_ have gagged and\r\nchloroformed him, of course, but I fail to see what object they\r\nhoped to accomplish by it. He can be of little use to them now,\r\nfor, until the circumstances concerning the Prime Minister have\r\nbeen cleared up, he is bound to be closely watched.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps he hoped to start the police on a false scent?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen why did he not do so? He merely says that something was\r\npressed over his nose and mouth, and that he remembers nothing\r\nmore. There is no false scent there. It sounds remarkably like the\r\ntruth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, glancing at the clock, \u201cI suppose we\u2019d better start\r\nfor the station. You may find more clues in France.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPossibly, _mon ami_, but I doubt it. It is still incredible to me\r\nthat the Prime Minister has not been discovered in that limited\r\narea, where the difficulty of concealing him must be tremendous.\r\nIf the military and the police of two countries have not found him,\r\nhow shall I?\u201d\r\n\r\nAt Charing Cross we were met by Mr. Dodge.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is Detective Barnes, of Scotland Yard, and Major Norman. They\r\nwill hold themselves entirely at your disposal. Good luck to you.\r\nIt\u2019s a bad business, but I\u2019ve not given up hope. Must be off now.\u201d\r\nAnd the Minister strode rapidly away.\r\n\r\nWe chatted in a desultory fashion with Major Norman. In the centre\r\nof the little group of men on the platform I recognized a little\r\nferret-faced fellow talking to a tall, fair man. He was an old\r\nacquaintance of Poirot\u2019s\u2014Detective-Inspector Japp, supposed to be\r\none of the smartest of Scotland Yard\u2019s officers. He came over and\r\ngreeted my friend cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cI heard you were on this job too. Smart bit of work. So far\r\nthey\u2019ve got away with the goods all right. But I can\u2019t believe they\r\ncan keep him hidden long. Our people are going through France with\r\na toothcomb. So are the French. I can\u2019t help feeling it\u2019s only a\r\nmatter of hours now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is, if he\u2019s still alive,\u201d remarked the tall detective\r\ngloomily.\r\n\r\nJapp\u2019s face fell. \u201cYes. . . . But somehow I\u2019ve got the feeling he\u2019s\r\nalive all right.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded. \u201cYes, yes; he\u2019s alive. But can he be found in time?\r\nI, like you, did not believe he could be hidden so long.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe whistle blew, and we all trooped up into the Pullman car. Then,\r\nwith a slow, unwilling jerk, the train drew out of the station.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious journey. The Scotland Yard men crowded together.\r\nMaps of Northern France were spread out, and eager forefingers\r\ntraced the lines of roads and villages. Each man had his own pet\r\ntheory. Poirot showed none of his usual loquacity, but sat staring\r\nin front of him, with an expression on his face that reminded me\r\nof a puzzled child. I talked to Norman, whom I found quite an\r\namusing fellow. On arriving at Dover Poirot\u2019s behaviour moved me\r\nto intense amusement. The little man, as he went on board the boat,\r\nclutched desperately at my arm. The wind was blowing lustily.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon Dieu!_\u201d he murmured. \u201cThis is terrible!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave courage, Poirot,\u201d I cried. \u201cYou will succeed. You will find\r\nhim. I am sure of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, _mon ami_, you mistake my emotion. It is this villainous sea\r\nthat troubles me! The _mal de mer_\u2014it is horrible suffering!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d I said, rather taken aback.\r\n\r\nThe first throb of the engines was felt, and Poirot groaned and\r\nclosed his eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cMajor Norman has a map of Northern France if you would like to\r\nstudy it?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut no, but no! Leave me, my friend. See you, to think, the\r\nstomach and the brain must be in harmony. Laverguier has a method\r\nmost excellent for averting the _mal de mer_. You breathe in\u2014and\r\nout\u2014slowly, so\u2014turning the head from left to right and counting\r\nsix between each breath.\u201d\r\n\r\nI left him to his gymnastic endeavours, and went on deck.\r\n\r\nAs we came slowly into Boulogne Harbour Poirot appeared, neat and\r\nsmiling, and announced to me in a whisper that Laverguier\u2019s system\r\nhad succeeded \u201cto a marvel!\u201d\r\n\r\nJapp\u2019s forefinger was still tracing imaginary routes on his map.\r\n\u201cNonsense! The car started from Boulogne\u2014here they branched off.\r\nNow, my idea is that they transferred the Prime Minister to another\r\ncar. See?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the tall detective, \u201cI shall make for the seaports.\r\nTen to one, they\u2019ve smuggled him on board a ship.\u201d\r\n\r\nJapp shook his head. \u201cToo obvious. The order went out at once to\r\nclose all the ports.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe day was just breaking as we landed. Major Norman touched Poirot\r\non the arm. \u201cThere\u2019s a military car here waiting for you, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, monsieur. But, for the moment, I do not propose to\r\nleave Boulogne.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, we will enter this hotel here, by the quay.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe suited the action to the word, demanded and was accorded a\r\nprivate room. We three followed him, puzzled and uncomprehending.\r\n\r\nHe shot a quick glance at us. \u201cIt is not so that the good detective\r\nshould act, eh? I perceive your thought. He must be full of energy.\r\nHe must rush to and fro. He should prostrate himself on the dusty\r\nroad and seek the marks of tyres through a little glass. He must\r\ngather up the cigarette-end, the fallen match? That is your idea,\r\nis it not?\u201d\r\n\r\nHis eyes challenged us. \u201cBut I\u2014Hercule Poirot\u2014tell you that it is\r\nnot so! The true clues are within\u2014_here_!\u201d He tapped his forehead.\r\n\u201cSee you, I need not have left London. It would have been sufficient\r\nfor me to sit quietly in my rooms there. All that matters is the\r\nlittle grey cells within. Secretly and silently they do their part,\r\nuntil suddenly I call for a map, and I lay my finger on a\r\nspot\u2014so\u2014and I say: the Prime Minister is _there_! And it is so!\r\nWith method and logic one can accomplish anything! This frantic\r\nrushing to France was a mistake\u2014it is playing a child\u2019s game of\r\nhide-and-seek. But now, though it may be too late, I will set to\r\nwork the right way, from within. Silence, my friends, I beg of\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd for five long hours the little man sat motionless, blinking\r\nhis eyelids like a cat, his green eyes flickering and becoming\r\nsteadily greener and greener. The Scotland Yard man was obviously\r\ncontemptuous, Major Norman was bored and impatient, and I myself\r\nfound the time pass with wearisome slowness.\r\n\r\nFinally, I got up, and strolled as noiselessly as I could to the\r\nwindow. The matter was becoming a farce. I was secretly concerned\r\nfor my friend. If he failed, I would have preferred him to fail in\r\na less ridiculous manner. Out of the window I idly watched the\r\ndaily leave boat, belching forth columns of smoke, as she lay\r\nalongside the quay.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I was aroused by Poirot\u2019s voice close to my elbow.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mes amis_, let us start!\u201d\r\n\r\nI turned. An extraordinary transformation had come over my friend.\r\nHis eyes were flickering with excitement, his chest was swelled to\r\nthe uttermost.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been an imbecile, my friends! But I see daylight at last.\u201d\r\n\r\nMajor Norman moved hastily to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll order the car.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no need. I shall not use it. Thank Heaven the wind has\r\nfallen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean you are going to walk, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, my young friend. I am no St. Peter. I prefer to cross the sea\r\nby boat.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo cross the _sea_?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. To work with method, one must begin from the beginning. And\r\nthe beginning of this affair was in England. Therefore, we return\r\nto England.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n  \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022\r\n\r\n\r\nAt three o\u2019clock, we stood once more upon Charing Cross platform.\r\nTo all our expostulations, Poirot turned a deaf ear, and reiterated\r\nagain and again that to start at the beginning was not a waste of\r\ntime, but the only way. On the way over, he had conferred with\r\nNorman in a low voice, and the latter had despatched a sheaf of\r\ntelegrams from Dover.\r\n\r\nOwing to the special passes held by Norman, we got through\r\neverywhere in record time. In London, a large police car was\r\nwaiting for us, with some plain-clothes men, one of whom handed a\r\ntypewritten sheet of paper to my friend. He answered my inquiring\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\u201cA list of the cottage hospitals within a certain radius west of\r\nLondon. I wired for it from Dover.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe were whirled rapidly through the London streets. We were on the\r\nBath Road. On we went, through Hammersmith, Chiswick and Brentford.\r\nI began to see our objective. Through Windsor and on to Ascot. My\r\nheart gave a leap. Ascot was where Daniels had an aunt living. We\r\nwere after _him_, then, not O\u2019Murphy.\r\n\r\nWe duly stopped at the gate of a trim villa. Poirot jumped out and\r\nrang the bell. I saw a perplexed frown dimming the radiance of his\r\nface. Plainly, he was not satisfied. The bell was answered. He was\r\nushered inside. In a few moments he reappeared, and climbed into\r\nthe car with a short, sharp shake of his head. My hopes began to\r\ndie down. It was past four now. Even if he found certain evidence\r\nincriminating Daniels, what would be the good of it, unless he\r\ncould wring from some one the exact spot in France where they were\r\nholding the Prime Minister?\r\n\r\nOur return progress towards London was an interrupted one. We\r\ndeviated from the main road more than once, and occasionally\r\nstopped at a small building, which I had no difficulty in\r\nrecognizing as a cottage hospital. Poirot only spent a few minutes\r\nat each, but at every halt his radiant assurance was more and more\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nHe whispered something to Norman, to which the latter replied:\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, if you turn off to the left, you will find them waiting by\r\nthe bridge.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe turned up a side road, and in the failing light I discerned a\r\nsecond car, waiting by the side of the road. It contained two men\r\nin plain clothes. Poirot got down and spoke to them, and then we\r\nstarted off in a northerly direction, the other car following close\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nWe drove for some time, our objective being obviously one of the\r\nnorthern suburbs of London. Finally, we drove up to the front door\r\nof a tall house, standing a little back from the road in its own\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nNorman and I were left with the car. Poirot and one of the\r\ndetectives went up to the door and rang. A neat parlourmaid opened\r\nit. The detective spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am a police officer, and I have a warrant to search this house.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe girl gave a little scream, and a tall, handsome woman of\r\nmiddle-age appeared behind her in the hall.\r\n\r\n\u201cShut the door, Edith. They are burglars, I expect.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Poirot swiftly inserted his foot in the door, and at the same\r\nmoment blew a whistle. Instantly the other detectives ran up, and\r\npoured into the house, shutting the door behind them.\r\n\r\nNorman and I spent about five minutes cursing our forced inactivity.\r\nFinally the door reopened, and the men emerged, escorting three\r\nprisoners\u2014a woman and two men. The woman, and one of the men, were\r\ntaken to the second car. The other man was placed in our car by\r\nPoirot himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cI must go with the others, my friend. But have great care of this\r\ngentleman. You do not know him, no? _Eh bien_, let me present to\r\nyou, Monsieur O\u2019Murphy!\u201d\r\n\r\nO\u2019Murphy! I _gaped_ at him open-mouthed as we started again. He\r\nwas not handcuffed, but I did not fancy he would try to escape. He\r\nsat there staring in front of him as though dazed. Anyway, Norman\r\nand I would be more than a match for him.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, we still kept a northerly route. We were not\r\nreturning to London, then! I was much puzzled. Suddenly, as the\r\ncar slowed down, I recognized that we were close to Hendon\r\nAerodrome. Immediately I grasped Poirot\u2019s idea. He proposed to\r\nreach France by aeroplane.\r\n\r\nIt was a sporting idea, but, on the face of it, impracticable. A\r\ntelegram would be far quicker. Time was everything. He must leave\r\nthe personal glory of rescuing the Prime Minister to others.\r\n\r\nAs we drew up, Major Norman jumped out, and a plain-clothes man\r\ntook his place. He conferred with Poirot for a few minutes, and\r\nthen went off briskly.\r\n\r\nI, too, jumped out, and caught Poirot by the arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cI congratulate you, old fellow! They have told you the hiding-place?\r\nBut, look here, you must wire to France at once. You\u2019ll be too late\r\nif you go yourself.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot looked at me curiously for a minute or two.\r\n\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, my friend, there are some things that cannot be\r\nsent by telegram.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n  \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that moment Major Norman returned, accompanied by a young\r\nofficer in the uniform of the Flying Corps.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is Captain Lyall, who will fly you over to France. He can\r\nstart at once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWrap up warmly, sir,\u201d said the young pilot. \u201cI can lend you a\r\ncoat, if you like.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot was consulting his enormous watch. He murmured to himself:\r\n\u201cYes, there is time\u2014just time.\u201d Then he looked up, and bowed\r\npolitely to the young officer. \u201cI thank you, monsieur. But it is\r\nnot I who am your passenger. It is this gentleman here.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe moved a little aside as he spoke, and a figure came forward out\r\nof the darkness. It was the second male prisoner who had gone in\r\nthe other car, and as the light fell on his face, I gave a gasp of\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n_It was the Prime Minister!_\r\n\r\n\r\n  \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cFor Heaven\u2019s sake, tell me all about it,\u201d I cried impatiently, as\r\nPoirot, Norman, and I motored back to London. \u201cHow in the world\r\ndid they manage to smuggle him back to England?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was no need to smuggle him back,\u201d replied Poirot dryly. \u201cThe\r\nPrime Minister has never left England. He was kidnapped on his way\r\nfrom Windsor to London.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI will make all clear. The Prime Minister was in his car, his\r\nsecretary beside him. Suddenly a pad of chloroform is clapped on\r\nhis face\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut by whom?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the clever linguistic Captain Daniels. As soon as the Prime\r\nMinister is unconscious, Daniels picks up the speaking-tube, and\r\ndirects O\u2019Murphy to turn to the right, which the chauffeur, quite\r\nunsuspicious, does. A few yards down that unfrequented road, a\r\nlarge car is standing, apparently broken down. Its driver signals\r\nto O\u2019Murphy to stop. O\u2019Murphy slows up. The stranger approaches.\r\nDaniels leans out of the window, and, probably with the aid of an\r\ninstantaneous an\u00e6sthetic, such as ethylchloride, the chloroform\r\ntrick is repeated. In a few seconds, the two helpless men are\r\ndragged out and transferred to the other car, and a pair of\r\nsubstitutes take their places.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cImpossible!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Pas du tout!_ Have you not seen music-hall turns imitating\r\ncelebrities with marvellous accuracy? Nothing is easier than to\r\npersonate a public character. The Prime Minister of England is far\r\neasier to understudy than Mr. John Smith of Clapham, say. As for\r\nO\u2019Murphy\u2019s \u2018double,\u2019 no one was going to take much notice of him\r\nuntil after the departure of the Prime Minister, and by then he\r\nwould have made himself scarce. He drives straight from Charing\r\nCross to the meeting-place of his friends. He goes in as O\u2019Murphy,\r\nhe emerges as some one quite different. O\u2019Murphy has disappeared,\r\nleaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut the man who personated the Prime Minister was seen by every\r\none!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was not seen by anyone who knew him privately or intimately.\r\nAnd Daniels shielded him from contact with anyone as much as\r\npossible. Moreover, his face was bandaged up, and anything unusual\r\nin his manner would be put down to the fact that he was suffering\r\nfrom shock as a result of the attempt upon his life. Mr. MacAdam\r\nhas a weak throat, and always spares his voice as much as possible\r\nbefore any great speech. The deception was perfectly easy to keep\r\nup as far as France. There it would be impracticable and\r\nimpossible\u2014so the Prime Minister disappears. The police of this\r\ncountry hurry across the Channel, and no one bothers to go into\r\nthe details of the first attack. To sustain the illusion that the\r\nabduction has taken place in France, Daniels is gagged and\r\nchloroformed in a convincing manner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the man who has enacted the part of the Prime Minister?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRids himself of his disguise. He and the bogus chauffeur may be\r\narrested as suspicious characters, but no one will dream of\r\nsuspecting their real part in the drama, and they will eventually\r\nbe released for lack of evidence.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the real Prime Minister?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe and O\u2019Murphy were driven straight to the house of \u2018Mrs.\r\nEverard,\u2019 at Hampstead, Daniels\u2019 so-called \u2018aunt.\u2019 In reality, she\r\nis Frau Bertha Ebenthal, and the police have been looking for her\r\nfor some time. It is a valuable little present that I have made to\r\nthem\u2014to say nothing of Daniels! Ah, it was a clever plan, but he\r\ndid not reckon on the cleverness of Hercule Poirot!\u201d\r\n\r\nI think my friend might well be excused his moment of vanity.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I began to work the right way\u2014from _within_! I could not make\r\nthat shooting affair fit in\u2014but when I saw that the net result of\r\nit was that _the Prime Minister went to France with his face bound\r\nup_ I began to comprehend! And when I visited all the cottage\r\nhospitals between Windsor and London, and found that no one\r\nanswering to my description had had his face bound up and dressed\r\nthat morning, I was sure! After that, it was child\u2019s-play for a\r\nmind like mine!\u201d\r\n\r\n  \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022\r\n\r\nThe following morning, Poirot showed me a telegram he had just\r\nreceived. It had no place of origin, and was unsigned. It ran:\r\n\r\n\u201cIn time.\u201d\r\n\r\nLater in the day the evening papers published an account of the\r\nAllied Conference. They laid particular stress on the magnificent\r\novation accorded to Mr. David MacAdam, whose inspiring speech had\r\nproduced a deep and lasting impression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  IX\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Disappearance of Mr. Davenheim\r\n\r\n\r\nPoirot and I were expecting our old friend Inspector Japp of\r\nScotland Yard to tea. We were sitting round the tea-table awaiting\r\nhis arrival. Poirot had just finished carefully straightening the\r\ncups and saucers which our landlady was in the habit of throwing,\r\nrather than placing, on the table. He had also breathed heavily on\r\nthe metal teapot, and polished it with a silk handkerchief. The\r\nkettle was on the boil, and a small enamel saucepan beside it\r\ncontained some thick, sweet chocolate which was more to Poirot\u2019s\r\npalate than what he described as \u201cyour English poison.\u201d A sharp\r\n\u201crat-tat\u201d sounded below, and a few minutes afterwards Japp entered\r\nbriskly.\r\n\r\n\u201cHope I\u2019m not late,\u201d he said as he greeted us. \u201cTo tell the truth,\r\nI was yarning with Miller, the man who\u2019s in charge of the Davenheim\r\ncase.\u201d\r\n\r\nI pricked up my ears. For the last three days the papers had been\r\nfull of the strange disappearance of Mr. Davenheim, senior partner\r\nof Davenheim and Salmon, the well-known bankers and financiers. On\r\nSaturday last he had walked out of his house, and had never been\r\nseen since. I looked forward to extracting some interesting details\r\nfrom Japp.\r\n\r\n\u201cI should have thought,\u201d I remarked, \u201cthat it would be almost\r\nimpossible for anyone to \u2018disappear\u2019 nowadays.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot moved a plate of bread and butter the eighth of an inch,\r\nand said sharply:\r\n\r\n\u201cBe exact, my friend. What do you mean by \u2018disappear\u2019? To which\r\nclass of disappearance are you referring?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAre disappearances classified and labelled, then?\u201d I laughed.\r\n\r\nJapp smiled also. Poirot frowned at us both.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut certainly they are! They fall into three categories: First,\r\nand most common, the voluntary disappearance. Second, the much\r\nabused \u2018loss of memory\u2019 case\u2014rare, but occasionally genuine. Third,\r\nmurder, and a more or less successful disposal of the body. Do you\r\nrefer to all three as impossible of execution?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery nearly so, I should think. You might lose your own memory,\r\nbut some one would be sure to recognize you\u2014especially in the case\r\nof a well-known man like Davenheim. Then \u2018bodies\u2019 can\u2019t be made to\r\nvanish into thin air. Sooner or later they turn up, concealed in\r\nlonely places, or in trunks. Murder will out. In the same way, the\r\nabsconding clerk, or the domestic defaulter, is bound to be run\r\ndown in these days of wireless telegraphy. He can be headed off\r\nfrom foreign countries; ports and railway stations are watched;\r\nand, as for concealment in this country, his features and appearance\r\nwill be known to every one who reads a daily newspaper. He\u2019s up\r\nagainst civilization.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon ami_,\u201d said Poirot, \u201cyou make one error. You do not allow\r\nfor the fact that a man who had decided to make away with another\r\nman\u2014or with himself in a figurative sense\u2014might be that rare\r\nmachine, a man of method. He might bring intelligence, talent, a\r\ncareful calculation of detail to the task; and then I do not see\r\nwhy he should not be successful in baffling the police force.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut not _you_, I suppose?\u201d said Japp good-humouredly, winking at\r\nme. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t baffle _you_, eh, Monsieur Poirot?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot endeavoured, with a marked lack of success, to look modest.\r\n\u201cMe, also! Why not? It is true that I approach such problems with\r\nan exact science, a mathematical precision, which seems, alas, only\r\ntoo rare in the new generation of detectives!\u201d\r\n\r\nJapp grinned more widely.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cMiller, the man who\u2019s on this case, is\r\na smart chap. You may be very sure he won\u2019t overlook a footprint,\r\nor a cigar-ash, or a crumb even. He\u2019s got eyes that see everything.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo, _mon ami_,\u201d said Poirot, \u201chas the London sparrow. But all the\r\nsame, I should not ask the little brown bird to solve the problem\r\nof Mr. Davenheim.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome now, monsieur, you\u2019re not going to run down the value of\r\ndetails as clues?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy no means. These things are all good in their way. The danger\r\nis they may assume undue importance. Most details are insignificant;\r\none or two are vital. It is the brain, the little grey cells\u201d\u2014he\r\ntapped his forehead\u2014\u201con which one must rely. The senses mislead.\r\nOne must seek the truth within\u2014not without.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say, Monsieur Poirot, that you would undertake\r\nto solve a case without moving from your chair, do you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is exactly what I do mean\u2014granted the facts were placed\r\nbefore me. I regard myself as a consulting specialist.\u201d\r\n\r\nJapp slapped his knee. \u201cHanged if I don\u2019t take you at your word.\r\nBet you a fiver that you can\u2019t lay your hand\u2014or rather tell me\r\nwhere to lay my hand\u2014on Mr. Davenheim, dead or alive, before a week\r\nis out.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot considered. \u201c_Eh bien, mon ami_, I accept. _Le sport_, it\r\nis the passion of you English. Now\u2014the facts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn Saturday last, as is his usual custom, Mr. Davenheim took the\r\n12.40 train from Victoria to Chingside, where his palatial country\r\nplace, The Cedars, is situated. After lunch, he strolled round the\r\ngrounds, and gave various directions to the gardeners. Everybody\r\nagrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual. After\r\ntea he put his head into his wife\u2019s boudoir, saying that he was\r\ngoing to stroll down to the village and post some letters. He added\r\nthat he was expecting a Mr. Lowen, on business. If he should come\r\nbefore he himself returned, he was to be shown into the study and\r\nasked to wait. Mr. Davenheim then left the house by the front door,\r\npassed leisurely down the drive, and out at the gate, and\u2014was never\r\nseen again. From that hour, he vanished completely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPretty\u2014very pretty\u2014altogether a charming little problem,\u201d murmured\r\nPoirot. \u201cProceed, my good friend.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout a quarter of an hour later a tall, dark man with a thick\r\nblack moustache rang the front-door bell, and explained that he\r\nhad an appointment with Mr. Davenheim. He gave the name of Lowen,\r\nand in accordance with the banker\u2019s instructions was shown into\r\nthe study. Nearly an hour passed. Mr. Davenheim did not return.\r\nFinally Mr. Lowen rang the bell, and explained that he was unable\r\nto wait any longer, as he must catch his train back to town. Mrs.\r\nDavenheim apologized for her husband\u2019s absence, which seemed\r\nunaccountable, as she knew him to have been expecting the visitor.\r\nMr. Lowen reiterated his regrets and took his departure.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, as every one knows, Mr. Davenheim did not return. Early on\r\nSunday morning the police were communicated with, but could make\r\nneither head nor tail of the matter. Mr. Davenheim seemed literally\r\nto have vanished into thin air. He had not been to the post office;\r\nnor had he been seen passing through the village. At the station\r\nthey were positive he had not departed by any train. His own motor\r\nhad not left the garage. If he had hired a car to meet him in some\r\nlonely spot, it seems almost certain that by this time, in view of\r\nthe large reward offered for information, the driver of it would\r\nhave come forward to tell what he knew. True, there was a small\r\nrace-meeting at Entfield, five miles away, and if he had walked to\r\nthat station he might have passed unnoticed in the crowd. But since\r\nthen his photograph and a full description of him have been\r\ncirculated in every newspaper, and nobody has been able to give\r\nany news of him. We have, of course, received many letters from\r\nall over England, but each clue, so far, has ended in disappointment.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn Monday morning a further sensational discovery came to light.\r\nBehind a porti\u00e8re in Mr. Davenheim\u2019s study stands a safe, and that\r\nsafe had been broken into and rifled. The windows were fastened\r\nsecurely on the inside, which seems to put an ordinary burglary\r\nout of court, unless, of course, an accomplice within the house\r\nfastened them again afterwards. On the other hand, Sunday having\r\nintervened, and the household being in a state of chaos, it is\r\nlikely that the burglary was committed on the Saturday, and remained\r\nundetected until Monday.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment_,\u201d said Poirot dryly. \u201cWell, is he arrested, _ce\r\npauvre M. Lowen_?\u201d\r\n\r\nJapp grinned. \u201cNot yet. But he\u2019s under pretty close supervision.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded. \u201cWhat was taken from the safe? Have you any idea?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been going into that with the junior partner of the firm\r\nand Mrs. Davenheim. Apparently there was a considerable amount in\r\nbearer bonds, and a very large sum in notes, owing to some large\r\ntransaction having been just carried through. There was also a\r\nsmall fortune in jewellery. All Mrs. Davenheim\u2019s jewels were kept\r\nin the safe. The purchasing of them had become a passion with her\r\nhusband of late years, and hardly a month passed that he did not\r\nmake her a present of some rare and costly gem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAltogether a good haul,\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully. \u201cNow, what\r\nabout Lowen? Is it known what his business was with Davenheim that\r\nevening?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, the two men were apparently not on very good terms. Lowen\r\nis a speculator in quite a small way. Nevertheless, he has been\r\nable once or twice to score a _coup_ off Davenheim in the market,\r\nthough it seems they seldom or never actually met. It was a matter\r\nconcerning some South American shares which led the banker to make\r\nhis appointment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHad Davenheim interests in South America, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe so. Mrs. Davenheim happened to mention that he spent\r\nall last autumn in Buenos Ayres.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAny trouble in his home life? Were the husband and wife on good\r\nterms?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should say his domestic life was quite peaceful and uneventful.\r\nMrs. Davenheim is a pleasant, rather unintelligent woman. Quite a\r\nnonentity, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen we must not look for the solution of the mystery there. Had\r\nhe any enemies?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe had plenty of financial rivals, and no doubt there are many\r\npeople whom he has got the better of who bear him no particular\r\ngood-will. But there was no one likely to make away with him\u2014and,\r\nif they had, where is the body?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly. As Hastings says, bodies have a habit of coming to light\r\nwith fatal persistency.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the way, one of the gardeners says he saw a figure going round\r\nto the side of the house toward the rose-garden. The long French\r\nwindow of the study opens on to the rose-garden, and Mr. Davenheim\r\nfrequently entered and left the house that way. But the man was a\r\ngood way off, at work on some cucumber frames, and cannot even say\r\nwhether it was the figure of his master or not. Also, he cannot\r\nfix the time with any accuracy. It must have been before six, as\r\nthe gardeners cease work at that time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd Mr. Davenheim left the house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout half-past five or thereabouts.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat lies beyond the rose-garden?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA lake.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith a boathouse?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, a couple of punts are kept there. I suppose you\u2019re thinking\r\nof suicide, Monsieur Poirot? Well, I don\u2019t mind telling you that\r\nMiller\u2019s going down to-morrow expressly to see that piece of water\r\ndragged. That\u2019s the kind of man he is!\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled faintly, and turned to me. \u201cHastings, I pray you,\r\nhand me that copy of the _Daily Megaphone_. If I remember rightly,\r\nthere is an unusually clear photograph there of the missing man.\u201d\r\n\r\nI rose, and found the sheet required. Poirot studied the features\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\n\u201cH\u2019m!\u201d he murmured. \u201cWears his hair rather long and wavy, full\r\nmoustache and pointed beard, bushy eyebrows. Eyes dark?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHair and beard turning grey?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe detective nodded. \u201cWell, Monsieur Poirot, what have you got to\r\nsay to it all? Clear as daylight, eh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOn the contrary, most obscure.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Scotland Yard man looked pleased.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhich gives me great hopes of solving it,\u201d finished Poirot\r\nplacidly.\r\n\r\n\u201cEh?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI find it a good sign when a case is obscure. If a thing is clear\r\nas daylight\u2014_eh bien_, mistrust it! Some one has made it so.\u201d\r\n\r\nJapp shook his head almost pityingly. \u201cWell, each to their fancy.\r\nBut it\u2019s not a bad thing to see your way clear ahead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not see,\u201d murmured Poirot. \u201cI shut my eyes\u2014and think.\u201d\r\n\r\nJapp sighed. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve got a clear week to think in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you will bring me any fresh developments that arise\u2014the result\r\nof the labours of the hard-working and lynx-eyed Inspector Miller,\r\nfor instance?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. That\u2019s in the bargain.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSeems a shame, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d said Japp to me as I accompanied him\r\nto the door. \u201cLike robbing a child!\u201d\r\n\r\nI could not help agreeing with a smile. I was still smiling as I\r\nre-entered the room.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien!_\u201d said Poirot immediately. \u201cYou make fun of Papa Poirot,\r\nis it not so?\u201d He shook his finger at me. \u201cYou do not trust his\r\ngrey cells? Ah, do not be confused! Let us discuss this little\r\nproblem\u2014incomplete as yet, I admit, but already showing one or two\r\npoints of interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe lake!\u201d I said significantly.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd even more than the lake, the boathouse!\u201d\r\n\r\nI looked sidewise at Poirot. He was smiling in his most inscrutable\r\nfashion. I felt that, for the moment, it would be quite useless to\r\nquestion him further.\r\n\r\nWe heard nothing of Japp until the following evening, when he\r\nwalked in about nine o\u2019clock. I saw at once by his expression that\r\nhe was bursting with news of some kind.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien_, my friend,\u201d remarked Poirot. \u201cAll goes well? But do\r\nnot tell me that you have discovered the body of Mr. Davenheim in\r\nyour lake, because I shall not believe you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t found the body, but we did find his _clothes_\u2014the\r\nidentical clothes he was wearing that day. What do you say to\r\nthat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAny other clothes missing from the house?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, his valet is quite positive on that point. The rest of his\r\nwardrobe is intact. There\u2019s more. We\u2019ve arrested Lowen. One of the\r\nmaids, whose business it is to fasten the bedroom windows, declares\r\nthat she saw Lowen coming _towards_ the study through the\r\nrose-garden about a quarter past six. That would be about ten\r\nminutes before he left the house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat does he himself say to that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDenied first of all that he had ever left the study. But the maid\r\nwas positive, and he pretended afterwards that he had forgotten\r\njust stepping out of the window to examine an unusual species of\r\nrose. Rather a weak story! And there\u2019s fresh evidence against him\r\ncome to light. Mr. Davenheim always wore a thick gold ring set with\r\na solitaire diamond on the little finger of his right hand. Well,\r\nthat ring was pawned in London on Saturday night by a man called\r\nBilly Kellett! He\u2019s already known to the police\u2014did three months\r\nlast autumn for lifting an old gentleman\u2019s watch. It seems he tried\r\nto pawn the ring at no less than five different places, succeeded\r\nat the last one, got gloriously drunk on the proceeds, assaulted\r\na policeman, and was run in in consequence. I went to Bow Street\r\nwith Miller and saw him. He\u2019s sober enough now, and I don\u2019t mind\r\nadmitting we pretty well frightened the life out of him, hinting\r\nhe might be charged with murder. This is his yarn, and a very queer\r\none it is.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was at Entfield races on Saturday, though I dare say scarfpins\r\nwas his line of business, rather than betting. Anyway, he had a\r\nbad day, and was down on his luck. He was tramping along the road\r\nto Chingside, and sat down in a ditch to rest just before he got\r\ninto the village. A few minutes later he noticed a man coming along\r\nthe road to the village, \u2018dark-complexioned gent, with a big\r\nmoustache, one of them city toffs,\u2019 is his description of the man.\r\n\r\n\u201cKellett was half concealed from the road by a heap of stones. Just\r\nbefore he got abreast of him, the man looked quickly up and down\r\nthe road, and seeing it apparently deserted he took a small object\r\nfrom his pocket and threw it over the hedge. Then he went on\r\ntowards the station. Now, the object he had thrown over the hedge\r\nhad fallen with a slight \u2018chink\u2019 which aroused the curiosity of\r\nthe human derelict in the ditch. He investigated and, after a short\r\nsearch, discovered the ring! That is Kellett\u2019s story. It\u2019s only\r\nfair to say that Lowen denies it utterly, and of course the word\r\nof a man like Kellett can\u2019t be relied upon in the slightest. It\u2019s\r\nwithin the bounds of possibility that he met Davenheim in the lane\r\nand robbed and murdered him.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cVery improbable, _mon ami_. He had no means of disposing of the\r\nbody. It would have been found by now. Secondly, the open way in\r\nwhich he pawned the ring makes it unlikely that he did murder to\r\nget it. Thirdly, your sneak-thief is rarely a murderer. Fourthly,\r\nas he has been in prison since Saturday, it would be too much of\r\na coincidence that he is able to give so accurate a description of\r\nLowen.\u201d\r\n\r\nJapp nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t say you\u2019re not right. But all the same, you\r\nwon\u2019t get a jury to take much note of a jailbird\u2019s evidence. What\r\nseems odd to me is that Lowen couldn\u2019t find a cleverer way of\r\ndisposing of the ring.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders. \u201cWell, after all, if it were found\r\nin the neighbourhood, it might be argued that Davenheim himself\r\nhad dropped it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why remove it from the body at all?\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere might be a reason for that,\u201d said Japp. \u201cDo you know that\r\njust beyond the lake, a little gate leads out on to the hill, and\r\nnot three minutes\u2019 walk brings you to\u2014what do you think?\u2014a _lime\r\nkiln_.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d I cried. \u201cYou mean that the lime which destroyed\r\nthe body would be powerless to affect the metal of the ring?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to me,\u201d I said, \u201cthat that explains everything. What a\r\nhorrible crime!\u201d\r\n\r\nBy common consent we both turned and looked at Poirot. He seemed\r\nlost in reflection, his brow knitted, as though with some supreme\r\nmental effort. I felt that at last his keen intellect was asserting\r\nitself. What would his first words be? We were not long left in\r\ndoubt. With a sigh, the tension of his attitude relaxed, and\r\nturning to Japp, he asked:\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you any idea, my friend, whether Mr. and Mrs. Davenheim\r\noccupied the same bedroom?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe question seemed so ludicrously inappropriate that for a moment\r\nwe both stared in silence. Then Japp burst into a laugh. \u201cGood\r\nLord, Monsieur Poirot, I thought you were coming out with something\r\nstartling. As to your question, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou could find out?\u201d asked Poirot with curious persistence.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, certainly\u2014if you _really_ want to know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Merci, mon ami_. I should be obliged if you would make a point\r\nof it.\u201d\r\n\r\nJapp stared at him a few minutes longer, but Poirot seemed to have\r\nforgotten us both. The detective shook his head sadly at me, and\r\nmurmuring, \u201cPoor old fellow! War\u2019s been too much for him!\u201d gently\r\nwithdrew from the room.\r\n\r\nAs Poirot still seemed sunk in a daydream, I took a sheet of paper,\r\nand amused myself by scribbling notes upon it. My friend\u2019s voice\r\naroused me. He had come out of his reverie, and was looking brisk\r\nand alert.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Que faites-vous l\u00e0, mon ami?_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was jotting down what occurred to me as the main points of\r\ninterest in this affair.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou become methodical\u2014at last!\u201d said Poirot approvingly.\r\n\r\nI concealed my pleasure. \u201cShall I read them to you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy all means.\u201d\r\n\r\nI cleared my throat.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018One: All the evidence points to Lowen having been the man who\r\nforced the safe.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Two: He had a grudge against Davenheim.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Three: He lied in his first statement that he had never left the\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Four: If you accept Billy Kellett\u2019s story as true, Lowen is\r\nunmistakably implicated.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nI paused. \u201cWell?\u201d I asked, for I felt that I had put my finger on\r\nall the vital facts.\r\n\r\nPoirot looked at me pityingly, shaking his head very gently. \u201c_Mon\r\npauvre ami!_ But it is that you have not the gift! The important\r\ndetail, you appreciate him never! Also, your reasoning is false.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me take your four points.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne: Mr. Lowen could not possibly know that he would have the\r\nchance to open the safe. He came for a business interview. He could\r\nnot know beforehand that Mr. Davenheim would be absent posting a\r\nletter, and that he would consequently be alone in the study!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe might have seized his opportunity,\u201d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the tools? City gentlemen do not carry round housebreaker\u2019s\r\ntools on the off chance! And one could not cut into that safe with\r\na penknife, _bien entendu_!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what about Number Two?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou say Lowen had a grudge against Mr. Davenheim. What you mean\r\nis that he had once or twice got the better of him. And presumably\r\nthose transactions were entered into with the view of benefiting\r\nhimself. In any case you do not as a rule bear a grudge against a\r\nman you have got the better of\u2014it is more likely to be the other\r\nway about. Whatever grudge there might have been would have been\r\non Mr. Davenheim\u2019s side.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t deny that he lied about never having left the\r\nstudy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo. But he may have been frightened. Remember, the missing man\u2019s\r\nclothes had just been discovered in the lake. Of course, as usual,\r\nhe would have done better to speak the truth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd the fourth point?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI grant you that. If Kellett\u2019s story is true, Lowen is undeniably\r\nimplicated. That is what makes the affair so very interesting.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I did appreciate _one_ vital fact?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps\u2014but you have entirely overlooked the two most important\r\npoints, the ones which undoubtedly hold the clue to the whole\r\nmatter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd pray, what are they?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne, the passion which has grown upon Mr. Davenheim in the last\r\nfew years for buying jewellery. Two, his trip to Buenos Ayres last\r\nautumn.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoirot, you are joking!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am most serious. Ah, sacred thunder, but I hope Japp will not\r\nforget my little commission.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the detective, entering into the spirit of the joke, had\r\nremembered it so well that a telegram was handed to Poirot about\r\neleven o\u2019clock the next day. At his request I opened it and read\r\nit out:\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Husband and wife have occupied separate rooms since last winter.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d cried Poirot. \u201cAnd now we are in mid June! All is solved!\u201d\r\n\r\nI stared at him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have no moneys in the bank of Davenheim and Salmon, _mon\r\nami_?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, wondering. \u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause I should advise you to withdraw it\u2014before it is too\r\nlate.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, what do you expect?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI expect a big smash in a few days\u2014perhaps sooner. Which reminds\r\nme, we will return the compliment of a _d\u00e9p\u00eache_ to Japp. A pencil,\r\nI pray you, and a form. _Voil\u00e0!_ \u2018Advise you to withdraw any money\r\ndeposited with firm in question.\u2019 That will intrigue him, the good\r\nJapp! His eyes will open wide\u2014wide! He will not comprehend in the\r\nslightest\u2014until to-morrow, or the next day!\u201d\r\n\r\nI remained sceptical, but the morrow forced me to render tribute\r\nto my friend\u2019s remarkable powers. In every paper was a huge headline\r\ntelling of the sensational failure of the Davenheim bank. The\r\ndisappearance of the famous financier took on a totally different\r\naspect in the light of the revelation of the financial affairs of\r\nthe bank.\r\n\r\nBefore we were half-way through breakfast, the door flew open and\r\nJapp rushed in. In his left hand was a paper; in his right was\r\nPoirot\u2019s telegram, which he banged down on the table in front of\r\nmy friend.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you know, Monsieur Poirot? How the blazes could you know?\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot smiled placidly at him. \u201cAh, _mon ami_, after your wire, it\r\nwas a certainty! From the commencement, see you, it struck me that\r\nthe safe burglary was somewhat remarkable. Jewels, ready money,\r\nbearer bonds\u2014all so conveniently arranged for\u2014whom? Well, the good\r\nMonsieur Davenheim was of those who \u2018look after Number One\u2019 as your\r\nsaying goes! It seemed almost certain that it was arranged\r\nfor\u2014himself! Then his passion of late years for buying jewellery!\r\nHow simple! The funds he embezzled, he converted into jewels, very\r\nlikely replacing them in turn with paste duplicates, and so he put\r\naway in a safe place, under another name, a considerable fortune\r\nto be enjoyed all in good time when every one has been thrown off\r\nthe track. His arrangements completed, he makes an appointment with\r\nMr. Lowen (who has been imprudent enough in the past to cross the\r\ngreat man once or twice), drills a hole in the safe, leaves orders\r\nthat the guest is to be shown into the study, and walks out of the\r\nhouse\u2014where?\u201d Poirot stopped, and stretched out his hand for\r\nanother boiled egg. He frowned. \u201cIt is really insupportable,\u201d he\r\nmurmured, \u201cthat every hen lays an egg of a different size! What\r\nsymmetry can there be on the breakfast table? At least they should\r\nsort them in dozens at the shop!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind the eggs,\u201d said Japp impatiently. \u201cLet \u2019em lay \u2019em\r\nsquare if they like. Tell us where our customer went to when he\r\nleft The Cedars\u2014that is, if you know!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien_, he went to his hiding-place. Ah, this Monsieur\r\nDavenheim, there may be some malformation in his grey cells, but\r\nthey are of the first quality!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you know where he is hiding?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly! It is most ingenious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor the Lord\u2019s sake, tell us, then!\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot gently collected every fragment of shell from his plate,\r\nplaced them in the egg-cup, and reversed the empty egg-shell on\r\ntop of them. This little operation concluded, he smiled on the neat\r\neffect, and then beamed affectionately on us both.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, my friends, you are men of intelligence. Ask yourselves the\r\nquestion which I asked myself. \u2018If I were this man, where should\r\n_I_ hide?\u2019 Hastings, what do you say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m rather inclined to think I\u2019d not do a bolt at\r\nall. I\u2019d stay in London\u2014in the heart of things, travel by tubes\r\nand buses; ten to one I\u2019d never be recognized. There\u2019s safety in\r\na crowd.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot turned inquiringly to Japp.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree. Get clear away at once\u2014that\u2019s the only chance. I\r\nwould have had plenty of time to prepare things beforehand. I\u2019d\r\nhave a yacht waiting, with steam up, and I\u2019d be off to one of the\r\nmost out-of-the-way corners of the world before the hue and cry\r\nbegan!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe both looked at Poirot. \u201cWhat do _you_ say, monsieur?\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment he remained silent. Then a very curious smile flitted\r\nacross his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy friends, if _I_ were hiding from the police, do you know\r\n_where_ I should hide? _In a prison!_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_What?_\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are seeking Monsieur Davenheim in order to put him in prison,\r\nso you never dream of looking to see if he may not be already\r\nthere!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou tell me Madame Davenheim is not a very intelligent woman.\r\nNevertheless I think that if you took her to Bow Street and\r\nconfronted her with the man Billy Kellett, she would recognize him!\r\nIn spite of the fact that he has shaved his beard and moustache\r\nand those bushy eyebrows, and has cropped his hair close. A woman\r\nnearly always knows her husband, though the rest of the world may\r\nbe deceived!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBilly Kellett? But he\u2019s known to the police!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid I not tell you Davenheim was a clever man? He prepared his\r\nalibi long beforehand. He was not in Buenos Ayres last autumn\u2014he\r\nwas creating the character of Billy Kellett, \u2018doing three months,\u2019\r\nso that the police should have no suspicions when the time came.\r\nHe was playing, remember, for a large fortune, as well as liberty.\r\nIt was worth while doing the thing thoroughly. Only\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien_, afterwards he had to wear a false beard and wig, had\r\nto _make up as himself_ again, and to sleep with a false beard is\r\nnot easy\u2014it invites detection! He cannot risk continuing to share\r\nthe chamber of madame his wife. You found out for me that for the\r\nlast six months, or ever since his supposed return from Buenos\r\nAyres, he and Mrs. Davenheim occupied separate rooms. Then I was\r\nsure! Everything fitted in. The gardener who fancied he saw his\r\nmaster going round to the side of the house was quite right. He\r\nwent to the boathouse, donned his \u2018tramp\u2019 clothes, which you may\r\nbe sure had been safely hidden from the eyes of his valet, dropped\r\nthe others in the lake, and proceeded to carry out his plan by\r\npawning the ring in an obvious manner, and then assaulting a\r\npoliceman, getting himself safely into the haven of Bow Street,\r\nwhere nobody would ever dream of looking for him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible,\u201d murmured Japp.\r\n\r\n\u201cAsk Madame,\u201d said my friend, smiling.\r\n\r\nThe next day a registered letter lay beside Poirot\u2019s plate. He\r\nopened it, and a five-pound note fluttered out. My friend\u2019s brow\r\npuckered.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Ah, sacr\u00e9!_ But what shall I do with it? I have much remorse!\r\n_Ce pauvre Japp_! Ah, an idea! We will have a little dinner, we\r\nthree! That consoles me. It was really too easy. I am ashamed. I,\r\nwho would not rob a child\u2014_mille tonnerres! Mon ami_, what have\r\nyou, that you laugh so heartily?\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  X\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Adventure of the Italian Nobleman\r\n\r\n\r\nPoirot and I had many friends and acquaintances of an informal\r\nnature. Amongst these was to be numbered Dr. Hawker, a near\r\nneighbour of ours, and a member of the medical profession. It was\r\nthe genial doctor\u2019s habit to drop in sometimes of an evening and\r\nhave a chat with Poirot, of whose genius he was an ardent admirer.\r\nThe doctor himself, frank and unsuspicious to the last degree,\r\nadmired the talents so far removed from his own.\r\n\r\nOn one particular evening in early June, he arrived about half-past\r\neight and settled down to a comfortable discussion on the cheery\r\ntopic of the prevalence of arsenical poisoning in crimes. It must\r\nhave been about a quarter of an hour later when the door of our\r\nsitting-room flew open, and a distracted female precipitated\r\nherself into the room.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, doctor, you\u2019re wanted! Such a terrible voice. It gave me a\r\nturn, it did indeed.\u201d\r\n\r\nI recognized in our new visitor Dr. Hawker\u2019s housekeeper, Miss\r\nRider. The doctor was a bachelor, and lived in a gloomy old house\r\na few streets away. The usually placid Miss Rider was now in a\r\nstate bordering on incoherence.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat terrible voice? Who is it, and what\u2019s the trouble?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was the telephone, doctor. I answered it\u2014and a voice spoke.\r\n\u2018Help,\u2019 it said. \u2018Doctor\u2014help. They\u2019ve killed me!\u2019 Then it sort of\r\ntailed away. \u2018Who\u2019s speaking?\u2019 I said. \u2018Who\u2019s speaking?\u2019 Then I\r\ngot a reply, just a whisper, it seemed, \u2018Foscatine\u2019\u2014something like\r\nthat\u2014\u2018Regent\u2019s Court.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor uttered an exclamation.\r\n\r\n\u201cCount Foscatini. He has a flat in Regent\u2019s Court. I must go at\r\nonce. What can have happened?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA patient of yours?\u201d asked Poirot.\r\n\r\n\u201cI attended him for some slight ailment a few weeks ago. An Italian,\r\nbut he speaks English perfectly. Well, I must wish you good night,\r\nMonsieur Poirot, unless\u2014\u2014\u201d He hesitated.\r\n\r\n\u201cI perceive the thought in your mind,\u201d said Poirot, smiling. \u201cI\r\nshall be delighted to accompany you. Hastings, run down and get\r\nhold of a taxi.\u201d\r\n\r\nTaxis always make themselves sought for when one is particularly\r\npressed for time, but I captured one at last, and we were soon\r\nbowling along in the direction of Regent\u2019s Park. Regent\u2019s Court\r\nwas a new block of flats, situated just off St. John\u2019s Wood Road.\r\nThey had only recently been built, and contained the latest service\r\ndevices.\r\n\r\nThere was no one in the hall. The doctor pressed the lift-bell\r\nimpatiently, and when the lift arrived questioned the uniformed\r\nattendant sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cFlat II. Count Foscatini. There\u2019s been an accident there, I\r\nunderstand.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man stared at him.\r\n\r\n\u201cFirst I\u2019ve heard of it. Mr. Graves\u2014that\u2019s Count Foscatini\u2019s\r\nman\u2014went out about half an hour ago, and he said nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIs the Count alone in the flat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir, he\u2019s got two gentlemen dining with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are they like?\u201d I asked eagerly.\r\n\r\nWe were in the lift now, ascending rapidly to the second floor, on\r\nwhich Flat II was situated.\r\n\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see them myself, sir, but I understand that they were\r\nforeign gentlemen.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe pulled back the iron door, and we stepped out on the landing.\r\nNo. II was opposite to us. The doctor rang the bell. There was no\r\nreply, and we could hear no sound from within. The doctor rang\r\nagain and again; we could hear the bell trilling within, but no\r\nsign of life rewarded us.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is getting serious,\u201d muttered the doctor. He turned to the\r\nlift attendant.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs there any pass-key to this door?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is one in the porter\u2019s office downstairs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGet it, then, and, look here, I think you\u2019d better send for the\r\npolice.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot approved with a nod of the head.\r\n\r\nThe man returned shortly; with him came the manager.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you tell me, gentlemen, what is the meaning of all this?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly. I received a telephone message from Count Foscatini\r\nstating that he had been attacked and was dying. You can understand\r\nthat we must lose no time\u2014if we are not already too late.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe manager produced the key without more ado, and we all entered\r\nthe flat.\r\n\r\nWe passed first into a small square lounge hall. A door on the\r\nright of it was half open. The manager indicated it with a nod.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe dining-room.\u201d\r\n\r\nDr. Hawker led the way. We followed close on his heels. As we\r\nentered the room I gave a gasp. The round table in the centre bore\r\nthe remains of a meal; three chairs were pushed back, as though\r\ntheir occupants had just risen. In the corner, to the right of the\r\nfire-place, was a big writing-table, and sitting at it was a man\u2014or\r\nwhat had been a man. His right hand still grasped the base of the\r\ntelephone, but he had fallen forward, struck down by a terrific\r\nblow on the head from behind. The weapon was not far to seek. A\r\nmarble statuette stood where it had been hurriedly put down, the\r\nbase of it stained with blood.\r\n\r\nThe doctor\u2019s examination did not take a minute. \u201cStone dead. Must\r\nhave been almost instantaneous. I wonder he even managed to\r\ntelephone. It will be better not to move him until the police\r\narrive.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn the manager\u2019s suggestion we searched the flat, but the result\r\nwas a foregone conclusion. It was not likely that the murderers\r\nwould be concealed there when all they had to do was to walk out.\r\n\r\nWe came back to the dining-room. Poirot had not accompanied us in\r\nour tour. I found him studying the centre table with close\r\nattention. I joined him. It was a well-polished round mahogany\r\ntable. A bowl of roses decorated the centre, and white lace mats\r\nreposed on the gleaming surface. There was a dish of fruit, but\r\nthe three dessert plates were untouched. There were three\r\ncoffee-cups with remains of coffee in them\u2014two black, one with\r\nmilk. All three men had taken port, and the decanter, half-full,\r\nstood before the centre plate. One of the men had smoked a cigar,\r\nthe other two cigarettes. A tortoiseshell-and-silver box, holding\r\ncigars and cigarettes, stood open upon the table.\r\n\r\nI enumerated all these facts to myself, but I was forced to admit\r\nthat they did not shed any brilliant light on the situation. I\r\nwondered what Poirot saw in them to make him so intent. I asked\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Mon ami_,\u201d he replied, \u201cyou miss the point. I am looking for\r\nsomething that I do _not_ see.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA mistake\u2014even a little mistake\u2014on the part of the murderer.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stepped swiftly to the small adjoining kitchen, looked in, and\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur,\u201d he said to the manager, \u201cexplain to me, I pray, your\r\nsystem of serving meals here.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe manager stepped to a small hatch in the wall.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the service lift,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt runs to the kitchens\r\nat the top of the building. You order through this telephone, and\r\nthe dishes are sent down in the lift, one course at a time. The\r\ndirty plates and dishes are sent up in the same manner. No domestic\r\nworries, you understand, and at the same time you avoid the wearying\r\npublicity of always dining in a restaurant.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen the plates and dishes that were used to-night are on high in\r\nthe kitchen. You permit that I mount there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, certainly, if you like! Roberts, the lift man, will take you\r\nup and introduce you; but I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t find anything that\u2019s\r\nof any use. They\u2019re handling hundreds of plates and dishes, and\r\nthey\u2019ll be all lumped together.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot remained firm, however, and together we visited the kitchens\r\nand questioned the man who had taken the order from Flat II.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe order was given from the _\u00e0 la carte menu_\u2014for three,\u201d he\r\nexplained. \u201cSoup julienne, filet de sole normande, tournedos of\r\nbeef, and a rice souffl\u00e9. What time? Just about eight o\u2019clock, I\r\nshould say. No, I\u2019m afraid the plates and dishes have been all\r\nwashed up by now. Unfortunate. You were thinking of finger-prints,\r\nI suppose?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot exactly,\u201d said Poirot, with an enigmatical smile. \u201cI am more\r\ninterested in Count Foscatini\u2019s appetite. Did he partake of every\r\ndish?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; but of course I can\u2019t say how much of each he ate. The plates\r\nwere all soiled, and the dishes empty\u2014that is to say, with the\r\nexception of the rice souffl\u00e9. There was a fair amount of that\r\nleft.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Poirot, and seemed satisfied with the fact.\r\n\r\nAs we descended to the flat again he remarked in a low tone:\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have decidedly to do with a man of method.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean the murderer, or Count Foscatini?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe latter was undoubtedly an orderly gentleman. After imploring\r\nhelp and announcing his approaching demise, he carefully hung up\r\nthe telephone receiver.\u201d\r\n\r\nI stared at Poirot. His words now and his recent inquiries gave me\r\nthe glimmering of an idea.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou suspect poison?\u201d I breathed. \u201cThe blow on the head was a\r\nblind.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot merely smiled.\r\n\r\nWe re-entered the flat to find the local inspector of police had\r\narrived with two constables. He was inclined to resent our\r\nappearance, but Poirot calmed him with the mention of our Scotland\r\nYard friend, Inspector Japp, and we were accorded a grudging\r\npermission to remain. It was a lucky thing we were, for we had not\r\nbeen back five minutes before an agitated middle-aged man came\r\nrushing into the room with every appearance of grief and agitation.\r\n\r\nThis was Graves, valet-butler to the late Count Foscatini. The\r\nstory he had to tell was a sensational one.\r\n\r\nOn the previous morning, two gentlemen had called to see his\r\nmaster. They were Italians, and the elder of the two, a man of\r\nabout forty, gave his name as Signor Ascanio. The younger was a\r\nwell-dressed lad of about twenty-four.\r\n\r\nCount Foscatini was evidently prepared for their visit and\r\nimmediately sent Graves out upon some trivial errand. Here the man\r\npaused and hesitated in his story. In the end, however, he admitted\r\nthat, curious as to the purport of the interview, he had not obeyed\r\nimmediately, but had lingered about endeavouring to hear something\r\nof what was going on.\r\n\r\nThe conversation was carried on in so low a tone that he was not\r\nas successful as he had hoped; but he gathered enough to make it\r\nclear that some kind of monetary proposition was being discussed,\r\nand that the basis of it was a threat. The discussion was anything\r\nbut amicable. In the end, Count Foscatini raised his voice slightly,\r\nand the listener heard these words clearly:\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no time to argue further now, gentlemen. If you will dine\r\nwith me to-morrow night at eight o\u2019clock, we will resume the\r\ndiscussion.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfraid of being discovered listening, Graves had then hurried out\r\nto do his master\u2019s errand. This evening the two men had arrived\r\npunctually at eight. During dinner they had talked of indifferent\r\nmatters\u2014politics, the weather, and the theatrical world. When\r\nGraves had placed the port upon the table and brought in the coffee\r\nhis master told him that he might have the evening off.\r\n\r\n\u201cWas that a usual proceeding of his when he had guests?\u201d asked the\r\ninspector.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir; it wasn\u2019t. That\u2019s what made me think it must be some\r\nbusiness of a very unusual kind that he was going to discuss with\r\nthese gentlemen.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat finished Graves\u2019s story. He had gone out about 8.30, and,\r\nmeeting a friend, had accompanied him to the Metropolitan Music\r\nHall in Edgware Road.\r\n\r\nNobody had seen the two men leave, but the time of the murder was\r\nfixed clearly enough at 8.47. A small clock on the writing-table\r\nhad been swept off by Foscatini\u2019s arm, and had stopped at that\r\nhour, which agreed with Miss Rider\u2019s telephone summons.\r\n\r\nThe police surgeon had made his examination of the body, and it\r\nwas now lying on the couch. I saw the face for the first time\u2014the\r\nolive complexion, the long nose, the luxuriant black moustache,\r\nand the full red lips drawn back from the dazzlingly white teeth.\r\nNot altogether a pleasant face.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the inspector, refastening his notebook. \u201cThe case\r\nseems clear enough. The only difficulty will be to lay our hands\r\non this Signor Ascanio. I suppose his address is not in the dead\r\nman\u2019s pocket-book by any chance?\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Poirot had said, the late Foscatini was an orderly man. Neatly\r\nwritten in small, precise handwriting was the inscription, \u201cSignor\r\nPaolo Ascanio, Grosvenor Hotel.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe inspector busied himself with the telephone, then turned to us\r\nwith a grin.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust in time. Our fine gentleman was off to catch the boat train\r\nto the Continong. Well, gentlemen, that\u2019s about all we can do here.\r\nIt\u2019s a bad business, but straightforward enough. One of these\r\nItalian vendetta things, as likely as not.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus airily dismissed, we found our way downstairs. Dr. Hawker was\r\nfull of excitement.\r\n\r\n\u201cLike the beginning of a novel, eh? Real exciting stuff. Wouldn\u2019t\r\nbelieve it if you read about it.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot did not speak. He was very thoughtful. All the evening he\r\nhad hardly opened his lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat says the master detective, eh?\u201d asked Hawker, clapping him\r\non the back. \u201cNothing to work your grey cells over this time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat could there be?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, for example, there is the window.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe window? But it was fastened. Nobody could have got out or in\r\nthat way. I noticed it specially.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why were you able to notice it?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked puzzled. Poirot hastened to explain.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is to the curtains I refer. They were not drawn. A little odd,\r\nthat. And then there was the coffee. It was very black coffee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, what of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery black,\u201d repeated Poirot. \u201cIn conjunction with that let us\r\nremember that very little of the rice souffl\u00e9 was eaten, and we\r\nget\u2014what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMoonshine,\u201d laughed the doctor. \u201cYou\u2019re pulling my leg.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever do I pull the leg. Hastings here knows that I am perfectly\r\nserious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are getting at, all the same,\u201d I confessed.\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t suspect the manservant, do you? He might have been in\r\nwith the gang, and put some dope in the coffee. I suppose they\u2019ll\r\ntest his alibi?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWithout doubt, my friend; but it is the alibi of Signor Ascanio\r\nthat interests me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think he has an alibi?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is just what worries me. I have no doubt that we shall soon\r\nbe enlightened on that point.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe _Daily Newsmonger_ enabled us to become conversant with\r\nsucceeding events.\r\n\r\nSignor Ascanio was arrested and charged with the murder of Count\r\nFoscatini. When arrested, he denied knowing the Count, and declared\r\nhe had never been near Regent\u2019s Court either on the evening of the\r\ncrime or on the previous morning. The younger man had disappeared\r\nentirely. Signor Ascanio had arrived alone at the Grosvenor Hotel\r\nfrom the Continent two days before the murder. All efforts to trace\r\nthe second man failed.\r\n\r\nAscanio, however, was not sent for trial. No less a personage than\r\nthe Italian Ambassador himself came forward and testified at the\r\npolice-court proceedings that Ascanio had been with him at the\r\nEmbassy from eight till nine that evening. The prisoner was\r\ndischarged. Naturally, a lot of people thought that the crime was\r\na political one, and was being deliberately hushed up.\r\n\r\nPoirot had taken a keen interest in all these points. Nevertheless,\r\nI was somewhat surprised when he suddenly informed me one morning\r\nthat he was expecting a visitor at eleven o\u2019clock, and that that\r\nvisitor was none other than Ascanio himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe wishes to consult you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Du tout_, Hastings. I wish to consult him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Regent\u2019s Court murder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are going to prove that he did it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA man cannot be tried twice for murder, Hastings. Endeavour to\r\nhave the common sense. Ah, that is our friend\u2019s ring.\u201d\r\n\r\nA few minutes later Signor Ascanio was ushered in\u2014a small, thin\r\nman with a secretive and furtive glance in his eyes. He remained\r\nstanding, darting suspicious glances from one to the other of us.\r\n\r\n\u201cMonsieur Poirot?\u201d\r\n\r\nMy little friend tapped himself gently on the chest.\r\n\r\n\u201cBe seated, signor. You received my note. I am determined to get\r\nto the bottom of this mystery. In some small measure you can aid\r\nme. Let us commence. You\u2014in company with a friend\u2014visited the late\r\nCount Foscatini on the morning of Tuesday the 9th\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Italian made an angry gesture.\r\n\r\n\u201cI did nothing of the sort. I have sworn in court\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c_Pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment_\u2014and I have a little idea that you have sworn\r\nfalsely.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou threaten me? Bah! I have nothing to fear from you. I have been\r\nacquitted.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly; and as I am not an imbecile, it is not with the gallows\r\nI threaten you\u2014but with publicity. Publicity! I see that you do\r\nnot like the word. I had an idea that you would not. My little\r\nideas, you know, they are very valuable to me. Come, signor, your\r\nonly chance is to be frank with me. I do not ask to know whose\r\nindiscretions brought you to England. I know this much, you came\r\nfor the especial purpose of seeing Count Foscatini.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe was not a count,\u201d growled the Italian.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have already noted the fact that his name does not appear in\r\nthe _Almanach de Gotha_. Never mind, the title of count is often\r\nuseful in the profession of blackmailing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose I might as well be frank. You seem to know a good deal.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have employed my grey cells to some advantage. Come, Signor\r\nAscanio, you visited the dead man on the Tuesday morning\u2014that is\r\nso, is it not?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes; but I never went there on the following evening. There was\r\nno need. I will tell you all. Certain information concerning a man\r\nof great position in Italy had come into this scoundrel\u2019s\r\npossession. He demanded a big sum of money in return for the\r\npapers. I came over to England to arrange the matter. I called upon\r\nhim by appointment that morning. One of the young secretaries of\r\nthe Embassy was with me. The Count was more reasonable than I had\r\nhoped, although even then the sum of money I paid him was a huge\r\none.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPardon, how was it paid?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn Italian notes of comparatively small denomination. I paid over\r\nthe money then and there. He handed me the incriminating papers.\r\nI never saw him again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did you not say all this when you were arrested?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn my delicate position I was forced to deny any association with\r\nthe man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how do you account for the events of the evening, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can only think that some one must have deliberately impersonated\r\nme. I understand that no money was found in the flat.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot looked at him and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cStrange,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWe all have the little grey cells. And so\r\nfew of us know how to use them. Good morning, Signor Ascanio. I\r\nbelieve your story. It is very much as I had imagined. But I had\r\nto make sure.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter bowing his guest out, Poirot returned to his arm-chair and\r\nsmiled at me.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet us hear M. le Capitaine Hastings on the case?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose Ascanio is right\u2014somebody impersonated him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever, never will you use the brains the good God has given you.\r\nRecall to yourself some words I uttered after leaving the flat that\r\nnight. I referred to the window-curtains not being drawn. We are\r\nin the month of June. It is still light at eight o\u2019clock. The light\r\nis failing by half-past. _\u00c7a vous dit quelque chose?_ I perceive\r\na struggling impression that you will arrive some day. Now let us\r\ncontinue. The coffee was, as I said, very black. Count Foscatini\u2019s\r\nteeth were magnificently white. Coffee stains the teeth. We reason\r\nfrom that that Count Foscatini did not drink any coffee. Yet there\r\nwas coffee in all three cups. Why should anyone pretend Count\r\nFoscatini had drunk coffee when he had not done so?\u201d\r\n\r\nI shook my head, utterly bewildered.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome, I will help you. What evidence have we that Ascanio and his\r\nfriend, or two men posing as them, ever came to the flat that\r\nnight? Nobody saw them go in; nobody saw them go out. We have the\r\nevidence of one man and of a host of inanimate objects.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI mean knives and forks and plates and empty dishes. Ah, but it\r\nwas a clever idea! Graves is a thief and a scoundrel, but what a\r\nman of method! He overhears a portion of the conversation in the\r\nmorning, enough to realize that Ascanio will be in awkward position\r\nto defend himself. The following evening, about eight o\u2019clock, he\r\ntells his master he is wanted at the telephone. Foscatini sits\r\ndown, stretches out his hand to the telephone, and from behind\r\nGraves strikes him down with the marble figure. Then quickly to\r\nthe service telephone\u2014dinner for three! It comes, he lays the\r\ntable, dirties the plates, knives, and forks, etc. But he has to\r\nget rid of the food too. Not only is he a man of brain; he has a\r\nresolute and capacious stomach! But after eating three tournedos,\r\nthe rice souffl\u00e9 is too much for him! He even smokes a cigar and\r\ntwo cigarettes to carry out the illusion. Ah, but it was\r\nmagnificently thorough! Then, having moved on the hands of the\r\nclock to 8.47, he smashes it and stops it. The one thing he does\r\nnot do is to draw the curtains. But if there had been a real dinner\r\nparty the curtains would have been drawn as soon as the light began\r\nto fail. Then he hurries out, mentioning the guests to the lift\r\nman in passing. He hurries to a telephone box, and as near as\r\npossible to 8.47 rings up the doctor with his master\u2019s dying cry.\r\nSo successful is his idea that no one ever inquires if a call was\r\nput through from Flat II at that time.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcept Hercule Poirot, I suppose?\u201d I said sarcastically.\r\n\r\n\u201cNot even Hercule Poirot,\u201d said my friend, with a smile. \u201cI am\r\nabout to inquire now. I had to prove my point to you first. But\r\nyou will see, I shall be right; and then Japp, to whom I have\r\nalready given a hint, will be able to arrest the respectable\r\nGraves. I wonder how much of the money he has spent.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot _was_ right. He always is, confound him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  XI\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Case of the Missing Will\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem presented to us by Miss Violet Marsh made rather a\r\npleasant change from our usual routine work. Poirot had received\r\na brisk and business-like note from the lady asking for an\r\nappointment, and he had replied asking her to call upon him at\r\neleven o\u2019clock the following day.\r\n\r\nShe arrived punctually\u2014a tall, handsome young woman, plainly but\r\nneatly dressed, with an assured and business-like manner. Clearly\r\na young woman who meant to get on in the world. I am not a great\r\nadmirer of the so-called New Woman myself, and, in spite of her\r\ngood looks, I was not particularly prepossessed in her favour.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy business is of a somewhat unusual nature, Monsieur Poirot,\u201d\r\nshe began, after she had accepted a chair. \u201cI had better begin at\r\nthe beginning and tell you the whole story.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you please, mademoiselle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am an orphan. My father was one of two brothers, sons of a small\r\nyeoman farmer in Devonshire. The farm was a poor one, and the elder\r\nbrother, Andrew, emigrated to Australia, where he did very well\r\nindeed, and by means of successful speculation in land became a\r\nvery rich man. The younger brother, Roger (my father), had no\r\nleanings towards the agricultural life. He managed to educate\r\nhimself a little, and obtained a post as a clerk with a small firm.\r\nHe married slightly above him; my mother was the daughter of a poor\r\nartist. My father died when I was six years old. When I was\r\nfourteen, my mother followed him to the grave. My only living\r\nrelation then was my Uncle Andrew, who had recently returned from\r\nAustralia and bought a small place, Crabtree Manor, in his native\r\ncounty. He was exceedingly kind to his brother\u2019s orphan child, took\r\nme to live with him, and treated me in every way as though I was\r\nhis own daughter.\r\n\r\n\u201cCrabtree Manor, in spite of its name, is really only an old\r\nfarmhouse. Farming was in my uncle\u2019s blood, and he was intensely\r\ninterested in various modern farming experiments. Although kindness\r\nitself to me, he had certain peculiar and deeply-rooted ideas as\r\nto the up-bringing of women. Himself a man of little or no\r\neducation, though possessing remarkable shrewdness, he placed\r\nlittle value on what he called \u2018book knowledge.\u2019 He was especially\r\nopposed to the education of women. In his opinion, girls should\r\nlearn practical housework and dairy-work, be useful about the home,\r\nand have as little to do with book learning as possible. He proposed\r\nto bring me up on these lines, to my bitter disappointment and\r\nannoyance. I rebelled frankly. I knew that I possessed a good\r\nbrain, and had absolutely no talent for domestic duties. My uncle\r\nand I had many bitter arguments on the subject, for, though much\r\nattached to each other, we were both self-willed. I was lucky\r\nenough to win a scholarship, and up to a certain point was\r\nsuccessful in getting my own way. The crisis arose when I resolved\r\nto go to Girton. I had a little money of my own, left me by my\r\nmother, and I was quite determined to make the best use of the\r\ngifts God had given me. I had one long, final argument with my\r\nuncle. He put the facts plainly before me. He had no other\r\nrelations, and he had intended me to be his sole heiress. As I have\r\ntold you, he was a very rich man. If I persisted in these\r\n\u2018new-fangled notions\u2019 of mine, however, I need look for nothing\r\nfrom him. I remained polite, but firm. I should always be deeply\r\nattached to him, I told him, but I must lead my own life. We parted\r\non that note. \u2018You fancy your brains, my girl,\u2019 were his last\r\nwords. \u2018I\u2019ve no book learning, but, for all that, I\u2019ll pit mine\r\nagainst yours any day. We\u2019ll see what we shall see.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was nine years ago. I have stayed with him for a week-end\r\noccasionally, and our relations were perfectly amicable, though\r\nhis views remained unaltered. He never referred to my having\r\nmatriculated, nor to my B.Sc. For the last three years his health\r\nhad been failing, and a month ago he died.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am now coming to the point of my visit. My uncle left a most\r\nextraordinary will. By its terms, Crabtree Manor and its contents\r\nare to be at my disposal for a year from his death\u2014\u2018during which\r\ntime my clever niece may prove her wits,\u2019 the actual words run. At\r\nthe end of that period, \u2018my wits having proved better than hers,\u2019\r\nthe house and all my uncle\u2019s large fortune pass to various\r\ncharitable institutions.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is a little hard on you, mademoiselle, seeing that you were\r\nMr. Marsh\u2019s only blood relation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not look on it in that way. Uncle Andrew warned me fairly,\r\nand I chose my own path. Since I would not fall in with his wishes,\r\nhe was at perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWas the will drawn up by a lawyer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; it was written on a printed will-form and witnessed by the\r\nman and his wife who live in the house and do for my uncle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere might be a possibility of upsetting such a will?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI would not even attempt to do such a thing.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou regard it, then, as a sporting challenge on the part of your\r\nuncle?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is exactly how I look upon it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt bears that interpretation, certainly,\u201d said Poirot thoughtfully.\r\n\u201cSomewhere in this rambling old manor-house your uncle has concealed\r\neither a sum of money in notes or possibly a second will, and has\r\ngiven you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExactly, Monsieur Poirot; and I am paying you the compliment of\r\nassuming that your ingenuity will be greater than mine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEh, eh! but that is very charming of you. My grey cells are at\r\nyour disposal. You have made no search yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly a cursory one; but I have too much respect for my uncle\u2019s\r\nundoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you the will or a copy of it with you?\u201d\r\n\r\nMiss Marsh handed a document across the table. Poirot ran through\r\nit, nodding to himself.\r\n\r\n\u201cMade three years ago. Dated March 25; and the time is given\r\nalso\u201411 a.m.\u2014that is very suggestive. It narrows the field of\r\nsearch. Assuredly it is another will we have to seek for. A will\r\nmade even half-an-hour later would upset this. _Eh bien_,\r\nmademoiselle, it is a problem charming and ingenious that you have\r\npresented to me here. I shall have all the pleasure in the world\r\nin solving it for you. Granted that your uncle was a man of ability,\r\nhis grey cells cannot have been of the quality of Hercule Poirot\u2019s!\u201d\r\n\r\n(Really, Poirot\u2019s vanity is blatant!)\r\n\r\n\u201cFortunately, I have nothing of moment on hand at the minute.\r\nHastings and I will go down to Crabtree Manor to-night. The man\r\nand wife who attended on your uncle are still there, I presume?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, their name is Baker.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n  \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022   \u2022\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following morning saw us started on the hunt proper. We had\r\narrived late the night before. Mr. and Mrs. Baker, having received\r\na telegram from Miss Marsh, were expecting us. They were a pleasant\r\ncouple, the man gnarled and pink-cheeked, like a shrivelled pippin,\r\nand his wife a woman of vast proportions and true Devonshire calm.\r\n\r\nTired with our journey and the eight-mile drive from the station,\r\nwe had retired at once to bed after a supper of roast chicken,\r\napple pie, and Devonshire cream. We had now disposed of an excellent\r\nbreakfast, and were sitting in a small panelled room which had been\r\nthe late Mr. Marsh\u2019s study and living-room. A roll-top desk stuffed\r\nwith papers, all neatly docketed, stood against the wall, and a\r\nbig leather armchair showed plainly that it had been its owner\u2019s\r\nconstant resting-place. A big chintz-covered settee ran along the\r\nopposite wall, and the deep low window seats were covered with the\r\nsame faded chintz of an old-fashioned pattern.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Eh bien, mon ami_,\u201d said Poirot, lighting one of his tiny\r\ncigarettes, \u201cwe must map out our plan of campaign. Already I have\r\nmade a rough survey of the house, but I am of opinion that any clue\r\nwill be found in this room. We shall have to go through the\r\ndocuments in the desk with meticulous care. Naturally, I do not\r\nexpect to find the will amongst them; but it is likely that some\r\napparently innocent paper may conceal the clue to its hiding-place.\r\nBut first we must have a little information. Ring the bell, I pray\r\nof you.\u201d\r\n\r\nI did so. While we were waiting for it to be answered, Poirot\r\nwalked up and down, looking about him approvingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cA man of method this Mr. Marsh. See how neatly the packets of\r\npapers are docketed; then the key to each drawer has its ivory\r\nlabel\u2014so has the key of the china cabinet on the wall; and see\r\nwith what precision the china within is arranged. It rejoices the\r\nheart. Nothing here offends the eye\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\nHe came to an abrupt pause, as his eye was caught by the key of\r\nthe desk itself, to which a dirty envelope was affixed. Poirot\r\nfrowned at it and withdrew it from the lock. On it were scrawled\r\nthe words: \u201cKey of Roll Top Desk,\u201d in a crabbed handwriting, quite\r\nunlike the neat superscriptions on the other keys.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn alien note,\u201d said Poirot, frowning. \u201cI could swear that here\r\nwe have no longer the personality of Mr. Marsh. But who else has\r\nbeen in the house? Only Miss Marsh, and she, if I mistake not, is\r\nalso a young lady of method and order.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaker came in answer to the bell.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you fetch madame your wife, and answer a few questions?\u201d\r\n\r\nBaker departed, and in a few moments returned with Mrs. Baker,\r\nwiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face.\r\n\r\nIn a few clear words Poirot set forth the object of his mission.\r\nThe Bakers were immediately sympathetic.\r\n\r\n\u201cUs don\u2019t want to see Miss Violet done out of what\u2019s hers,\u201d declared\r\nthe woman. \u201cCruel hard \u2019twould be for hospitals to get it all.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot proceeded with his questions. Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Baker\r\nremembered perfectly witnessing the will. Baker had previously been\r\nsent into the neighbouring town to get two printed will-forms.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwo?\u201d said Poirot sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, for safety like, I suppose, in case he should spoil\r\none\u2014and sure enough, so he did do. Us had signed one\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat time of day was that?\u201d\r\n\r\nBaker scratched his head, but his wife was quicker.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, to be sure, I\u2019d just put the milk on for the cocoa at eleven.\r\nDon\u2019t ee remember? It had all boiled over on the stove when us got\r\nback to kitchen.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd afterwards?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Twould be about an hour later. Us had to go in again. \u2018I\u2019ve made\r\na mistake,\u2019 says old master, \u2018had to tear the whole thing up. I\u2019ll\r\ntrouble you to sign again,\u2019 and us did. And afterwards master give\r\nus a tidy sum of money each. \u2018I\u2019ve left you nothing in my will,\u2019\r\nsays he, \u2018but each year I live you\u2019ll have this to be a nest-egg\r\nwhen I\u2019m gone\u2019; and sure enough, so he did.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoirot reflected.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter you had signed the second time, what did Mr. Marsh do? Do\r\nyou know?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWent out to the village to pay tradesmen\u2019s books.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat did not seem very promising. Poirot tried another tack. He\r\nheld out the key of the desk.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that your master\u2019s writing?\u201d\r\n\r\nI may have imagined it, but I fancied that a moment or two elapsed\r\nbefore Baker replied: \u201cYes, sir, it is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s lying,\u201d I thought. \u201cBut why?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHas your master let the house?\u2014have there been any strangers in\r\nit during the last three years?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo visitors?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly Miss Violet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo strangers of any kind been inside this room?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou forget the workmen, Jim,\u201d his wife reminded him.\r\n\r\n\u201cWorkmen?\u201d Poirot wheeled round on her. \u201cWhat workmen?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe woman explained that about two years and a half ago workmen\r\nhad been in the house to do certain repairs. She was quite vague\r\nas to what the repairs were. Her view seemed to be that the whole\r\nthing was a fad of her master\u2019s and quite unnecessary. Part of the\r\ntime the workmen had been in the study; but what they had done\r\nthere she could not say, as her master had not let either of them\r\ninto the room whilst the work was in progress. Unfortunately, they\r\ncould not remember the name of the firm employed, beyond the fact\r\nthat it was a Plymouth one.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe progress, Hastings,\u201d said Poirot, rubbing his hands as the\r\nBakers left the room. \u201cClearly he made a second will and then had\r\nworkmen from Plymouth in to make a suitable hiding-place. Instead\r\nof wasting time taking up the floor and tapping the walls, we will\r\ngo to Plymouth.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a little trouble, we were able to get the information we\r\nwanted. After one or two essays, we found the firm employed by Mr.\r\nMarsh.\r\n\r\nTheir employees had all been with them many years, and it was easy\r\nto find the two men who had worked under Mr. Marsh\u2019s orders. They\r\nremembered the job perfectly. Amongst various other minor jobs,\r\nthey had taken up one of the bricks of the old-fashioned fireplace,\r\nmade a cavity beneath, and so cut the brick that it was impossible\r\nto see the join. By pressing on the second brick from the end, the\r\nwhole thing was raised. It had been quite a complicated piece of\r\nwork, and the old gentleman had been very fussy about it. Our\r\ninformant was a man called Coghan, a big, gaunt man with a grizzled\r\nmoustache. He seemed an intelligent fellow.\r\n\r\nWe returned to Crabtree Manor in high spirits, and, locking the\r\nstudy door, proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into\r\neffect. It was impossible to see any sign on the bricks, but when\r\nwe pressed in the manner indicated, a deep cavity was at once\r\ndisclosed.\r\n\r\nEagerly Poirot plunged in his hand. Suddenly his face fell from\r\ncomplacent elation to consternation. All he held was a charred\r\nfragment of stiff paper. But for it, the cavity was empty.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Sacr\u00e9!_\u201d cried Poirot angrily. \u201cSome one has been before us.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe examined the scrap of paper anxiously. Clearly it was a fragment\r\nof what we sought. A portion of Baker\u2019s signature remained, but no\r\nindication of what the terms of the will had been.\r\n\r\nPoirot sat back on his heels. His expression would have been\r\ncomical if we had not been so overcome.\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand it not,\u201d he growled. \u201cWho destroyed this? And what\r\nwas their object?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Bakers?\u201d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Pourquoi?_ Neither will makes any provision for them, and they\r\nare more likely to be kept on with Miss Marsh than if the place\r\nbecame the property of a hospital. How could it be to anyone\u2019s\r\nadvantage to destroy the will? The hospitals benefit\u2014yes; but one\r\ncannot suspect institutions.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPerhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself,\u201d\r\nI suggested.\r\n\r\nPoirot rose to his feet, dusting his knees with his usual care.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat may be,\u201d he admitted. \u201cOne of your more sensible observations,\r\nHastings. Well, we can do no more here. We have done all that\r\nmortal man can do. We have successfully pitted our wits against\r\nthe late Andrew Marsh\u2019s; but, unfortunately, his niece is no better\r\noff for our success.\u201d\r\n\r\nBy driving to the station at once, we were just able to catch a\r\ntrain to London, though not the principal express. Poirot was sad\r\nand dissatisfied. For my part, I was tired and dozed in a corner.\r\nSuddenly, as we were just moving out of Taunton, Poirot uttered a\r\npiercing squeal.\r\n\r\n\u201c_Vite_, Hastings! Awake and jump! But jump I say!\u201d\r\n\r\nBefore I knew where I was we were standing on the platform,\r\nbareheaded and minus our valises, whilst the train disappeared into\r\nthe night. I was furious. But Poirot paid no attention.\r\n\r\n\u201cImbecile that I have been!\u201d he cried. \u201cTriple imbecile! Not again\r\nwill I vaunt my little grey cells!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good job at any rate,\u201d I said grumpily. \u201cBut what is this\r\nall about?\u201d\r\n\r\nAs usual, when following out his own ideas, Poirot paid absolutely\r\nno attention to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe tradesmen\u2019s books\u2014I have left them entirely out of account!\r\nYes, but where? Where? Never mind, I cannot be mistaken. We must\r\nreturn at once.\u201d\r\n\r\nEasier said than done. We managed to get a slow train to Exeter,\r\nand there Poirot hired a car. We arrived back at Crabtree Manor in\r\nthe small hours of the morning. I pass over the bewilderment of\r\nthe Bakers when we had at last aroused them. Paying no attention\r\nto anybody, Poirot strode at once to the study.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been, not a triple imbecile, but thirty-six times one, my\r\nfriend,\u201d he deigned to remark. \u201cNow, behold!\u201d\r\n\r\nGoing straight to the desk, he drew out the key, and detached the\r\nenvelope from it. I stared at him stupidly. How could he possibly\r\nhope to find a big will-form in that tiny envelope? With great care\r\nhe cut open the envelope, laying it out flat. Then he lighted the\r\nfire and held the plain inside surface of the envelope to the\r\nflame. In a few minutes faint characters began to appear.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook, _mon ami_!\u201d cried Poirot in triumph.\r\n\r\nI looked. There were just a few lines of faint writing stating\r\nbriefly that he left everything to his niece, Violet Marsh. It was\r\ndated March 25, 12.30 p.m., and witnessed by Albert Pike,\r\nconfectioner, and Jessie Pike, married woman.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut is it legal?\u201d I gasped.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs far as I know, there is no law against writing your will in a\r\nblend of disappearing and sympathetic ink. The intention of the\r\ntestator is clear, and the beneficiary is his only living relation.\r\nBut the cleverness of him! He foresaw every step that a searcher\r\nwould take\u2014that I, miserable imbecile, took. He gets two will-forms,\r\nmakes the servants sign twice, then sallies out with his will\r\nwritten on the inside of a dirty envelope and a fountain-pen\r\ncontaining his little ink mixture. On some excuse he gets the\r\nconfectioner and his wife to sign their names under his own\r\nsignature, then he ties it to the key of his desk and chuckles to\r\nhimself. If his niece sees through his little ruse, she will have\r\njustified her choice of life and elaborate education, and be\r\nthoroughly welcome to his money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t see through it, did she?\u201d I said slowly. \u201cIt seems\r\nrather unfair. The old man really won.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut no, Hastings. It is _your_ wits that go astray. Miss Marsh\r\nproved the astuteness of her wits and the value of the higher\r\neducation for women by at once putting the matter in _my_ hands.\r\nAlways employ the expert. She has amply proved her right to the\r\nmoney.\u201d\r\n\r\nI wonder\u2014I very much wonder\u2014what old Andrew Marsh would have\r\nthought!\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            ","\r\n\r\n\r\nE-text prepared by Brian Foley, Barbara Magni, and the Online Distributed\r\nProofreading Team (http:\/\/www.pgdp.net) from page images generously made\r\navailable by Internet Archive\/American Libraries\r\n(http:\/\/archive.org\/details\/americana)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this\r\n      file which includes the original illustration.\r\n      See 41085-h.htm or 41085-h.zip:\r\n      (https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/cache\/epub\/41085\/pg41085-images.html)\r\n      or\r\n      (https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/41085\/41085-h.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n      Images of the original pages are available through\r\n      Internet Archive\/American Libraries.

Nevertheless--or perhaps indeed it may have been partly on\r\nthat very account--he did not in those opening years read Dante to\r\nany degree worth mentioning: he was well versed in Shakespeare, Walter\r\nScott, Byron, and some other writers, years before he applied himself\r\nto Dante. He may have been fourteen years of age, or even fifteen (May\r\n1843), before he took seriously to the author of the _Divina Commedia_.\r\nHe then read him eagerly, and with the profoundest admiration and\r\ndelight; and from the _Commedia_ he proceeded to the lyrical poems and\r\nthe _Vita Nuova_. I question whether he ever read--unless in the most\r\ncursory way--other and less fascinating writings of Alighieri, such as\r\nthe _Convito_ and the _De Monarchi\u00e2_.\r\n\r\nFrom reading, Rossetti went on to translating. He translated at an\r\nearly age, chiefly between 1845 and 1849, a great number of poems by\r\nthe Italians contemporary with Dante, or preceding him; and, among\r\nother things, he made a version of the whole _Vita Nuova_, prose\r\nand verse. This may possibly have been the first important thing\r\nthat he translated from the Italian: if not the first, still less\r\nwas it the last, and it may well be that his rendering of the book\r\nwas completed within the year 1846, or early in 1847. He did not, of\r\ncourse, leave his version exactly as it had come at first: on the\r\ncontrary, he took counsel with friends (Alfred Tennyson among the\r\nnumber), toned down crudities and juvenilities, and worked to make the\r\nwhole thing impressive and artistic--for in such matters he was much\r\nmore chargeable with over-fastidiousness than with laxity. Still, the\r\nwork, as we now have it, is essentially the work of those adolescent\r\nyears--from time to time reconsidered and improved, but not transmuted.\r\n\r\nSome few years after producing his translation of the _Vita Nuova_,\r\nRossetti was desirous of publishing it, and of illustrating the volume\r\nwith etchings from various designs, which he had meanwhile done, of\r\nincidents in the story. This project, however, had to be laid aside,\r\nowing to want of means, and the etchings were never undertaken. It was\r\nonly in 1861 that the volume named _The Early Italian Poets_, including\r\nthe translated _Vita Nuova_, was brought out: the same volume, with\r\na change in the arrangement of its contents, was reissued in 1874,\r\nentitled _Dante and his Circle_. This book, in its original form, was\r\nreceived with favour, and settled the claim of Rossetti to rank as a\r\npoetic translator, or indeed as a poet in his own right.\r\n\r\nFor _The Early Italian Poets_ he wrote a Preface, from which a passage,\r\nimmediately relating to the _Vita Nuova_, is extracted in the present\r\nedition. There are some other passages, affecting the whole of the\r\ntranslations in that volume, which deserve to be borne in mind, as\r\nshowing the spirit in which he undertook the translating work, and I\r\ngive them here:--\r\n\r\n\"The life-blood of rhythmical translation is this commandment--that a\r\ngood poem shall not be turned into a bad one. The only true motive for\r\nputting poetry into a fresh language must be to endow a fresh nation,\r\nas far as possible, with one more possession of beauty. Poetry not\r\nbeing an exact science, literality of rendering is altogether secondary\r\nto this chief law. I say _literality_,--not fidelity, which is by no\r\nmeans the same thing. When literality can be combined with what is thus\r\nthe primary condition of success, the translator is fortunate, and must\r\nstrive his utmost to unite them; when such object can only be obtained\r\nby paraphrase, that is his only path. Any merit possessed by these\r\ntranslations is derived from an effort to follow this principle.... The\r\ntask of the translator (and with all humility be it spoken) is one of\r\nsome self-denial. Often would he avail himself of any special grace of\r\nhis own idiom and epoch, if only his will belonged to him: often would\r\nsome cadence serve him but for his author's structure--some structure\r\nbut for his author's cadence: often the beautiful turn of a stanza must\r\nbe weakened to adopt some rhyme which will tally, and he sees the poet\r\nrevelling in abundance of language where himself is scantily supplied.\r\nNow he would slight the matter for the music, and now the music for the\r\nmatter; but no, he must deal to each alike. Sometimes too a flaw in the\r\nwork galls him, and he would fain remove it, doing for the poet that\r\nwhich his age denied him; but no, it is not in the bond.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to explain here a very small share which I myself\r\ntook in the _Vita Nuova_ translation. When the volume _The Early\r\nItalian Poets_ was in preparation, my brother asked me (January\r\n1861) to aid by \"collating my _Vita Nuova_ with the original, and\r\namending inaccuracies.\" He defined the work further as follows: \"What\r\nI want is that you should correct my translation throughout, removing\r\ninaccuracies and mannerisms. And, if you have time, it would be a great\r\nservice to translate the analyses of the poems (which I omitted).\r\nThis, however, if you think it desirable to include them. I did not\r\nat the time (on ground of readableness), but since think they may be\r\ndesirable: only have become so unfamiliar with the book that I have\r\nno distinct opinion.\" On January 25th he wrote: \"Many and many thanks\r\nfor a most essential service most thoroughly performed. I have not yet\r\nverified the whole of the notes, but I see they are just what I needed,\r\nand will save me a vast amount of trouble. I should very much wish that\r\nthe translation were more literal, but cannot do it all again. _My_\r\nnotes, which you have taken the trouble of revising, are, of course,\r\nquite paltry and useless.\"\r\n\r\nIn order that the reader may judge as to this question of literality, I\r\nwill give here the literal Englishing of the Sonnet at p. 38, and the\r\nparagraph which precedes it (I take the passage quite at random), and\r\nthe reader can, if he likes, compare this rendering with that which\r\nappears in Dante Rossetti's text:--\r\n\r\n\"After the departure of this gentlewoman it was the pleasure of the\r\nLord of the Angels to call to His glory a lady young and much of\r\nnoble[1] aspect, who was very graceful in this aforesaid city: whose\r\nbody I saw lying without the soul amid many ladies, who were weeping\r\nvery piteously. Then, remembering that erewhile I had seen her keeping\r\ncompany with that most noble one, I could not withhold some tears.\r\nIndeed, weeping, I purposed to speak certain words about her death,\r\nin guerdon of my having at some whiles seen her with my lady. And\r\nsomewhat of this I referred to in the last part of the words which I\r\nspoke of her, as manifestly appears to him who understands them: and\r\nthen I composed these two Sonnets--of which the first begins, 'Weep,\r\nlovers'--the second, 'Villain Death.'\r\n\r\n  [1] _Gentile._ The word means \"noble\" rather than (in its modern\r\n       shade of meaning) \"gentle.\" \"Genteel\" would sometimes apply,\r\n       but has ceased to be admissible in serious writing.\r\n\r\n\"Weep, lovers, since Love weeps,--hearkening what cause makes him\r\nwail: Love hears ladies invoking pity, showing bitter grief outwardly\r\nby the eyes; because villain Death has set his cruel working upon a\r\nnoble heart, ruining that which in a noble lady is to be praised in the\r\nworld, apart from honour. Hear how much Love did her honouring; for I\r\nsaw him lamenting in very person over the dead seemly image: and often\r\nhe gazed towards heaven, wherein was already settled the noble soul who\r\nhad been a lady of such gladsome semblance.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be out of place to enter here into any detailed observations\r\nupon the _Vita Nuova_, its meaning, and the literature which has grown\r\nout of it. I will merely name, as obvious things for the English reader\r\nto consult, the translation which was made by Sir Theodore Martin; the\r\nessay by Professor C. Eliot Norton; the translations published by Dr.\r\nGarnett in his book entitled _Dante, Petrarch, Camoens, 124 Sonnets_,\r\nalong with the remarks in his valuable _History of Italian Literature_;\r\nScartazzini's _Companion to Dante_; and the publications of the Rev.\r\nDr. Moore, the foremost of our living Dante scholars.\r\n\r\n                                                     W. M. ROSSETTI.\r\n\r\n    _August 1899._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_INTRODUCTION._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Vita Nuova_ (the Autobiography or Autopsychology of Dante's youth\r\ntill about his twenty-seventh year) is already well known to many in\r\nthe original, or by means of essays and of English versions partial or\r\nentire. It is therefore, and on all accounts, unnecessary to say much\r\nmore of the work here than it says for itself. Wedded to its exquisite\r\nand intimate beauties are personal peculiarities which excite wonder\r\nand conjecture, best replied to in the words which Beatrice herself\r\nis made to utter in the _Commedia_: \"Questi _f\u00f9 tal_ nella sua vita\r\nnuova.\"[2] Thus then young Dante _was_. All that seemed possible to be\r\ndone here for the work was to translate it in as free and clear a form\r\nas was consistent with fidelity to its meaning; and to ease it, as far\r\nas possible, from notes and encumbrances.\r\n\r\n  [2] \"Purgatorio,\" C. xxx.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted here how necessary a knowledge of the _Vita Nuova_\r\nis to the full comprehension of the part borne by Beatrice in the\r\n_Commedia_. Moreover, it is only from the perusal of its earliest and\r\nthen undivulged self-communings that we can divine the whole bitterness\r\nof wrong to such a soul as Dante's, its poignant sense of abandonment,\r\nor its deep and jealous refuge in memory. Above all, it is here that we\r\nfind the first manifestations of that wisdom of obedience, that natural\r\nbreath of duty, which afterwards, in the _Commedia_, lifted up a mighty\r\nvoice for warning and testimony. Throughout the _Vita Nuova_ there is\r\na strain like the first falling murmur which reaches the ear in some\r\nremote meadow, and prepares us to look upon the sea.\r\n\r\nBoccaccio, in his Life of Dante, tells us that the great poet, in later\r\nlife, was ashamed of this work of his youth. Such a statement hardly\r\nseems reconcilable with the allusions to it made or implied in the\r\n_Commedia_; but it is true that the _Vita Nuova_ is a book which only\r\nyouth could have produced, and which must chiefly remain sacred to\r\nthe young; to each of whom the figure of Beatrice, less lifelike than\r\nlovelike, will seem the friend of his own heart. Nor is this, perhaps,\r\nits least praise. To tax its author with effeminacy on account of the\r\nextreme sensitiveness evinced by this narrative of his love, would be\r\nmanifestly unjust, when we find that, though love alone is the theme of\r\nthe _Vita Nuova_, war already ranked among its author's experiences at\r\nthe period to which it relates. In the year 1289, the one preceding the\r\ndeath of Beatrice, Dante served with the foremost cavalry in the great\r\nbattle of Campaldino, on the eleventh of June, when the Florentines\r\ndefeated the people of Arezzo. In the autumn of the next year, 1290,\r\nwhen for him, by the death of Beatrice, the city as he says \"sat\r\nsolitary,\" such refuge as he might find from his grief was sought in\r\naction and danger: for we learn from the _Commedia_ (Hell, C. xxi.)\r\nthat he served in the war then waged by Florence upon Pisa, and was\r\npresent at the surrender of Caprona. He says, using the reminiscence to\r\ngive life to a description, in his great way:--\r\n\r\n    \"I've seen the troops out of Caprona go\r\n      On terms, affrighted thus, when on the spot\r\n    They found themselves with foemen compass'd so.\"\r\n\r\n                                         (CAYLEY'S _Translation_.)\r\n\r\nA word should be said here of the title of Dante's autobiography.\r\nThe adjective _Nuovo_, _nuova_, or _Novello_, _novella_, literally\r\n_New_, is often used by Dante and other early writers in the sense of\r\n_young_. This has induced some editors of the _Vita Nuova_ to explain\r\nthe title as meaning _Early Life_. I should be glad on some accounts\r\nto adopt this supposition, as everything is a gain which increases\r\nclearness to the modern reader; but on consideration I think the more\r\nmystical interpretation of the words, as _New Life_ (in reference to\r\nthat revulsion of his being which Dante so minutely describes as having\r\noccurred simultaneously with his first sight of Beatrice), appears\r\nthe primary one, and therefore the most necessary to be given in a\r\ntranslation. The probability may be that both were meant, but this I\r\ncannot convey.[3]\r\n\r\n  [3] I must hazard here (to relieve the first page of my translation\r\n       from a long note) a suggestion as to the meaning of the most\r\n       puzzling passage in the whole _Vita Nuova_,--that sentence\r\n       just at the outset which says, \"La gloriosa donna della mia\r\n       mente, la quale f\u00f9 chiamata da molti Beatrice, i quali non\r\n       sapeano che si chiamare.\" On this passage all the commentators\r\n       seem helpless, turning it about and sometimes adopting\r\n       alterations not to be found in any ancient manuscript of the\r\n       work. The words mean literally, \"The glorious lady of my\r\n       mind who was called Beatrice by many who knew not how she\r\n       was called.\" This presents the obvious difficulty that the\r\n       lady's name really _was_ Beatrice, and that Dante throughout\r\n       uses that name himself. In the text of my version I have\r\n       adopted, as a rendering, the one of the various compromises\r\n       which seemed to give the most beauty to the meaning. But\r\n       it occurs to me that a less irrational escape out of the\r\n       difficulty than any I have seen suggested may possibly be\r\n       found by linking this passage with the close of the sonnet\r\n       at page 104 of the _Vita Nuova_, beginning, \"I felt a spirit\r\n       of love begin to stir,\" in the last line of which sonnet\r\n       Love is made to assert that the name of Beatrice is _Love_.\r\n       Dante appears to have dwelt on this fancy with some pleasure,\r\n       from what is said in an earlier sonnet (page 39) about \"Love\r\n       in his proper form\" (by which Beatrice seems to be meant)\r\n       bending over a dead lady. And it is in connection with the\r\n       sonnet where the name of Beatrice is said to be Love, that\r\n       Dante, as if to show us that the Love he speaks of is only\r\n       his own emotion, enters into an argument as to Love being\r\n       merely an accident in substance,--in other words, \"Amore e il\r\n       cor gentil son una cosa.\" This conjecture may be pronounced\r\n       extravagant; but the _Vita Nuova_, when examined, proves so\r\n       full of intricate and fantastic analogies, even in the mere\r\n       arrangement of its parts, (much more than appears on any but\r\n       the closest scrutiny,) that it seems admissible to suggest\r\n       even a whimsical solution of a difficulty which remains\r\n       unconquered. Or to have recourse to the much more welcome\r\n       means of solution afforded by simple inherent beauty: may not\r\n       the meaning be merely that any person looking on so noble\r\n       and lovely a creation, without knowledge of her name, must\r\n       have spontaneously called her Beatrice,--_i.e._, the giver\r\n       of blessing? This would be analogous by antithesis to the\r\n       translation I have adopted in my text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDANTE ALIGHIERI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW LIFE.\r\n\r\n(LA VITA NUOVA.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that part of the book of my memory before the which is little that\r\ncan be read, there is a rubric, saying, _Incipit Vita Nova_.[4] Under\r\nsuch rubric I find written many things; and among them the words which\r\nI purpose to copy into this little book; if not all of them, at the\r\nleast their substance.\r\n\r\n  [4] \"Here beginneth the new life.\"\r\n\r\nNine times already since my birth had the heaven of light returned to\r\nthe selfsame point almost, as concerns its own revolution, when first\r\nthe glorious Lady of my mind was made manifest to mine eyes; even she\r\nwho was called Beatrice by many who knew not wherefore.[5] She had\r\nalready been in this life for so long as that, within her time, the\r\nstarry heaven had moved towards the Eastern quarter one of the twelve\r\nparts of a degree; so that she appeared to me at the beginning of her\r\nninth year almost, and I saw her almost at the end of my ninth year.\r\nHer dress, on that day, was of a most noble colour, a subdued and\r\ngoodly crimson, girdled and adorned in such sort as best suited with\r\nher very tender age. At that moment, I say most truly that the spirit\r\nof life, which hath its dwelling in the secretest chamber of the heart,\r\nbegan to tremble so violently that the least pulses of my body shook\r\ntherewith; and in trembling it said these words: _Ecce deus fortior\r\nme, qui veniens dominabitur mihi._[6] At that moment the animate\r\nspirit, which dwelleth in the lofty chamber whither all the senses\r\ncarry their perceptions, was filled with wonder, and speaking more\r\nespecially unto the spirits of the eyes, said these words: _Apparuit\r\njam beatitudo vestra._[7] At that moment the natural spirit, which\r\ndwelleth there where our nourishment is administered, began to weep,\r\nand in weeping said these words: _Heu miser! quia frequenter impeditus\r\nero deinceps._[8]\r\n\r\n  [5] In reference to the meaning of the name, \"She who confers\r\n       blessing.\" We learn from Boccaccio that this first meeting\r\n       took place at a May Feast, given in the year 1274 by Folco\r\n       Portinari, father of Beatrice, who ranked among the principal\r\n       citizens of Florence: to which feast Dante accompanied his\r\n       father, Alighiero Alighieri.\r\n\r\n  [6] \"Here is a deity stronger than I; who, coming, shall rule over\r\n       me.\"\r\n\r\n  [7] \"Your beatitude hath now been made manifest unto you.\"\r\n\r\n  [8] \"Woe is me! for that often I shall be disturbed from this time\r\n       forth!\"\r\n\r\nI say that, from that time forward, Love quite governed my soul; which\r\nwas immediately espoused to him, and with so safe and undisputed a\r\nlordship (by virtue of strong imagination) that I had nothing left\r\nfor it but to do all his bidding continually. He oftentimes commanded\r\nme to seek if I might see this youngest of the Angels: wherefore I in\r\nmy boyhood often went in search of her, and found her so noble and\r\npraiseworthy that certainly of her might have been said those words\r\nof the poet Homer, \"She seemed not to be the daughter of a mortal man,\r\nbut of God.\"[9] And albeit her image, that was with me always, was an\r\nexultation of Love to subdue me, it was yet of so perfect a quality\r\nthat it never allowed me to be overruled by Love without the faithful\r\ncounsel of reason, whensoever such counsel was useful to be heard.\r\nBut seeing that were I to dwell overmuch on the passions and doings of\r\nsuch early youth, my words might be counted something fabulous, I will\r\ntherefore put them aside; and passing many things that may be conceived\r\nby the pattern of these, I will come to such as are writ in my memory\r\nwith a better distinctness.\r\n\r\n  [9]\r\n\r\n                               Oude e\u00f4kei\r\n      Andros ge thn\u00eatou pais emmenai alla theoio.\r\n\r\n                                           (_Iliad_, xxiv. 258.)\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of so many days that nine years exactly were completed\r\nsince the above-written appearance of this most gracious being, on the\r\nlast of those days it happened that the same wonderful lady appeared\r\nto me dressed all in pure white, between two gentle ladies elder\r\nthan she. And passing through a street, she turned her eyes thither\r\nwhere I stood sorely abashed: and by her unspeakable courtesy, which\r\nis now guerdoned in the Great Cycle, she saluted me with so virtuous\r\na bearing that I seemed then and there to behold the very limits of\r\nblessedness. The hour of her most sweet salutation was exactly the\r\nninth of that day; and because it was the first time that any words\r\nfrom her reached mine ears, I came into such sweetness that I parted\r\nthence as one intoxicated. And betaking me to the loneliness of mine\r\nown room, I fell to thinking of this most courteous lady, thinking\r\nof whom I was overtaken by a pleasant slumber, wherein a marvellous\r\nvision was presented to me: for there appeared to be in my room a mist\r\nof the colour of fire, within the which I discerned the figure of a\r\nlord of terrible aspect to such as should gaze upon him, but who seemed\r\ntherewithal to rejoice inwardly that it was a marvel to see. Speaking\r\nhe said many things, among the which I could understand but few; and\r\nof these, this: _Ego dominus tuus._[10] In his arms it seemed to me\r\nthat a person was sleeping, covered only with a blood-coloured cloth;\r\nupon whom looking very attentively, I knew that it was the lady of the\r\nsalutation who had deigned the day before to salute me. And he who held\r\nher held also in his hand a thing that was burning in flames; and he\r\nsaid to me, _Vide cor tuum_.[11] But when he had remained with me a\r\nlittle while, I thought that he set himself to awaken her that slept;\r\nafter the which he made her to eat that thing which flamed in his hand;\r\nand she ate as one fearing. Then, having waited again a space, all his\r\njoy was turned into most bitter weeping; and as he wept he gathered\r\nthe lady into his arms, and it seemed to me that he went with her\r\nup towards heaven: whereby such a great anguish came upon me that my\r\nlight slumber could not endure through it, but was suddenly broken. And\r\nimmediately having considered, I knew that the hour wherein this vision\r\nhad been made manifest to me was the fourth hour (which is to say, the\r\nfirst of the nine last hours) of the night.\r\n\r\n  [10] \"I am thy master.\"\r\n\r\n  [11] \"Behold thy heart.\"\r\n\r\nThen, musing on what I had seen, I proposed to relate the same to many\r\npoets who were famous in that day: and for that I had myself in some\r\nsort the art of discoursing with rhyme, I resolved on making a sonnet,\r\nin the which, having saluted all such as are subject unto Love, and\r\nentreated them to expound my vision, I should write unto them those\r\nthings which I had seen in my sleep. And the sonnet I made was this:--\r\n\r\n    To every heart which the sweet pain doth move,\r\n      And unto which these words may now be brought\r\n      For true interpretation and kind thought,\r\n    Be greeting in our Lord's name, which is Love.\r\n    Of those long hours wherein the stars, above,\r\n      Wake and keep watch, the third was almost nought,\r\n      When Love was shown me with such terrors fraught\r\n    As may not carelessly be spoken of.\r\n    He seemed like one who is full of joy, and had\r\n      My heart within his hand, and on his arm\r\n        My lady, with a mantle round her, slept;\r\n    Whom (having wakened her) anon he made\r\n      To eat that heart; she ate, as fearing harm.\r\n        Then he went out; and as he went, he wept.\r\n\r\n_This sonnet is divided into two parts. In the first part I give\r\ngreeting, and ask an answer; in the second, I signify what thing has to\r\nbe answered to. The second part commences here: \"Of those long hours.\"_\r\n\r\nTo this sonnet I received many answers, conveying many different\r\nopinions; of the which one was sent by him whom I now call the first\r\namong my friends, and it began thus, \"Unto my thinking thou beheld'st\r\nall worth.\"[12] And indeed, it was when he learned that I was he who\r\nhad sent those rhymes to him, that our friendship commenced. But the\r\ntrue meaning of that vision was not then perceived by any one, though\r\nit be now evident to the least skilful.\r\n\r\n  [12] The friend of whom Dante here speaks was Guido Cavalcanti.\r\n\r\nFrom that night forth, the natural functions of my body began to be\r\nvexed and impeded, for I was given up wholly to thinking of this most\r\ngracious creature: whereby in short space I became so weak and so\r\nreduced that it was irksome to many of my friends to look upon me;\r\nwhile others, being moved by spite, went about to discover what it\r\nwas my wish should be concealed. Wherefore I (perceiving the drift of\r\ntheir unkindly questions), by Love's will, who directed me according\r\nto the counsels of reason, told them how it was Love himself who had\r\nthus dealt with me: and I said so, because the thing was so plainly to\r\nbe discerned in my countenance that there was no longer any means of\r\nconcealing it. But when they went on to ask, \"And by whose help hath\r\nLove done this?\" I looked in their faces smiling, and spake no word in\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nNow it fell on a day, that this most gracious creature was sitting\r\nwhere words were to be heard of the Queen of Glory;[13] and I was in\r\na place whence mine eyes could behold their beatitude: and betwixt\r\nher and me, in a direct line, there sat another lady of a pleasant\r\nfavour; who looked round at me many times, marvelling at my continued\r\ngaze which seemed to have _her_ for its object. And many perceived\r\nthat she thus looked; so that departing thence, I heard it whispered\r\nafter me, \"Look you to what a pass _such a lady_ hath brought him;\"\r\nand in saying this they named her who had been midway between the most\r\ngentle Beatrice and mine eyes. Therefore I was reassured, and knew\r\nthat for that day my secret had not become manifest. Then immediately\r\nit came into my mind that I might make use of this lady as a screen to\r\nthe truth: and so well did I play my part that the most of those who\r\nhad hitherto watched and wondered at me, now imagined they had found\r\nme out. By her means I kept my secret concealed till some years were\r\ngone over; and for my better security, I even made divers rhymes in\r\nher honour; whereof I shall here write only as much as concerneth the\r\nmost gentle Beatrice, which is but a very little. Moreover, about the\r\nsame time while this lady was a screen for so much love on my part, I\r\ntook the resolution to set down the name of this most gracious creature\r\naccompanied with many other women's names, and especially with hers\r\nwhom I spake of. And to this end I put together the names of sixty\r\nof the most beautiful ladies in that city where God had placed mine\r\nown lady; and these names I introduced in an epistle in the form of a\r\n_sirvent_, which it is not my intention to transcribe here. Neither\r\nshould I have said anything of this matter, did I not wish to take\r\nnote of a certain strange thing, to wit: that having written the list,\r\nI found my lady's name would not stand otherwise than ninth in order\r\namong the names of these ladies.\r\n\r\n  [13] _i.e._, in a church.\r\n\r\nNow it so chanced with her by whose means I had thus long time\r\nconcealed my desire, that it behoved her to leave the city I speak of,\r\nand to journey afar: wherefore I, being sorely perplexed at the loss\r\nof so excellent a defence, had more trouble than even I could before\r\nhave supposed. And thinking that if I spoke not somewhat mournfully\r\nof her departure, my former counterfeiting would be the more quickly\r\nperceived, I determined that I would make a grievous sonnet[14]\r\nthereof; the which I will write here, because it hath certain words\r\nin it whereof my lady was the immediate cause, as will be plain to him\r\nthat understands.\r\n\r\n  [14] It will be observed that this poem is not what we now call a\r\n       sonnet. Its structure, however, is analogous to that of the\r\n       sonnet, being two sextetts followed by two quatrains, instead\r\n       of two quatrains followed by two triplets. Dante applies the\r\n       term sonnet to both these forms of composition, and to no\r\n       other.\r\n\r\nAnd the sonnet was this:--\r\n\r\n    All ye that pass along Love's trodden way,\r\n    Pause ye awhile and say\r\n      If there be any grief like unto mine:\r\n    I pray you that you hearken a short space\r\n    Patiently, if my case\r\n      Be not a piteous marvel and a sign.\r\n\r\n    Love (never, certes, for my worthless part,\r\n    But of his own great heart,)\r\n      Vouchsafed to me a life so calm and sweet\r\n    That oft I heard folk question as I went\r\n    What such great gladness meant:--\r\n      They spoke of it behind me in the street.\r\n\r\n    But now that fearless bearing is all gone\r\n      Which with Love's hoarded wealth was given me;\r\n      Till I am grown to be\r\n    So poor that I have dread to think thereon.\r\n    And thus it is that I, being like as one\r\n      Who is ashamed and hides his poverty,\r\n      Without seem full of glee,\r\n    And let my heart within travail and moan.\r\n\r\n_This poem has two principal parts; for, in the first, I mean to call\r\nthe Faithful of Love in those words of Jeremias the Prophet_, \"O vos\r\nomnes qui transitis per viam, attendite et videte si est dolor sicut\r\ndolor meus,\" _and to pray them to stay and hear me. In the second I\r\ntell where Love had placed me, with a meaning other than that which\r\nthe last part of the poem shows, and I say what I have lost. The second\r\npart begins here, \"Love, (never, certes).\"_\r\n\r\nA certain while after the departure of that lady, it pleased the Master\r\nof the Angels to call into His glory a damsel, young and of a gentle\r\npresence, who had been very lovely in the city I speak of: and I saw\r\nher body lying without its soul among many ladies, who held a pitiful\r\nweeping. Whereupon, remembering that I had seen her in the company of\r\nexcellent Beatrice, I could not hinder myself from a few tears; and\r\nweeping, I conceived to say somewhat of her death, in guerdon of having\r\nseen her somewhile with my lady; which thing I spake of in the latter\r\nend of the verses that I writ in this matter, as he will discern who\r\nunderstands. And I wrote two sonnets, which are these:--\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n    Weep, Lovers, sith Love's very self doth weep,\r\n      And sith the cause for weeping is so great;\r\n      When now so many dames, of such estate\r\n    In worth, show with their eyes a grief so deep:\r\n    For Death the churl has laid his leaden sleep\r\n      Upon a damsel who was fair of late,\r\n      Defacing all our earth should celebrate,--\r\n    Yea all save virtue, which the soul doth keep.\r\n    Now hearken how much Love did honour her.\r\n      I myself saw him in his proper form\r\n        Bending above the motionless sweet dead,\r\n    And often gazing into Heaven; for there\r\n      The soul now sits which when her life was warm\r\n        Dwelt with the joyful beauty that is fled.\r\n\r\n_This first sonnet is divided into three parts. In the first, I call\r\nand beseech the Faithful of Love to weep; and I say that their Lord\r\nweeps, and that they, hearing the reason why he weeps, shall be more\r\nminded to listen to me. In the second, I relate this reason. In the\r\nthird, I speak of honour done by Love to this Lady. The second part\r\nbegins here, \"When now so many dames;\" the third here, \"Now hearken.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n    Death, alway cruel, Pity's foe in chief,\r\n    Mother who brought forth grief,\r\n      Merciless judgment and without appeal!\r\n      Since thou alone hast made my heart to feel\r\n      This sadness and unweal,\r\n    My tongue upbraideth thee without relief.\r\n\r\n    And now (for I must rid thy name of ruth)\r\n    Behoves me speak the truth\r\n      Touching thy cruelty and wickedness:\r\n      Not that they be not known; but ne'ertheless\r\n      I would give hate more stress\r\n    With them that feed on love in very sooth.\r\n\r\n    Out of this world thou hast driven courtesy,\r\n      And virtue, dearly prized in womanhood;\r\n      And out of youth's gay mood\r\n    The lovely lightness is quite gone through thee.\r\n\r\n    Whom now I mourn, no man shall learn from me\r\n      Save by the measure of these praises given.\r\n      Whoso deserves not Heaven\r\n    May never hope to have her company.[15]\r\n\r\n  [15] The commentators assert that the last two lines here do not\r\n       allude to the dead lady, but to Beatrice. This would make\r\n       the poem very clumsy in construction; yet there must be some\r\n       covert allusion to Beatrice, as Dante himself intimates. The\r\n       only form in which I can trace it consists in the implied\r\n       assertion that such person as _had_ enjoyed the dead lady's\r\n       society was worthy of heaven, and that person was Beatrice.\r\n       Or indeed the allusion to Beatrice might be in the first poem,\r\n       where he says that Love \"_in forma vera_\" (that is, Beatrice),\r\n       mourned over the corpse: as he afterwards says of Beatrice,\r\n       \"_Quella ha nome Amor_.\" Most probably _both_ allusions are\r\n       intended.\r\n\r\n_This poem is divided into four parts. In the first I address Death by\r\ncertain proper names of hers. In the second, speaking to her, I tell\r\nthe reason why I am moved to denounce her. In the third, I rail against\r\nher. In the fourth, I turn to speak to a person undefined, although\r\ndefined in my own conception. The second part commences here, \"Since\r\nthou alone;\" the third here, \"And now (for I must);\" the fourth here,\r\n\"Whoso deserves not.\"_\r\n\r\nSome days after the death of this lady, I had occasion to leave\r\nthe city I speak of, and to go thitherwards where she abode who had\r\nformerly been my protection; albeit the end of my journey reached\r\nnot altogether so far. And notwithstanding that I was visibly in the\r\ncompany of many, the journey was so irksome that I had scarcely sighing\r\nenough to ease my heart's heaviness; seeing that as I went, I left\r\nmy beatitude behind me. Wherefore it came to pass that he who ruled\r\nme by virtue of my most gentle lady was made visible to my mind, in\r\nthe light habit of a traveller, coarsely fashioned. He appeared to me\r\ntroubled, and looked always on the ground; saving only that sometimes\r\nhis eyes were turned towards a river which was clear and rapid, and\r\nwhich flowed along the path I was taking. And then I thought that Love\r\ncalled me and said to me these words: \"I come from that lady who was\r\nso long thy surety; for the matter of whose return, I know that it may\r\nnot be. Wherefore I have taken that heart which I made thee leave with\r\nher, and do bear it unto another lady, who, as she was, shall be thy\r\nsurety;\" (and when he named her I knew her well). \"And of these words\r\nI have spoken, if thou shouldst speak any again, let it be in such\r\nsort as that none shall perceive thereby that thy love was feigned for\r\nher, which thou must now feign for another.\" And when he had spoken\r\nthus, all my imagining was gone suddenly, for it seemed to me that Love\r\nbecame a part of myself: so that, changed as it were in mine aspect, I\r\nrode on full of thought the whole of that day, and with heavy sighing.\r\nAnd the day being over, I wrote this sonnet:--\r\n\r\n    A day agone, as I rode sullenly\r\n      Upon a certain path that liked me not,\r\n      I met Love midway while the air was hot,\r\n    Clothed lightly as a wayfarer might be.\r\n    And for the cheer he showed, he seemed to me\r\n      As one who hath lost lordship he had got;\r\n      Advancing tow'rds me full of sorrowful thought,\r\n    Bowing his forehead so that none should see.\r\n    Then as I went, he called me by my name,\r\n      Saying: \"I journey since the morn was dim\r\n        Thence where I made thy heart to be: which now\r\n    I needs must bear unto another dame.\"\r\n      Wherewith so much passed into me of him\r\n        That he was gone, and I discerned not how.\r\n\r\n_This sonnet has three parts. In the first part, I tell how I met Love,\r\nand of his aspect. In the second, I tell what he said to me, although\r\nnot in full, through the fear I had of discovering my secret. In the\r\nthird, I say how he disappeared. The second part commences here, \"Then\r\nas I went;\" the third here, \"Wherewith so much.\"_\r\n\r\nOn my return, I set myself to seek out that lady whom my master had\r\nnamed to me while I journeyed sighing. And because I would be brief,\r\nI will now narrate that in a short while I made her my surety, in such\r\nsort that the matter was spoken of by many in terms scarcely courteous;\r\nthrough the which I had oftenwhiles many troublesome hours. And by\r\nthis it happened (to wit: by this false and evil rumour which seemed\r\nto misfame me of vice) that she who was the destroyer of all evil and\r\nthe queen of all good, coming where I was, denied me her most sweet\r\nsalutation, in the which alone was my blessedness.\r\n\r\nAnd here it is fitting for me to depart a little from this present\r\nmatter, that it may be rightly understood of what surpassing virtue her\r\nsalutation was to me. To the which end I say that when she appeared in\r\nany place, it seemed to me, by the hope of her excellent salutation,\r\nthat there was no man mine enemy any longer; and such warmth of charity\r\ncame upon me that most certainly in that moment I would have pardoned\r\nwhosoever had done me an injury; and if one should then have questioned\r\nme concerning any matter, I could only have said unto him \"Love,\" with\r\na countenance clothed in humbleness. And what time she made ready to\r\nsalute me, the spirit of Love, destroying all other perceptions, thrust\r\nforth the feeble spirits of my eyes, saying, \"Do homage unto your\r\nmistress,\" and putting itself in their place to obey: so that he who\r\nwould, might then have beheld Love, beholding the lids of mine eyes\r\nshake. And when this most gentle lady gave her salutation, Love, so far\r\nfrom being a medium beclouding mine intolerable beatitude, then bred\r\nin me such an overpowering sweetness that my body, being all subjected\r\nthereto, remained many times helpless and passive. Whereby it is made\r\nmanifest that in her salutation alone was there any beatitude for me,\r\nwhich then very often went beyond my endurance.\r\n\r\nAnd now, resuming my discourse, I will go on to relate that when, for\r\nthe first time, this beatitude was denied me, I became possessed with\r\nsuch grief that, parting myself from others, I went into a lonely place\r\nto bathe the ground with most bitter tears: and when, by this heat of\r\nweeping, I was somewhat relieved, I betook myself to my chamber, where\r\nI could lament unheard. And there, having prayed to the Lady of all\r\nMercies, and having said also, \"O Love, aid thou thy servant,\" I went\r\nsuddenly asleep like a beaten sobbing child. And in my sleep, towards\r\nthe middle of it, I seemed to see in the room, seated at my side, a\r\nyouth in very white raiment, who kept his eyes fixed on me in deep\r\nthought. And when he had gazed some time, I thought that he sighed and\r\ncalled to me in these words: \"_Fili mi, tempus est ut pr\u00e6termittantur\r\nsimulata nostra._\"[16] And thereupon I seemed to know him; for the\r\nvoice was the same wherewith he had spoken at other times in my sleep.\r\nThen looking at him, I perceived that he was weeping piteously, and\r\nthat he seemed to be waiting for me to speak. Wherefore, taking heart,\r\nI began thus: \"Why weepest thou, Master of all honour?\" And he made\r\nanswer to me: \"_Ego tanquam centrum circuli, cui simili modo se habent\r\ncircumferenti\u00e6 partes: tu autem non sic._\"[17] And thinking upon his\r\nwords, they seemed to me obscure; so that again compelling myself unto\r\nspeech, I asked of him: \"What thing is this, Master, that thou hast\r\nspoken thus darkly?\" To the which he made answer in the vulgar tongue:\r\n\"Demand no more than may be useful to thee.\" Whereupon I began to\r\ndiscourse with him concerning her salutation which she had denied me;\r\nand when I had questioned him of the cause, he said these words: \"Our\r\nBeatrice hath heard from certain persons, that the lady whom I named\r\nto thee while thou journeyedst full of sighs is sorely disquieted by\r\nthy solicitations: and therefore this most gracious creature, who is\r\nthe enemy of all disquiet, being fearful of such disquiet, refused to\r\nsalute thee. For the which reason (albeit, in very sooth, thy secret\r\nmust needs have become known to her by familiar observation) it is my\r\nwill that thou compose certain things in rhyme, in the which thou shalt\r\nset forth how strong a mastership I have obtained over thee, through\r\nher; and how thou wast hers even from thy childhood. Also do thou call\r\nupon him that knoweth these things to bear witness to them, bidding him\r\nto speak with her thereof; the which I, who am he, will do willingly.\r\nAnd thus she shall be made to know thy desire; knowing which, she shall\r\nknow likewise that they were deceived who spake of thee to her. And so\r\nwrite these things, that they shall seem rather to be spoken by a third\r\nperson; and not directly by thee to her, which is scarce fitting. After\r\nthe which, send them, not without me, where she may chance to hear\r\nthem; but have them fitted with a pleasant music, into the which I will\r\npass whensoever it needeth.\" With this speech he was away, and my sleep\r\nwas broken up.\r\n\r\n  [16] \"My son, it is time for us to lay aside our counterfeiting.\"\r\n\r\n  [17] \"I am as the centre of a circle, to the which all parts of\r\n       the circumference bear an equal relation: but with thee it\r\n       is not thus.\" This phrase seems to have remained as obscure\r\n       to commentators as Dante found it at the moment. No one, as\r\n       far as I know, has even fairly tried to find a meaning for\r\n       it. To me the following appears a not unlikely one. Love is\r\n       weeping on Dante's account, and not on his own. He says,\r\n       \"I am the centre of a circle (_Amor che muove il sole e\r\n       l'altre stelle_): therefore all lovable objects, whether in\r\n       heaven or earth, or any part of the circle's circumference,\r\n       are equally near to me. Not so thou, who wilt one day lose\r\n       Beatrice when she goes to heaven.\" The phrase would thus\r\n       contain an intimation of the death of Beatrice, accounting\r\n       for Dante being next told not to inquire the meaning of the\r\n       speech,--\"Demand no more than may be useful to thee.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon, remembering me, I knew that I had beheld this vision during\r\nthe ninth hour of the day; and I resolved that I would make a ditty,\r\nbefore I left my chamber, according to the words my master had spoken.\r\nAnd this is the ditty that I made:--\r\n\r\n    Song, 'tis my will that thou do seek out Love,\r\n      And go with him where my dear lady is;\r\n      That so my cause, the which thy harmonies\r\n    Do plead, his better speech may clearly prove.\r\n    Thou goest, my Song, in such a courteous kind,\r\n      That even companionless\r\n        Thou mayst rely on thyself anywhere.\r\n    And yet, an thou wouldst get thee a safe mind,\r\n      First unto Love address\r\n        Thy steps; whose aid, mayhap, 'twere ill to spare,\r\n        Seeing that she to whom thou mak'st thy prayer\r\n    Is, as I think, ill-minded unto me,\r\n    And that if Love do not companion thee,\r\n      Thou'lt have perchance small cheer to tell me of.\r\n\r\n    With a sweet accent, when thou com'st to her,\r\n      Begin thou in these words,\r\n        First having craved a gracious audience:\r\n    \"He who hath sent me as his messenger,\r\n    Lady, thus much records,\r\n        An thou but suffer him, in his defence.\r\n        Love, who comes with me, by thine influence\r\n    Can make this man do as it liketh him:\r\n    Wherefore, if this fault _is_ or doth but _seem_\r\n      Do thou conceive: for his heart cannot move.\"\r\n\r\n    Say to her also: \"Lady, his poor heart\r\n      Is so confirmed in faith\r\n        That all its thoughts are but of serving thee:\r\n    'Twas early thine, and could not swerve apart.\"\r\n      Then, if she wavereth,\r\n        Bid her ask Love, who knows if these things be.\r\n        And in the end, beg of her modestly\r\n    To pardon so much boldness: saying too:--\r\n    \"If thou declare his death to be thy due,\r\n      The thing shall come to pass, as doth behove.\"\r\n\r\n    Then pray thou of the Master of all ruth,\r\n      Before thou leave her there,\r\n        That he befriend my cause and plead it well.\r\n    \"In guerdon of my sweet rhymes and my truth\"\r\n      (Entreat him) \"stay with her;\r\n        Let not the hope of thy poor servant fail;\r\n        And if with her thy pleading should prevail,\r\n    Let her look on him and give peace to him.\"\r\n    Gentle my Song, if good to thee it seem,\r\n      Do this: so worship shall be thine and love.\r\n\r\n_This ditty is divided into three parts. In the first, I tell it\r\nwhither to go, and I encourage it, that it may go the more confidently,\r\nand I tell it whose company to join if it would go with confidence and\r\nwithout any danger. In the second, I say that which it behoves the\r\nditty to set forth. In the third, I give it leave to start when it\r\npleases, recommending its course to the arms of Fortune. The second\r\npart begins here, \"With a sweet accent;\" the third here, \"Gentle my\r\nSong.\" Some might contradict me, and say that they understand not whom\r\nI address in the second person, seeing that the ditty is merely the\r\nvery words I am speaking. And therefore I say that this doubt I intend\r\nto solve and clear up in this little book itself, at a more difficult\r\npassage, and then let him understand who now doubts, or would now\r\ncontradict as aforesaid._\r\n\r\nAfter this vision I have recorded, and having written those words which\r\nLove had dictated to me, I began to be harassed with many and divers\r\nthoughts, by each of which I was sorely tempted; and in especial,\r\nthere were four among them that left me no rest. The first was this:\r\n\"Certainly the lordship of Love is good; seeing that it diverts\r\nthe mind from all mean things.\" The second was this: \"Certainly the\r\nlordship of Love is evil; seeing that the more homage his servants pay\r\nto him, the more grievous and painful are the torments wherewith he\r\ntorments them.\" The third was this: \"The name of Love is so sweet in\r\nthe hearing that it would not seem possible for its effects to be other\r\nthan sweet; seeing that the name must needs be like unto the thing\r\nnamed; as it is written: _Nomina sunt consequentia rerum._\"[18] And the\r\nfourth was this: \"The lady whom Love hath chosen out to govern thee is\r\nnot as other ladies, whose hearts are easily moved.\"\r\n\r\n  [18] \"Names are the consequents of things.\"\r\n\r\nAnd by each one of these thoughts I was so sorely assailed that I was\r\nlike unto him who doubteth which path to take, and wishing to go, goeth\r\nnot. And if I bethought myself to seek out some point at the which all\r\nthese paths might be found to meet, I discerned but one way, and that\r\nirked me; to wit, to call upon Pity, and to commend myself unto her.\r\nAnd it was then that, feeling a desire to write somewhat thereof in\r\nrhyme, I wrote this sonnet:--\r\n\r\n    All my thoughts always speak to me of Love,\r\n      Yet have between themselves such difference\r\n      That while one bids me bow with mind and sense,\r\n    A second saith, \"Go to: look thou above;\"\r\n    The third one, hoping, yields me joy enough;\r\n      And with the last come tears, I scarce know whence:\r\n      All of them craving pity in sore suspense,\r\n    Trembling with fears that the heart knoweth of.\r\n    And thus, being all unsure which path to take,\r\n      Wishing to speak I know not what to say,\r\n        And lose myself in amorous wanderings:\r\n    Until, (my peace with all of them to make,)\r\n      Unto mine enemy I needs must pray,\r\n        My Lady Pity, for the help she brings.\r\n\r\n_This sonnet may be divided into four parts. In the first, I say and\r\npropound that all my thoughts are concerning Love. In the second, I say\r\nthat they are diverse, and I relate their diversity. In the third, I\r\nsay wherein they all seem to agree. In the fourth, I say that, wishing\r\nto speak of Love, I know not from which of these thoughts to take my\r\nargument; and that if I would take it from all, I shall have to call\r\nupon mine enemy, my Lady Pity. \"Lady\" I say, as in a scornful mode\r\nof speech. The second begins here, \"Yet have between themselves;\" the\r\nthird, \"All of them craving;\" the fourth, \"And thus.\"_\r\n\r\nAfter this battling with many thoughts, it chanced on a day that my\r\nmost gracious lady was with a gathering of ladies in a certain place;\r\nto the which I was conducted by a friend of mine; he thinking to do\r\nme a great pleasure by showing me the beauty of so many women. Then\r\nI, hardly knowing whereunto he conducted me, but trusting in him (who\r\nyet was leading his friend to the last verge of life), made question:\r\n\"To what end are we come among these ladies?\" and he answered: \"To the\r\nend that they may be worthily served.\" And they were assembled around\r\na gentlewoman who was given in marriage on that day; the custom of the\r\ncity being that these should bear her company when she sat down for the\r\nfirst time at table in the house of her husband. Therefore I, as was\r\nmy friend's pleasure, resolved to stay with him and do honour to those\r\nladies.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as I had thus resolved, I began to feel a faintness and\r\na throbbing at my left side, which soon took possession of my whole\r\nbody. Whereupon I remember that I covertly leaned my back unto a\r\npainting that ran round the walls of that house; and being fearful\r\nlest my trembling should be discerned of them, I lifted mine eyes\r\nto look on those ladies, and then first perceived among them the\r\nexcellent Beatrice. And when I perceived her, all my senses were\r\noverpowered by the great lordship that Love obtained, finding himself\r\nso near unto that most gracious being, until nothing but the spirits\r\nof sight remained to me; and even these remained driven out of their\r\nown instruments because Love entered in that honoured place of theirs,\r\nthat so he might the better behold her. And although I was other than\r\nat first, I grieved for the spirits so expelled, which kept up a sore\r\nlament, saying: \"If he had not in this wise thrust us forth, we also\r\nshould behold the marvel of this lady.\" By this, many of her friends,\r\nhaving discerned my confusion, began to wonder; and together with\r\nherself, kept whispering of me and mocking me. Whereupon my friend, who\r\nknew not what to conceive, took me by the hands, and drawing me forth\r\nfrom among them, required to know what ailed me. Then, having first\r\nheld me at quiet for a space until my perceptions were come back to me,\r\nI made answer to my friend: \"Of a surety I have now set my feet on that\r\npoint of life, beyond the which he must not pass who would return.\"[19]\r\n\r\n  [19] It is difficult not to connect Dante's agony at this\r\n       wedding-feast with our knowledge that in her twenty-first year\r\n       Beatrice was wedded to Simone de' Bardi. That she herself was\r\n       the bride on this occasion might seem out of the question,\r\n       from the fact of its not being in any way so stated: but on\r\n       the other hand, Dante's silence throughout the _Vita Nuova_\r\n       as regards her marriage (which must have brought deep sorrow\r\n       even to his ideal love) is so startling, that we might almost\r\n       be led to conceive in this passage the only intimation of it\r\n       which he thought fit to give.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, leaving him, I went back to the room where I had wept\r\nbefore; and again weeping and ashamed, said: \"If this lady but knew\r\nof my condition, I do not think that she would thus mock at me; nay,\r\nI am sure that she must needs feel some pity.\" And in my weeping I\r\nbethought me to write certain words, in the which, speaking to her, I\r\nshould signify the occasion of my disfigurement, telling her also how\r\nI knew that she had no knowledge thereof: which, if it were known, I\r\nwas certain must move others to pity. And then, because I hoped that\r\nperadventure it might come into her hearing, I wrote this sonnet:--\r\n\r\n    Even as the others mock, thou mockest me;\r\n      Not dreaming, noble lady, whence it is\r\n      That I am taken with strange semblances,\r\n    Seeing thy face which is so fair to see:\r\n    For else, compassion would not suffer thee\r\n      To grieve my heart with such harsh scoffs as these.\r\n      Lo! Love, when thou art present, sits at ease,\r\n    And bears his mastership so mightily,\r\n    That all my troubled senses he thrusts out,\r\n      Sorely tormenting some, and slaying some,\r\n        Till none but he is left and has free range\r\n        To gaze on thee. This makes my face to change\r\n      Into another's; while I stand all dumb,\r\n    And hear my senses clamour in their rout.\r\n\r\n_This sonnet I divide not into parts, because a division is only\r\nmade to open the meaning of the thing divided: and this, as it is\r\nsufficiently manifest through the reasons given, has no need of\r\ndivision. True it is that, amid the words whereby is shown the occasion\r\nof this sonnet, dubious words are to be found; namely, when I say\r\nthat Love kills all my spirits, but that the visual remain in life,\r\nonly outside of their own instruments. And this difficulty it is\r\nimpossible for any to solve who is not in equal guise liege unto Love;\r\nand, to those who are so, that is manifest which would clear up the\r\ndubious words. And therefore it were not well for me to expound this\r\ndifficulty, inasmuch as my speaking would be either fruitless or else\r\nsuperfluous._\r\n\r\nA while after this strange disfigurement, I became possessed with a\r\nstrong conception which left me but very seldom, and then to return\r\nquickly. And it was this: \"Seeing that thou comest into such scorn by\r\nthe companionship of this lady, wherefore seekest thou to behold her?\r\nIf she should ask thee this thing, what answer couldst thou make unto\r\nher? yea, even though thou wert master of all thy faculties, and in\r\nno way hindered from answering.\" Unto the which, another very humble\r\nthought said in reply: \"If I were master of all my faculties, and in\r\nno way hindered from answering, I would tell her that no sooner do I\r\nimage to myself her marvellous beauty than I am possessed with a desire\r\nto behold her, the which is of so great strength that it kills and\r\ndestroys in my memory all those things which might oppose it; and it\r\nis therefore that the great anguish I have endured thereby is yet not\r\nenough to restrain me from seeking to behold her.\" And then, because\r\nof these thoughts, I resolved to write somewhat, wherein, having\r\npleaded mine excuse, I should tell her of what I felt in her presence.\r\nWhereupon I wrote this sonnet:--\r\n\r\n    The thoughts are broken in my memory,\r\n      Thou lovely Joy, whene'er I see thy face;\r\n      When thou art near me, Love fills up the space,\r\n    Often repeating, \"If death irk thee, fly.\"\r\n    My face shows my heart's colour, verily,\r\n      Which, fainting, seeks for any leaning-place;\r\n      Till, in the drunken terror of disgrace,\r\n    The very stones seem to be shrieking, \"Die!\"\r\n    It were a grievous sin, if one should not\r\n      Strive then to comfort my bewildered mind\r\n        (Though merely with a simple pitying)\r\n    For the great anguish which thy scorn has wrought\r\n      In the dead sight o' the eyes grown nearly blind,\r\n        Which look for death as for a blessed thing.\r\n\r\n_This sonnet is divided into two parts. In the first, I tell the cause\r\nwhy I abstain not from coming to this lady. In the second, I tell\r\nwhat befalls me through coming to her; and this part begins here \"When\r\nthou art near.\" And also this second part divides into five distinct\r\nstatements. For, in the first, I say what Love, counselled by Reason,\r\ntells me when I am near the lady. In the second, I set forth the state\r\nof my heart by the example of the face. In the third, I say how all\r\nground of trust fails me. In the fourth, I say that he sins who shows\r\nnot pity of me, which would give me some comfort. In the last, I say\r\nwhy people should take pity: namely, for the piteous look which comes\r\ninto mine eyes; which piteous look is destroyed, that is, appeareth not\r\nunto others, through the jeering of this lady, who draws to the like\r\naction those who peradventure would see this piteousness. The second\r\npart begins here, \"My face shows;\" the third, \"Till, in the drunken\r\nterror;\" the fourth, \"It were a grievous sin;\" the fifth, \"For the\r\ngreat anguish.\"_\r\n\r\nThereafter, this sonnet bred in me desire to write down in verse four\r\nother things touching my condition, the which things it seemed to me\r\nthat I had not yet made manifest. The first among these was the grief\r\nthat possessed me very often, remembering the strangeness which Love\r\nwrought in me; the second was, how Love many times assailed me so\r\nsuddenly and with such strength that I had no other life remaining\r\nexcept a thought which spake of my lady; the third was, how, when Love\r\ndid battle with me in this wise, I would rise up all colourless, if\r\nso I might see my lady, conceiving that the sight of her would defend\r\nme against the assault of Love, and altogether forgetting that which\r\nher presence brought unto me; and the fourth was, how, when I saw her,\r\nthe sight not only defended me not, but took away the little life that\r\nremained to me. And I said these four things in a sonnet, which is\r\nthis:--\r\n\r\n    At whiles (yea oftentimes) I muse over\r\n      The quality of anguish that is mine\r\n      Through Love: then pity makes my voice to pine,\r\n    Saying, \"Is any else thus, anywhere?\"\r\n    Love smiteth me, whose strength is ill to bear;\r\n      So that of all my life is left no sign\r\n      Except one thought; and that, because 'tis thine,\r\n    Leaves not the body but abideth there.\r\n    And then if I, whom other aid forsook,\r\n      Would aid myself, and innocent of art\r\n        Would fain have sight of thee as a last hope,\r\n    No sooner do I lift mine eyes to look\r\n      Than the blood seems as shaken from my heart,\r\n        And all my pulses beat at once and stop.\r\n\r\n_This sonnet is divided into four parts, four things being therein\r\nnarrated; and as these are set forth above, I only proceed to\r\ndistinguish the parts by their beginnings. Wherefore I say that the\r\nsecond part begins, \"Love smiteth me;\" the third, \"And then if I;\" the\r\nfourth, \"No sooner do I lift.\"_\r\n\r\nAfter I had written these three last sonnets, wherein I spake unto\r\nmy lady, telling her almost the whole of my condition, it seemed to\r\nme that I should be silent, having said enough concerning myself. But\r\nalbeit I spake not to her again, yet it behoved me afterward to write\r\nof another matter, more noble than the foregoing. And for that the\r\noccasion of what I then wrote may be found pleasant in the hearing, I\r\nwill relate it as briefly as I may.\r\n\r\nThrough the sore change in mine aspect, the secret of my heart was\r\nnow understood of many. Which thing being thus, there came a day when\r\ncertain ladies to whom it was well known (they having been with me\r\nat divers times in my trouble) were met together for the pleasure of\r\ngentle company. And as I was going that way by chance, (but I think\r\nrather by the will of fortune,) I heard one of them call unto me, and\r\nshe that called was a lady of very sweet speech. And when I had come\r\nclose up with them, and perceived that they had not among them mine\r\nexcellent lady, I was reassured; and saluted them, asking of their\r\npleasure. The ladies were many; divers of whom were laughing one to\r\nanother, while divers gazed at me as though I should speak anon. But\r\nwhen I still spake not, one of them, who before had been talking with\r\nanother, addressed me by my name, saying, \"To what end lovest thou this\r\nlady, seeing that thou canst not support her presence? Now tell us this\r\nthing, that we may know it: for certainly the end of such a love must\r\nbe worthy of knowledge.\" And when she had spoken these words, not she\r\nonly, but all they that were with her, began to observe me, waiting\r\nfor my reply. Whereupon I said thus unto them:--\"Ladies, the end and\r\naim of my Love was but the salutation of that lady of whom I conceive\r\nthat ye are speaking; wherein alone I found that beatitude which is\r\nthe goal of desire. And now that it hath pleased her to deny me this,\r\nLove, my Master, of his great goodness, hath placed all my beatitude\r\nthere where my hope will not fail me.\" Then those ladies began to talk\r\nclosely together; and as I have seen snow fall among the rain, so was\r\ntheir talk mingled with sighs. But after a little, that lady who had\r\nbeen the first to address me, addressed me again in these words: \"We\r\npray thee that thou wilt tell us wherein abideth this thy beatitude.\"\r\nAnd answering, I said but thus much: \"In those words that do praise my\r\nlady.\" To the which she rejoined: \"If thy speech were true, those words\r\nthat thou didst write concerning thy condition would have been written\r\nwith another intent.\"\r\n\r\nThen I, being almost put to shame because of her answer, went out\r\nfrom among them; and as I walked, I said within myself: \"Seeing that\r\nthere is so much beatitude in those words which do praise my lady,\r\nwherefore hath my speech of her been different?\" And then I resolved\r\nthat thenceforward I would choose for the theme of my writings only the\r\npraise of this most gracious being. But when I had thought exceedingly,\r\nit seemed to me that I had taken to myself a theme which was much\r\ntoo lofty, so that I dared not begin; and I remained during several\r\ndays in the desire of speaking, and the fear of beginning. After\r\nwhich it happened, as I passed one day along a path which lay beside\r\na stream of very clear water, that there came upon me a great desire\r\nto say somewhat in rhyme: but when I began thinking how I should say\r\nit, methought that to speak of her were unseemly, unless I spoke to\r\nother ladies in the second person; which is to say, not to _any_ other\r\nladies, but only to such as are so called because they are gentle, let\r\nalone for mere womanhood. Whereupon I declare that my tongue spake as\r\nthough by its own impulse, and said, \"Ladies that have intelligence in\r\nlove.\" These words I laid up in my mind with great gladness, conceiving\r\nto take them as my commencement. Wherefore, having returned to the city\r\nI spake of, and considered thereof during certain days, I began a poem\r\nwith this beginning, constructed in the mode which will be seen below\r\nin its division. The poem begins here:--\r\n\r\n    Ladies that have intelligence in love,\r\n      Of mine own lady I would speak with you;\r\n      Not that I hope to count her praises through,\r\n        But telling what I may, to ease my mind.\r\n    And I declare that when I speak thereof,\r\n    Love sheds such perfect sweetness over me\r\n    That if my courage failed not, certainly\r\n        To him my listeners must be all resign'd.\r\n        Wherefore I will not speak in such large kind\r\n    That mine own speech should foil me, which were base;\r\n    But only will discourse of her high grace\r\n        In these poor words, the best that I can find,\r\n    With you alone, dear dames and damozels:\r\n    'Twere ill to speak thereof with any else.\r\n\r\n    An Angel, of his blessed knowledge, saith\r\n      To God: \"Lord, in the world that Thou hast made,\r\n      A miracle in action is display'd,\r\n        By reason of a soul whose splendours fare\r\n    Even hither: and since Heaven requireth\r\n    Nought saving her, for her it prayeth Thee,\r\n    Thy Saints crying aloud continually.\"\r\n        Yet Pity still defends our earthly share\r\n        In that sweet soul; God answering thus the prayer:\r\n    \"My well-belov\u00e8d, suffer that in peace\r\n    Your hope remain, while so My pleasure is,\r\n        There where one dwells who dreads the loss of her:\r\n    And who in Hell unto the doomed shall say,\r\n    'I have looked on that for which God's chosen pray.'\"\r\n\r\n    My lady is desired in the high Heaven:\r\n      _Wherefore_, it now behoveth me to tell,\r\n      Saying: Let any maid that would be well\r\n        Esteemed keep with her: for as she goes by,\r\n    Into foul hearts a deathly chill is driven\r\n    By Love, that makes ill thought to perish there:\r\n    While any who endures to gaze on her\r\n        Must either be ennobled, or else die.\r\n        When one deserving to be raised so high\r\n    Is found, 'tis then her power attains its proof,\r\n    Making his heart strong for his soul's behoof\r\n        With the full strength of meek humility.\r\n    Also this virtue owns she, by God's will:\r\n    Who speaks with her can never come to ill.\r\n\r\n    Love saith concerning her: \"How chanceth it\r\n      That flesh, which is of dust, should be thus pure?\"\r\n      Then, gazing always, he makes oath: \"Forsure,\r\n        This is a creature of God till now unknown.\"\r\n    She hath that paleness of the pearl that's fit\r\n    In a fair woman, so much and not more;\r\n    She is as high as Nature's skill can soar;\r\n        Beauty is tried by her comparison.\r\n        Whatever her sweet eyes are turned upon,\r\n    Spirits of love do issue thence in flame,\r\n    Which through their eyes who then may look on them\r\n        Pierce to the heart's deep chamber every one.\r\n    And in her smile Love's image you may see;\r\n    Whence none can gaze upon her steadfastly.\r\n\r\n    Dear Song, I know thou wilt hold gentle speech\r\n      With many ladies, when I send thee forth:\r\n      Wherefore (being mindful that thou hadst thy birth\r\n        From Love, and art a modest, simple child),\r\n    Whomso thou meetest, say thou this to each:\r\n    \"Give me good speed! To her I wend along\r\n    In whose much strength my weakness is made strong.\"\r\n        And if, i' the end, thou wouldst not be beguiled\r\n        Of all thy labour, seek not the defiled\r\n    And common sort; but rather choose to be\r\n    Where man and woman dwell in courtesy.\r\n        So to the road thou shalt be reconciled,\r\n    And find the lady, and with the lady, Love.\r\n    Commend thou me to each, as doth behove.\r\n\r\n_This poem, that it may be better understood, I will divide more\r\nsubtly than the others preceding; and therefore I will make three\r\nparts of it. The first part is a proem to the words following. The\r\nsecond is the matter treated of. The third is, as it were, a handmaid\r\nto the preceding words. The second begins here, \"An Angel;\" the third\r\nhere, \"Dear Song, I know.\" The first part is divided into four. In\r\nthe first, I say to whom I mean to speak of my lady, and wherefore I\r\nwill so speak. In the second, I say what she appears to myself to be\r\nwhen I reflect upon her excellence, and what I would utter if I lost\r\nnot courage. In the third, I say what it is I purpose to speak so as\r\nnot to be impeded by faintheartedness. In the fourth, repeating to\r\nwhom I purpose speaking, I tell the reason why I speak to them. The\r\nsecond begins here, \"And I declare;\" the third here, \"Wherefore I will\r\nnot speak;\" the fourth here, \"With you alone.\" Then, when I say \"An\r\nAngel,\" I begin treating of this lady: and this part is divided into\r\ntwo. In the first, I tell what is understood of her in heaven. In the\r\nsecond, I tell what is understood of her on earth: here, \"My lady is\r\ndesired.\" This second part is divided into two; for, in the first, I\r\nspeak of her as regards the nobleness of her soul, relating some of\r\nher virtues proceeding from her soul; in the second, I speak of her\r\nas regards the nobleness of her body, narrating some of her beauties:\r\nhere, \"Love saith concerning her.\" This second part is divided into\r\ntwo, for, in the first, I speak of certain beauties which belong to\r\nthe whole person; in the second, I speak of certain beauties which\r\nbelong to a distinct part of the person: here, \"Whatever her sweet\r\neyes.\" This second part is divided into two; for, in the one, I speak\r\nof the eyes, which are the beginning of love; in the second, I speak\r\nof the mouth, which is the end of love. And that every vicious thought\r\nmay be discarded herefrom, let the reader remember that it is above\r\nwritten that the greeting of this lady, which was an act of her mouth,\r\nwas the goal of my desires, while I could receive it. Then, when I say,\r\n\"Dear Song, I know,\" I add a stanza as it were handmaid to the others,\r\nwherein I say what I desire from this my poem. And because this last\r\npart is easy to understand, I trouble not myself with more divisions.\r\nI say, indeed, that the further to open the meaning of this poem, more\r\nminute divisions ought to be used; but nevertheless he who is not of\r\nwit enough to understand it by these which have been already made is\r\nwelcome to leave it alone; for certes, I fear I have communicated its\r\nsense to too many by these present divisions, if it so happened that\r\nmany should hear it._\r\n\r\nWhen this song was a little gone abroad, a certain one of my friends,\r\nhearing the same, was pleased to question me, that I should tell him\r\nwhat thing love is; it may be, conceiving from the words thus heard\r\na hope of me beyond my desert. Wherefore I, thinking that after such\r\ndiscourse it were well to say somewhat of the nature of Love, and also\r\nin accordance with my friend's desire, proposed to myself to write\r\ncertain words in the which I should treat of this argument. And the\r\nsonnet that I then made is this:--\r\n\r\n    Love and the gentle heart are one same thing,\r\n      Even as the wise man[20] in his ditty saith:\r\n      Each, of itself, would be such life in death\r\n    As rational soul bereft of reasoning.\r\n    'Tis Nature makes them when she loves: a king\r\n      Love is, whose palace where he sojourneth\r\n      Is called the Heart; there draws he quiet breath\r\n    At first, with brief or longer slumbering.\r\n    Then beauty seen in virtuous womankind\r\n      Will make the eyes desire, and through the heart\r\n        Send the desiring of the eyes again;\r\n    Where often it abides so long enshrin'd\r\n      That Love at length out of his sleep will start.\r\n        And women feel the same for worthy men.\r\n\r\n  [20] Guido Guinicelli, in the canzone which begins, \"Within the\r\n       gentle heart Love shelters him.\"\r\n\r\n_This sonnet is divided into two parts. In the first, I speak of him\r\naccording to his power. In the second, I speak of him according as\r\nhis power translates itself into act. The second part begins here,\r\n\"Then beauty seen.\" The first is divided into two. In the first, I\r\nsay in what subject this power exists. In the second, I say how this\r\nsubject and this power are produced together, and how the one regards\r\nthe other, as form does matter. The second begins here, \"'Tis Nature.\"\r\nAfterwards when I say, \"Then beauty seen in virtuous womankind,\" I\r\nsay how this power translates itself into act; and, first, how it\r\nso translates itself in a man, then how it so translates itself in a\r\nwoman: here, \"And women feel.\"_\r\n\r\nHaving treated of love in the foregoing, it appeared to me that I\r\nshould also say something in praise of my lady, wherein it might be\r\nset forth how love manifested itself when produced by her; and how not\r\nonly she could awaken it where it slept, but where it was not she could\r\nmarvellously create it. To the which end I wrote another sonnet; and it\r\nis this:--\r\n\r\n    My lady carries love within her eyes;\r\n      All that she looks on is made pleasanter;\r\n      Upon her path men turn to gaze at her;\r\n    He whom she greeteth feels his heart to rise,\r\n    And droops his troubled visage, full of sighs,\r\n      And of his evil heart is then aware:\r\n      Hate loves, and pride becomes a worshipper.\r\n    O women, help to praise her in somewise.\r\n    Humbleness, and the hope that hopeth well,\r\n      By speech of hers into the mind are brought,\r\n        And who beholds is bless\u00e8d oftenwhiles.\r\n        The look she hath when she a little smiles\r\n      Cannot be said, nor holden in the thought;\r\n    'Tis such a new and gracious miracle.\r\n\r\n_This sonnet has three sections. In the first, I say how this lady\r\nbrings this power into action by those most noble features, her eyes;\r\nand, in the third, I say this same as to that most noble feature, her\r\nmouth. And between these two sections is a little section, which asks,\r\nas it were, help for the previous section and the subsequent; and it\r\nbegins here, \"O women, help.\" The third begins here, \"Humbleness.\" The\r\nfirst is divided into three; for, in the first, I say how she with\r\npower makes noble that which she looks upon; and this is as much as\r\nto say that she brings Love, in power, thither where he is not. In the\r\nsecond, I say how she brings Love, in act, into the hearts of all those\r\nwhom she sees. In the third, I tell what she afterwards, with virtue,\r\noperates upon their hearts. The second begins, \"Upon her path;\" the\r\nthird, \"He whom she greeteth.\" Then, when I say, \"O women, help,\" I\r\nintimate to whom it is my intention to speak, calling on women to help\r\nme to honour her. Then, when I say, \"Humbleness,\" I say that same which\r\nis said in the first part, regarding two acts of her mouth, one whereof\r\nis her most sweet speech, and the other her marvellous smile. Only, I\r\nsay not of this last how it operates upon the hearts of others, because\r\nmemory cannot retain this smile, nor its operation._\r\n\r\nNot many days after this (it being the will of the most High God,\r\nwho also from Himself put not away death), the father of wonderful\r\nBeatrice, going out of this life, passed certainly into glory. Thereby\r\nit happened, as of very sooth it might not be otherwise, that this lady\r\nwas made full of the bitterness of grief: seeing that such a parting\r\nis very grievous unto those friends who are left, and that no other\r\nfriendship is like to that between a good parent and a good child;\r\nand furthermore considering that this lady was good in the supreme\r\ndegree, and her father (as by many it hath been truly averred) of\r\nexceeding goodness. And because it is the usage of that city that men\r\nmeet with men in such a grief, and women with women, certain ladies\r\nof her companionship gathered themselves unto Beatrice, where she kept\r\nalone in her weeping: and as they passed in and out, I could hear them\r\nspeak concerning her, how she wept. At length two of them went by me,\r\nwho said: \"Certainly she grieveth in such sort that one might die for\r\npity, beholding her.\" Then, feeling the tears upon my face, I put up\r\nmy hands to hide them: and had it not been that I hoped to hear more\r\nconcerning her (seeing that where I sat, her friends passed continually\r\nin and out), I should assuredly have gone thence to be alone, when I\r\nfelt the tears come. But as I still sat in that place, certain ladies\r\nagain passed near me, who were saying among themselves: \"Which of us\r\nshall be joyful any more, who have listened to this lady in her piteous\r\nsorrow?\" And there were others who said as they went by me: \"He that\r\nsitteth here could not weep more if he had beheld her as we have beheld\r\nher;\" and again: \"He is so altered that he seemeth not as himself.\" And\r\nstill as the ladies passed to and fro, I could hear them speak after\r\nthis fashion of her and of me.\r\n\r\nWherefore afterwards, having considered and perceiving that there was\r\nherein matter for poesy, I resolved that I would write certain rhymes\r\nin the which should be contained all that those ladies had said. And\r\nbecause I would willingly have spoken to them if it had not been for\r\ndiscreetness, I made in my rhymes as though I had spoken and they had\r\nanswered me. And thereof I wrote two sonnets; in the first of which\r\nI addressed them as I would fain have done; and in the second related\r\ntheir answer, using the speech that I had heard from them, as though it\r\nhad been spoken unto myself. And the sonnets are these:--\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n    You that thus wear a modest countenance\r\n      With lids weigh'd down by the heart's heaviness,\r\n      Whence come you, that among you every face\r\n    Appears the same, for its pale troubled glance?\r\n    Have you beheld my lady's face, perchance,\r\n      Bow'd with the grief that Love makes full of grace?\r\n      Say now, \"This thing is thus;\" as my heart says,\r\n    Marking your grave and sorrowful advance.\r\n    And if indeed you come from where she sighs\r\n      And mourns, may it please you (for his heart's relief)\r\n        To tell how it fares with her unto him\r\n    Who knows that you have wept, seeing your eyes,\r\n      And is so grieved with looking on your grief\r\n        That his heart trembles and his sight grows dim.\r\n\r\n_This sonnet is divided into two parts. In the first, I call and ask\r\nthese ladies whether they come from her, telling them that I think they\r\ndo, because they return the nobler. In the second, I pray them to tell\r\nme of her; and the second begins here, \"And if indeed.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n    Canst thou indeed be he that still would sing\r\n      Of our dear lady unto none but us?\r\n      For though thy voice confirms that it is thus,\r\n    Thy visage might another witness bring.\r\n    And wherefore is thy grief so sore a thing\r\n      That grieving thou mak'st others dolorous?\r\n      Hast thou too seen her weep, that thou from us\r\n    Canst not conceal thine inward sorrowing?\r\n    Nay, leave our woe to us: let us alone:\r\n      'Twere sin if one should strive to soothe our woe,\r\n        For in her weeping we have heard her speak:\r\n    Also her look's so full of her heart's moan\r\n      That they who should behold her, looking so,\r\n        Must fall aswoon, feeling all life grow weak.\r\n\r\n_This sonnet has four parts, as the ladies in whose person I reply\r\nhad four forms of answer. And, because these are sufficiently shown\r\nabove, I stay not to explain the purport of the parts, and therefore I\r\nonly discriminate them. The second begins here, \"And wherefore is thy\r\ngrief;\" the third here, \"Nay, leave our woe;\" the fourth, \"Also her\r\nlook.\"_\r\n\r\nA few days after this, my body became afflicted with a painful\r\ninfirmity, whereby I suffered bitter anguish for many days, which at\r\nlast brought me unto such weakness that I could no longer move. And I\r\nremember that on the ninth day, being overcome with intolerable pain, a\r\nthought came into my mind concerning my lady: but when it had a little\r\nnourished this thought, my mind returned to its brooding over mine\r\nenfeebled body. And then perceiving how frail a thing life is, even\r\nthough health keep with it, the matter seemed to me so pitiful that I\r\ncould not choose but weep; and weeping I said within myself: \"Certainly\r\nit must some time come to pass that the very gentle Beatrice will die.\"\r\nThen, feeling bewildered, I closed mine eyes; and my brain began to be\r\nin travail as the brain of one frantic, and to have such imaginations\r\nas here follow.\r\n\r\nAnd at the first, it seemed to me that I saw certain faces of women\r\nwith their hair loosened, which called out to me, \"Thou shalt surely\r\ndie;\" after the which, other terrible and unknown appearances said\r\nunto me, \"Thou art dead.\" At length, as my phantasy held on in its\r\nwanderings, I came to be I knew not where, and to behold a throng of\r\ndishevelled ladies wonderfully sad, who kept going hither and thither\r\nweeping. Then the sun went out, so that the stars showed themselves,\r\nand they were of such a colour that I knew they must be weeping:\r\nand it seemed to me that the birds fell dead out of the sky, and\r\nthat there were great earthquakes. With that, while I wondered in\r\nmy trance, and was filled with a grievous fear, I conceived that a\r\ncertain friend came unto me and said: \"Hast thou not heard? She that\r\nwas thine excellent lady hath been taken out of life.\" Then I began to\r\nweep very piteously; and not only in mine imagination, but with mine\r\neyes, which were wet with tears. And I seemed to look towards Heaven,\r\nand to behold a multitude of angels who were returning upwards, having\r\nbefore them an exceedingly white cloud: and these angels were singing\r\ntogether gloriously, and the words of their song were these: \"_Osanna\r\nin excelsis_;\" and there was no more that I heard. Then my heart that\r\nwas so full of love said unto me: \"It is true that our lady lieth\r\ndead;\" and it seemed to me that I went to look upon the body wherein\r\nthat blessed and most noble spirit had had its abiding-place. And so\r\nstrong was this idle imagining, that it made me to behold my lady in\r\ndeath; whose head certain ladies seemed to be covering with a white\r\nveil; and who was so humble of her aspect that it was as though she\r\nhad said, \"I have attained to look on the beginning of peace.\" And\r\ntherewithal I came unto such humility by the sight of her, that I cried\r\nout upon Death, saying: \"Now come unto me, and be not bitter against\r\nme any longer: surely, there where thou hast been, thou hast learned\r\ngentleness. Wherefore come now unto me who do greatly desire thee:\r\nseest thou not that I wear thy colour already?\" And when I had seen\r\nall those offices performed that are fitting to be done unto the dead,\r\nit seemed to me that I went back unto mine own chamber, and looked up\r\ntowards Heaven. And so strong was my phantasy, that I wept again in\r\nvery truth, and said with my true voice: \"O excellent soul! how blessed\r\nis he that now looketh upon thee!\"\r\n\r\nAnd as I said these words, with a painful anguish of sobbing and\r\nanother prayer unto Death, a young and gentle lady, who had been\r\nstanding beside me where I lay, conceiving that I wept and cried out\r\nbecause of the pain of mine infirmity, was taken with trembling and\r\nbegan to shed tears. Whereby other ladies, who were about the room,\r\nbecoming aware of my discomfort by reason of the moan that she made,\r\n(who indeed was of my very near kindred,) led her away from where I\r\nwas, and then set themselves to awaken me, thinking that I dreamed, and\r\nsaying: \"Sleep no longer, and be not disquieted.\"\r\n\r\nThen, by their words, this strong imagination was brought suddenly to\r\nan end, at the moment that I was about to say, \"O Beatrice! peace be\r\nwith thee.\" And already I had said, \"O Beatrice!\" when being aroused,\r\nI opened mine eyes, and knew that it had been a deception. But albeit\r\nI had indeed uttered her name, yet my voice was so broken with sobs,\r\nthat it was not understood by these ladies; so that in spite of the\r\nsore shame that I felt, I turned towards them by Love's counselling.\r\nAnd when they beheld me, they began to say, \"He seemeth as one dead,\"\r\nand to whisper among themselves, \"Let us strive if we may not comfort\r\nhim.\" Whereupon they spake to me many soothing words, and questioned\r\nme moreover touching the cause of my fear. Then I, being somewhat\r\nreassured, and having perceived that it was a mere phantasy, said unto\r\nthem, \"This thing it was that made me afeard;\" and told them of all\r\nthat I had seen, from the beginning even unto the end, but without\r\nonce speaking the name of my lady. Also, after I had recovered from my\r\nsickness, I bethought me to write these things in rhyme; deeming it a\r\nlovely thing to be known. Whereof I wrote this poem:--\r\n\r\n    A very pitiful lady, very young,\r\n      Exceeding rich in human sympathies,\r\n        Stood by, what time I clamour'd upon Death;\r\n    And at the wild words wandering on my tongue\r\n      And at the piteous look within mine eyes\r\n        She was affrighted, that sobs choked her breath.\r\n        So by her weeping where I lay beneath,\r\n    Some other gentle ladies came to know\r\n    My state, and made her go:\r\n      Afterward, bending themselves over me,\r\n      One said, \"Awaken thee!\"\r\n        And one, \"What thing thy sleep disquieteth?\"\r\n    With that, my soul woke up from its eclipse,\r\n    The while my lady's name rose to my lips:\r\n\r\n    But utter'd in a voice so sob-broken,\r\n      So feeble with the agony of tears,\r\n        That I alone might hear it in my heart;\r\n    And though that look was on my visage then\r\n      Which he who is ashamed so plainly wears,\r\n        Love made that I through shame held not apart,\r\n        But gazed upon them. And my hue was such\r\n    That they look'd at each other and thought of death;\r\n    Saying under their breath\r\n      Most tenderly, \"O let us comfort him:\"\r\n      Then unto me: \"What dream\r\n        Was thine, that it hath shaken thee so much?\"\r\n    And when I was a little comforted,\r\n    \"This, ladies, was the dream I dreamt,\" I said.\r\n\r\n    \"I was a-thinking how life fails with us\r\n      Suddenly after such a little while;\r\n        When Love sobb'd in my heart, which is his home.\r\n    Whereby my spirit wax'd so dolorous\r\n      That in myself I said, with sick recoil:\r\n        'Yea, to my lady too this Death must come.'\r\n        And therewithal such a bewilderment\r\n    Possess'd me, that I shut mine eyes for peace;\r\n    And in my brain did cease\r\n      Order of thought, and every healthful thing.\r\n      Afterwards, wandering\r\n        Amid a swarm of doubts that came and went,\r\n    Some certain women's faces hurried by,\r\n    And shriek'd to me, 'Thou too shalt die, shalt die!'\r\n\r\n    \"Then saw I many broken hinted sights\r\n      In the uncertain state I stepp'd into.\r\n        Meseem'd to be I know not in what place,\r\n    Where ladies through the street, like mournful lights,\r\n      Ran with loose hair, and eyes that frighten'd you\r\n        By their own terror, and a pale amaze:\r\n        The while, little by little, as I thought,\r\n    The sun ceased, and the stars began to gather,\r\n    And each wept at the other;\r\n      And birds dropp'd in mid-flight out of the sky;\r\n      And earth shook suddenly;\r\n        And I was 'ware of one, hoarse and tired out,\r\n    Who ask'd of me: 'Hast thou not heard it said?...\r\n    Thy lady, she that was so fair, is dead.'\r\n\r\n    \"Then lifting up mine eyes, as the tears came,\r\n      I saw the Angels, like a rain of manna,\r\n        In a long flight flying back Heavenward;\r\n    Having a little cloud in front of them,\r\n      After the which they went and said, 'Hosanna;'\r\n        And if they had said more, you should have heard.\r\n        Then Love said, 'Now shall all things be made clear:\r\n    Come and behold our lady where she lies.'\r\n    These 'wildering phantasies\r\n      Then carried me to see my lady dead.\r\n      Even as I there was led,\r\n        Her ladies with a veil were covering her;\r\n    And with her was such very humbleness\r\n    That she appeared to say, 'I am at peace.'\r\n\r\n    \"And I became so humble in my grief,\r\n      Seeing in her such deep humility,\r\n        That I said: 'Death, I hold thee passing good\r\n    Henceforth, and a most gentle sweet relief,\r\n      Since my dear love has chosen to dwell with thee:\r\n        Pity, not hate, is thine, well understood.\r\n        Lo! I do so desire to see thy face\r\n    That I am like as one who nears the tomb;\r\n    My soul entreats thee, Come.'\r\n      Then I departed, having made my moan;\r\n      And when I was alone\r\n        I said, and cast my eyes to the High Place:\r\n    'Blessed is he, fair soul, who meets thy glance!'\r\n    ... Just then you woke me, of your complaisa\u00f9nce.\"\r\n\r\n_This poem has two parts. In the first, speaking to a person undefined,\r\nI tell how I was aroused from a vain phantasy by certain ladies, and\r\nhow I promised them to tell what it was. In the second, I say how I\r\ntold them. The second part begins here, \"I was a-thinking.\" The first\r\npart divides into two. In the first, I tell that which certain ladies,\r\nand which one singly, did and said because of my phantasy, before I had\r\nreturned into my right senses. In the second, I tell what these ladies\r\nsaid to me after I had left off this wandering: and it begins here,\r\n\"But uttered in a voice.\" Then, when I say, \"I was a-thinking,\" I say\r\nhow I told them this my imagination; and concerning this I have two\r\nparts. In the first, I tell, in order, this imagination. In the second,\r\nsaying at what time they called me, I covertly thank them: and this\r\npart begins here, \"Just then you woke me.\"_\r\n\r\nAfter this empty imagining, it happened on a day, as I sat thoughtful,\r\nthat I was taken with such a strong trembling at the heart, that it\r\ncould not have been otherwise in the presence of my lady. Whereupon I\r\nperceived that there was an appearance of Love beside me, and I seemed\r\nto see him coming from my lady; and he said, not aloud but within my\r\nheart: \"Now take heed that thou bless the day when I entered into thee;\r\nfor it is fitting that thou shouldst do so.\" And with that my heart was\r\nso full of gladness, that I could hardly believe it to be of very truth\r\nmine own heart and not another.\r\n\r\nA short while after these words which my heart spoke to me with the\r\ntongue of Love, I saw coming towards me a certain lady who was very\r\nfamous for her beauty, and of whom that friend whom I have already\r\ncalled the first among my friends had long been enamoured. This lady's\r\nright name was Joan; but because of her comeliness (or at least it\r\nwas so imagined) she was called of many _Primavera_ (Spring), and\r\nwent by that name among them. Then looking again, I perceived that\r\nthe most noble Beatrice followed after her. And when both these ladies\r\nhad passed by me, it seemed to me that Love spake again in my heart,\r\nsaying: \"She that came first was called Spring, only because of that\r\nwhich was to happen on this day. And it was I myself who caused that\r\nname to be given her; seeing that as the Spring cometh first in the\r\nyear, so should she come first on this day,[21] when Beatrice was to\r\nshow herself after the vision of her servant. And even if thou go about\r\nto consider her right name, it is also as one should say, 'She shall\r\ncome first;' inasmuch as her name, Joan, is taken from that John who\r\nwent before the True Light, saying: '_Ego vox clamantis in deserto:\r\nParate viam Domini._'\"[22] And also it seemed to me that he added other\r\nwords, to wit: \"He who should inquire delicately touching this matter,\r\ncould not but call Beatrice by mine own name, which is to say, Love;\r\nbeholding her so like unto me.\"\r\n\r\n  [21] There is a play in the original upon the words _Primavera_\r\n       (Spring) and _prima verr\u00e0_ (she shall come first), to which I\r\n       have given as near an equivalent as I could.\r\n\r\n  [22] \"I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare ye\r\n       the way of the Lord.'\"\r\n\r\nThen I, having thought of this, imagined to write it with rhymes and\r\nsend it unto my chief friend; but setting aside certain words[23] which\r\nseemed proper to be set aside, because I believed that his heart still\r\nregarded the beauty of her that was called Spring.\r\n\r\n  [23] That is (as I understand it), suppressing, from delicacy\r\n       towards his friend, the words in which Love describes Joan as\r\n       merely the forerunner of Beatrice. And perhaps in the latter\r\n       part of this sentence a reproach is gently conveyed to the\r\n       fickle Guido Cavalcanti, who may already have transferred his\r\n       homage (though Dante had not then learned it) from Joan to\r\n       Mandetta.\r\n\r\nAnd I wrote this sonnet:--\r\n\r\n    I felt a spirit of love begin to stir\r\n      Within my heart, long time unfelt till then;\r\n      And saw Love coming towards me, fair and fain\r\n    (That I scarce knew him for his joyful cheer),\r\n    Saying, \"Be now indeed my worshipper!\"\r\n      And in his speech he laugh'd and laugh'd again.\r\n      Then, while it was his pleasure to remain,\r\n    I chanced to look the way he had drawn near,\r\n    And saw the Ladies Joan and Beatrice\r\n      Approach me, this the other following,\r\n        One and a second marvel instantly.\r\n    And even as now my memory speaketh this,\r\n      Love spake it then: \"The first is christen'd Spring;\r\n        The second Love, she is so like to me.\"\r\n\r\n_This sonnet has many parts: whereof the first tells how I felt\r\nawakened within my heart the accustomed tremor, and how it seemed that\r\nLove appeared to me joyful from afar. The second says how it appeared\r\nto me that Love spake within my heart, and what was his aspect. The\r\nthird tells how, after he had in such wise been with me a space, I saw\r\nand heard certain things. The second part begins here, \"Saying, 'Be\r\nnow;'\" the third here, \"Then, while it was his pleasure.\" The third\r\npart divides into two. In the first, I say what I saw. In the second,\r\nI say what I heard; and it begins here, \"Love spake it then.\"_\r\n\r\nIt might be here objected unto me, (and even by one worthy of\r\ncontroversy,) that I have spoken of Love as though it were a thing\r\noutward and visible: not only a spiritual essence, but as a bodily\r\nsubstance also. The which thing, in absolute truth, is a fallacy;\r\nLove not being of itself a substance, but an accident of substance.\r\nYet that I speak of Love as though it were a thing tangible and even\r\nhuman, appears by three things which I say thereof. And firstly, I\r\nsay that I perceived Love coming towards me; whereby, seeing that _to\r\ncome_ bespeaks locomotion, and seeing also how philosophy teacheth us\r\nthat none but a corporeal substance hath locomotion, it seemeth that\r\nI speak of Love as of a corporeal substance. And secondly, I say that\r\nLove smiled: and thirdly, that Love spake; faculties (and especially\r\nthe risible faculty) which appear proper unto man: whereby it further\r\nseemeth that I speak of Love as of a man. Now that this matter may be\r\nexplained (as is fitting), it must first be remembered that anciently\r\nthey who wrote poems of Love wrote not in the vulgar tongue, but\r\nrather certain poets in the Latin tongue. I mean, among us, although\r\nperchance the same may have been among others, and although likewise,\r\nas among the Greeks, they were not writers of spoken language, but\r\nmen of letters, treated of these things.[24] And indeed it is not a\r\ngreat number of years since poetry began to be made in the vulgar\r\ntongue; the writing of rhymes in spoken language corresponding to\r\nthe writing in metre of Latin verse, by a certain analogy. And I say\r\nthat it is but a little while, because if we examine the language of\r\n_oco_ and the language of _s\u00ec_,[25] we shall not find in those tongues\r\nany written thing of an earlier date than the last hundred and fifty\r\nyears. Also the reason why certain of a very mean sort obtained at\r\nthe first some fame as poets is, that before them no man had written\r\nverses in the language of _s\u00ec_: and of these, the first was moved to\r\nthe writing of such verses by the wish to make himself understood of\r\na certain lady, unto whom Latin poetry was difficult. This thing is\r\nagainst such as rhyme concerning other matters than love; that mode of\r\nspeech having been first used for the expression of love alone.[26]\r\nWherefore, seeing that poets have a license allowed them that is not\r\nallowed unto the writers of prose, and seeing also that they who write\r\nin rhyme are simply poets in the vulgar tongue, it becomes fitting and\r\nreasonable that a larger license should be given to these than to other\r\nmodern writers; and that any metaphor or rhetorical similitude which\r\nis permitted unto poets, should also be counted not unseemly in the\r\nrhymers of the vulgar tongue. Thus, if we perceive that the former have\r\ncaused inanimate things to speak as though they had sense and reason,\r\nand to discourse one with another; yea, and not only actual things,\r\nbut such also as have no real existence, (seeing that they have made\r\nthings which are not, to speak; and oftentimes written of those which\r\nare merely accidents as though they were substances and things human);\r\nit should therefore be permitted to the latter to do the like; which\r\nis to say, not inconsiderately, but with such sufficient motive as may\r\nafterwards be set forth in prose.\r\n\r\n  [24] On reading Dante's treatise _De Vulgari Eloquio_, it will\r\n       be found that the distinction which he intends here is not\r\n       between one language, or dialect, and another; but between\r\n       \"vulgar speech\" (that is, the language handed down from mother\r\n       to son without any conscious use of grammar or syntax), and\r\n       language as regulated by grammarians and the laws of literary\r\n       composition, and which Dante calls simply \"Grammar.\" A great\r\n       deal might be said on the bearings of the present passage, but\r\n       it is no part of my plan to enter on such questions.\r\n\r\n  [25] _i.e._, the languages of Provence and Tuscany.\r\n\r\n  [26] It strikes me that this curious passage furnishes a reason,\r\n       hitherto (I believe) overlooked, why Dante put such of\r\n       his lyrical poems as relate to philosophy into the form of\r\n       love-poems. He liked writing in Italian rhyme rather than\r\n       Latin metre; he thought Italian rhyme ought to be confined\r\n       to love-poems: therefore whatever he wrote (at this age)\r\n       had to take the form of a love-poem. Thus any poem by Dante\r\n       not concerning love is later than his twenty-seventh year\r\n       (1291-2), when he wrote the prose of the _Vita Nuova_; the\r\n       poetry having been written earlier, at the time of the events\r\n       referred to.\r\n\r\nThat the Latin poets have done thus, appears through Virgil, where he\r\nsaith that Juno (to wit, a goddess hostile to the Trojans) spake unto\r\n\u00c6olus, master of the Winds; as it is written in the first book of the\r\n\u00c6neid, _\u00c6ole, namque tibi, etc._; and that this master of the Winds\r\nmade reply: _Tuus, o regina, quid optes--Explorare labor, mihi jussa\r\ncapessere fas est._ And through the same poet, the inanimate thing\r\nspeaketh unto the animate, in the third book of the \u00c6neid, where it is\r\nwritten: _Dardanid\u00e6 duri, etc._ With Lucan, the animate thing speaketh\r\nto the inanimate; as thus: _Multum, Roma, tamen debes civilibus armis._\r\nIn Horace, man is made to speak to his own intelligence as unto another\r\nperson; (and not only hath Horace done this, but herein he followeth\r\nthe excellent Homer), as thus in his Poetics: _Dic mihi, Musa, virum,\r\netc._ Through Ovid, Love speaketh as a human creature, in the beginning\r\nof his discourse _De Remediis Amoris_: as thus: _Bella mihi, video,\r\nbella parantur, ait._ By which ensamples this thing shall be made\r\nmanifest unto such as may be offended at any part of this my book.\r\nAnd lest some of the common sort should be moved to jeering hereat, I\r\nwill here add, that neither did these ancient poets speak thus without\r\nconsideration, nor should they who are makers of rhyme in our day\r\nwrite after the same fashion, having no reason in what they write; for\r\nit were a shameful thing if one should rhyme under the semblance of\r\nmetaphor or rhetorical similitude, and afterwards, being questioned\r\nthereof, should be unable to rid his words of such semblance, unto\r\ntheir right understanding. Of whom, (to wit, of such as rhyme thus\r\nfoolishly,) myself and the first among my friends do know many.\r\n\r\nBut returning to the matter of my discourse. This excellent lady, of\r\nwhom I spake in what hath gone before, came at last into such favour\r\nwith all men, that when she passed anywhere folk ran to behold her;\r\nwhich thing was a deep joy to me: and when she drew near unto any, so\r\nmuch truth and simpleness entered into his heart, that he dared neither\r\nto lift his eyes nor to return her salutation: and unto this, many who\r\nhave felt it can bear witness. She went along crowned and clothed with\r\nhumility, showing no whit of pride in all that she heard and saw: and\r\nwhen she had gone by, it was said of many, \"This is not a woman, but\r\none of the beautiful angels of Heaven:\" and there were some that said:\r\n\"This is surely a miracle; blessed be the Lord, who hath power to work\r\nthus marvellously.\" I say, of very sooth, that she showed herself so\r\ngentle and so full of all perfection, that she bred in those who looked\r\nupon her a soothing quiet beyond any speech; neither could any look\r\nupon her without sighing immediately. These things, and things yet\r\nmore wonderful, were brought to pass through her miraculous virtue.\r\nWherefore I, considering thereof and wishing to resume the endless tale\r\nof her praises, resolved to write somewhat wherein I might dwell on her\r\nsurpassing influence; to the end that not only they who had beheld her,\r\nbut others also, might know as much concerning her as words could give\r\nto the understanding. And it was then that I wrote this sonnet:--\r\n\r\n    My lady looks so gentle and so pure\r\n      When yielding salutation by the way,\r\n      That the tongue trembles and has nought to say,\r\n    And the eyes, which fain would see, may not endure.\r\n    And still, amid the praise she hears secure,\r\n      She walks with humbleness for her array;\r\n      Seeming a creature sent from Heaven to stay\r\n    On earth, and show a miracle made sure.\r\n    She is so pleasant in the eyes of men\r\n    That through the sight the inmost heart doth gain\r\n      A sweetness which needs proof to know it by:\r\n    And from between her lips there seems to move\r\n    A soothing essence that is full of love,\r\n      Saying for ever to the spirit, \"Sigh!\"\r\n\r\nThis sonnet is so easy to understand, from what is afore narrated,\r\nthat it needs no division; and therefore, leaving it, I say also that\r\nthis excellent lady came into such favour with all men, that not only\r\nshe herself was honoured and commended, but through her companionship,\r\nhonour and commendation came unto others. Wherefore I, perceiving this,\r\nand wishing that it should also be made manifest to those that beheld\r\nit not, wrote the sonnet here following; wherein is signified the power\r\nwhich her virtue had upon other ladies:--\r\n\r\n    For certain he hath seen all perfectness\r\n      Who among other ladies hath seen mine:\r\n      They that go with her humbly should combine\r\n    To thank their God for such peculiar grace.\r\n    So perfect is the beauty of her face\r\n      That it begets in no wise any sign\r\n      Of envy, but draws round her a clear line\r\n    Of love, and blessed faith, and gentleness.\r\n    Merely the sight of her makes all things bow:\r\n      Not she herself alone is holier\r\n        Than all; but hers, through her, are raised above.\r\n    From all her acts such lovely graces flow\r\n      That truly one may never think of her\r\n        Without a passion of exceeding love.\r\n\r\n_This sonnet has three parts. In the first, I say in what company this\r\nlady appeared most wondrous. In the second, I say how gracious was\r\nher society. In the third, I tell of the things which she, with power,\r\nworked upon others. The second begins here, \"They that go with her;\"\r\nthe third here, \"So perfect.\" This last part divides into three. In\r\nthe first, I tell what she operated upon women, that is, by their own\r\nfaculties. In the second, I tell what she operated in them through\r\nothers. In the third, I say how she not only operated in women, but in\r\nall people; and not only while herself present, but, by memory of her,\r\noperated wondrously. The second begins here, \"Merely the sight;\" the\r\nthird here, \"From all her acts.\"_\r\n\r\nThereafter on a day, I began to consider that which I had said of my\r\nlady: to wit, in these two sonnets aforegone: and becoming aware that\r\nI had not spoken of her immediate effect on me at that especial time,\r\nit seemed to me that I had spoken defectively. Whereupon I resolved\r\nto write somewhat of the manner wherein I was then subject to her\r\ninfluence, and of what her influence then was. And conceiving that\r\nI should not be able to say these things in the small compass of a\r\nsonnet, I began therefore a poem with this beginning:--\r\n\r\n    Love hath so long possessed me for his own\r\n      And made his lordship so familiar\r\n    That he, who at first irked me, is now grown\r\n      Unto my heart as its best secrets are.\r\n      And thus, when he in such sore wise doth mar\r\n    My life that all its strength seems gone from it,\r\n    Mine inmost being then feels throughly quit\r\n      Of anguish, and all evil keeps afar.\r\n    Love also gathers to such power in me\r\n      That my sighs speak, each one a grievous thing,\r\n      Always soliciting\r\n    My lady's salutation piteously.\r\n    Whenever she beholds me, it is so,\r\n    Who is more sweet than any words can show.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Quomodo sedet sola civitas plena populo! facta est quasi vidua domina\r\ngentium!_[27]\r\n\r\n  [27] \"How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people!\r\n       how is she become as a widow, she that was great among the\r\n       nations!\"--_Lamentations of Jeremiah_, i. I.\r\n\r\nI was still occupied with this poem, (having composed thereof only\r\nthe above-written stanza,) when the Lord God of justice called my most\r\ngracious lady unto Himself, that she might be glorious under the banner\r\nof that blessed Queen Mary, whose name had always a deep reverence in\r\nthe words of holy Beatrice. And because haply it might be found good\r\nthat I should say somewhat concerning her departure, I will herein\r\ndeclare what are the reasons which make that I shall not do so.\r\n\r\nAnd the reasons are three. The first is, that such matter belongeth\r\nnot of right to the present argument, if one consider the opening of\r\nthis little book. The second is, that even though the present argument\r\nrequired it, my pen doth not suffice to write in a fit manner of this\r\nthing. And the third is, that were it both possible and of absolute\r\nnecessity, it would still be unseemly for me to speak thereof, seeing\r\nthat thereby it must behove me to speak also mine own praises: a thing\r\nthat in whosoever doeth it is worthy of blame. For the which reasons,\r\nI will leave this matter to be treated of by some other than myself.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as the number nine, which number hath often had mention\r\nin what hath gone before, (and not, as it might appear, without\r\nreason,) seems also to have borne a part in the manner of her death:\r\nit is therefore right that I should say somewhat thereof. And for\r\nthis cause, having first said what was the part it bore herein, I\r\nwill afterwards point out a reason which made that this number was so\r\nclosely allied unto my lady.\r\n\r\nI say, then, that according to the division of time in Italy, her most\r\nnoble spirit departed from among us in the first hour of the ninth day\r\nof the month; and according to the division of time in Syria, in the\r\nninth month of the year: seeing that Tismim, which with us is October,\r\nis there the first month. Also she was taken from among us in that\r\nyear of our reckoning (to wit, of the years of our Lord) in which the\r\nperfect number was nine times multiplied within that century wherein\r\nshe was born into the world: which is to say, the thirteenth century of\r\nChristians.[28]\r\n\r\n  [28] Beatrice Portinari will thus be found to have died during the\r\n       first hour of the 9th of June, 1290. And from what Dante says\r\n       at the commencement of this work, (viz., that she was younger\r\n       than himself by eight or nine months,) it may also be gathered\r\n       that her age, at the time of her death, was twenty-four\r\n       years and three months. The \"perfect number\" mentioned in the\r\n       present passage is the number ten.\r\n\r\nAnd touching the reason why this number was so closely allied unto\r\nher, it may peradventure be this. According to Ptolemy (and also to\r\nthe Christian verity), the revolving heavens are nine; and according to\r\nthe common opinion among astrologers, these nine heavens together have\r\ninfluence over the earth. Wherefore it would appear that this number\r\nwas thus allied unto her for the purpose of signifying that, at her\r\nbirth, all these nine heavens were at perfect unity with each other\r\nas to their influence. This is one reason that may be brought: but\r\nmore narrowly considering, and according to the infallible truth, this\r\nnumber was her own self: that is to say, by similitude. As thus. The\r\nnumber three is the root of the number nine; seeing that without the\r\ninterposition of any other number, being multiplied merely by itself,\r\nit produceth nine, as we manifestly perceive that three times three\r\nare nine. Thus, three being of itself the efficient of nine, and the\r\nGreat Efficient of Miracles being of Himself Three Persons (to wit:\r\nthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit), which, being Three, are also\r\nOne:--this lady was accompanied by the number nine to the end that men\r\nmight clearly perceive her to be a nine, that is, a miracle, whose\r\nonly root is the Holy Trinity. It may be that a more subtile person\r\nwould find for this thing a reason of greater subtilty: but such is the\r\nreason that I find, and that liketh me best.\r\n\r\nAfter this most gracious creature had gone out from among us, the\r\nwhole city came to be as it were widowed and despoiled of all dignity.\r\nThen I, left mourning in this desolate city, wrote unto the principal\r\npersons thereof, in an epistle, concerning its condition; taking for\r\nmy commencement those words of Jeremias: _Quomodo sedet sola civitas!\r\netc._ And I make mention of this, that none may marvel wherefore I set\r\ndown these words before, in beginning to treat of her death. Also if\r\nany should blame me, in that I do not transcribe that epistle whereof I\r\nhave spoken, I will make it mine excuse that I began this little book\r\nwith the intent that it should be written altogether in the vulgar\r\ntongue; wherefore, seeing that the epistle I speak of is in Latin, it\r\nbelongeth not to mine undertaking: more especially as I know that my\r\nchief friend, for whom I write this book, wished also that the whole of\r\nit should be in the vulgar tongue.\r\n\r\nWhen mine eyes had wept for some while, until they were so weary with\r\nweeping that I could no longer through them give ease to my sorrow, I\r\nbethought me that a few mournful words might stand me instead of tears.\r\nAnd therefore I proposed to make a poem, that weeping I might speak\r\ntherein of her for whom so much sorrow had destroyed my spirit; and I\r\nthen began \"The eyes that weep.\"\r\n\r\n_That this poem may seem to remain the more widowed at its close,\r\nI will divide it before writing it; and this method I will observe\r\nhenceforward. I say that this poor little poem has three parts. The\r\nfirst is a prelude. In the second, I speak of her. In the third, I\r\nspeak pitifully to the poem. The second begins here, \"Beatrice is gone\r\nup;\" the third here, \"Weep, pitiful Song of mine.\" The first divides\r\ninto three. In the first, I say what moves me to speak. In the second,\r\nI say to whom I mean to speak. In the third, I say of whom I mean to\r\nspeak. The second begins here, \"And because often, thinking;\" the third\r\nhere, \"And I will say.\" Then, when I say, \"Beatrice is gone up,\" I\r\nspeak of her; and concerning this I have two parts. First, I tell the\r\ncause why she was taken away from us: afterwards, I say how one weeps\r\nher parting; and this part commences here, \"Wonderfully.\" This part\r\ndivides into three. In the first, I say who it is that weeps her not.\r\nIn the second, I say who it is that doth weep her. In the third, I\r\nspeak of my condition. The second begins here, \"But sighing comes, and\r\ngrief;\" the third, \"With sighs.\" Then, when I say, \"Weep, pitiful Song\r\nof mine,\" I speak to this my song, telling it what ladies to go to, and\r\nstay with._\r\n\r\n    The eyes that weep for pity of the heart\r\n      Have wept so long that their grief languisheth,\r\n        And they have no more tears to weep withal:\r\n    And now, if I would ease me of a part\r\n      Of what, little by little, leads to death,\r\n        It must be done by speech, or not at all.\r\n        And because often, thinking, I recall\r\n    How it was pleasant, ere she went afar,\r\n      To talk of her with you, kind damozels,\r\n      I talk with no one else,\r\n    But only with such hearts as women's are.\r\n      And I will say,--still sobbing as speech fails,--\r\n    That she hath gone to Heaven suddenly,\r\n    And hath left Love below, to mourn with me.\r\n\r\n    Beatrice is gone up into high Heaven,\r\n      The kingdom where the angels are at peace;\r\n        And lives with them; and to her friends is dead.\r\n    Not by the frost of winter was she driven\r\n      Away, like others; nor by summer-heats;\r\n        But through a perfect gentleness, instead.\r\n        For from the lamp of her meek lowlihead\r\n    Such an exceeding glory went up hence\r\n      That it woke wonder in the Eternal Sire,\r\n      Until a sweet desire\r\n    Entered Him for that lovely excellence,\r\n      So that He bade her to Himself aspire;\r\n    Counting this weary and most evil place\r\n    Unworthy of a thing so full of grace.\r\n\r\n    Wonderfully out of the beautiful form\r\n      Soared her clear spirit, waxing glad the while;\r\n        And is in its first home, there where it is.\r\n    Who speaks thereof, and feels not the tears warm\r\n      Upon his face, must have become so vile\r\n        As to be dead to all sweet sympathies.\r\n        Out upon him! an abject wretch like this\r\n    May not imagine anything of her,--\r\n      He needs no bitter tears for his relief.\r\n      But sighing comes, and grief,\r\n    And the desire to find no comforter,\r\n      (Save only Death, who makes all sorrow brief),\r\n    To him who for a while turns in his thought\r\n    How she hath been among us, and is not.\r\n\r\n    With sighs my bosom always laboureth\r\n      In thinking, as I do continually,\r\n        Of her for whom my heart now breaks apace;\r\n    And very often when I think of death,\r\n      Such a great inward longing comes to me\r\n        That it will change the colour of my face;\r\n        And, if the idea settles in its place,\r\n    All my limbs shake as with an ague-fit:\r\n      Till, starting up in wild bewilderment,\r\n      I do become so shent\r\n    That I go forth, lest folk misdoubt of it.\r\n      Afterward, calling with a sore lament\r\n    On Beatrice, I ask, \"Canst thou be dead?\"\r\n    And calling on her, I am comforted.\r\n\r\n    Grief with its tears, and anguish with its sighs,\r\n      Come to me now whene'er I am alone;\r\n        So that I think the sight of me gives pain.\r\n    And what my life hath been, that living dies,\r\n      Since for my lady the New Birth's begun,\r\n        I have not any language to explain.\r\n        And so, dear ladies, though my heart were fain,\r\n    I scarce could tell indeed how I am thus.\r\n      All joy is with my bitter life at war;\r\n      Yea, I am fallen so far\r\n    That all men seem to say, \"Go out from us,\"\r\n      Eyeing my cold white lips, how dead they are.\r\n    But she, though I be bowed unto the dust,\r\n    Watches me; and will guerdon me, I trust.\r\n    Weep, pitiful Song of mine, upon thy way,\r\n      To the dames going and the damozels\r\n      For whom and for none else\r\n    Thy sisters have made music many a day.\r\n    Thou, that art very sad and not as they,\r\n      Go dwell thou with them as a mourner dwells.\r\n\r\nAfter I had written this poem, I received the visit of a friend whom\r\nI counted as second unto me in the degrees of friendship, and who,\r\nmoreover, had been united by the nearest kindred to that most gracious\r\ncreature. And when we had a little spoken together, he began to solicit\r\nme that I would write somewhat in memory of a lady who had died; and he\r\ndisguised his speech, so as to seem to be speaking of another who was\r\nbut lately dead: wherefore I, perceiving that his speech was of none\r\nother than that blessed one herself, told him that it should be done\r\nas he required. Then afterwards, having thought thereof, I imagined to\r\ngive vent in a sonnet to some part of my hidden lamentations; but in\r\nsuch sort that it might seem to be spoken by this friend of mine, to\r\nwhom I was to give it. And the sonnet saith thus: \"Stay now with me,\"\r\netc.\r\n\r\n_This sonnet has two parts. In the first, I call the Faithful of Love\r\nto hear me. In the second, I relate my miserable condition. The second\r\nbegins here, \"Mark how they force.\"_\r\n\r\n    Stay now with me, and listen to my sighs,\r\n      Ye piteous hearts, as pity bids ye do.\r\n      Mark how they force their way out and press through;\r\n    If they be once pent up, the whole life dies.\r\n    Seeing that now indeed my weary eyes\r\n      Oftener refuse than I can tell to you\r\n      (Even though my endless grief is ever new),\r\n    To weep and let the smothered anguish rise.\r\n    Also in sighing ye shall hear me call\r\n      On her whose bless\u00e8d presence doth enrich\r\n        The only home that well befitteth her:\r\n    And ye shall hear a bitter scorn of all\r\n      Sent from the inmost of my spirit in speech\r\n        That mourns its joy and its joy's minister.\r\n\r\nBut when I had written this sonnet, bethinking me who he was to whom\r\nI was to give it, that it might appear to be his speech, it seemed\r\nto me that this was but a poor and barren gift for one of her so near\r\nkindred. Wherefore, before giving him this sonnet, I wrote two stanzas\r\nof a poem: the first being written in very sooth as though it were\r\nspoken by him, but the other being mine own speech, albeit, unto one\r\nwho should not look closely, they would both seem to be said by the\r\nsame person. Nevertheless, looking closely, one must perceive that it\r\nis not so, inasmuch as one does not call this most gracious creature\r\n_his lady_, and the other does, as is manifestly apparent. And I gave\r\nthe poem and the sonnet unto my friend, saying that I had made them\r\nonly for him.\r\n\r\n_The poem begins, \"Whatever while,\" and has two parts. In the first,\r\nthat is, in the first stanza, this my dear friend, her kinsman,\r\nlaments. In the second, I lament; that is, in the other stanza, which\r\nbegins, \"For ever.\" And thus it appears that in this poem two persons\r\nlament, of whom one laments as a brother, the other as a servant._\r\n\r\n    Whatever while the thought comes over me\r\n      That I may not again\r\n        Behold that lady whom I mourn for now,\r\n    About my heart my mind brings constantly\r\n      So much of extreme pain\r\n        That I say, Soul of mine, why stayest thou?\r\n        Truly the anguish, Soul, that we must bow\r\n    Beneath, until we win out of this life,\r\n      Gives me full oft a fear that trembleth:\r\n      So that I call on Death\r\n    Even as on Sleep one calleth after strife,\r\n      Saying, Come unto me. Life showeth grim\r\n      And bare; and if one dies, I envy him.\r\n\r\n    For ever, among all my sighs which burn,\r\n      There is a piteous speech\r\n        That clamours upon death continually:\r\n    Yea, unto him doth my whole spirit turn\r\n      Since first his hand did reach\r\n        My lady's life with most foul cruelty.\r\n        But from the height of woman's fairness, she,\r\n    Going up from us with the joy we had,\r\n      Grew perfectly and spiritually fair;\r\n      That so she spreads even there\r\n    A light of Love which makes the Angels glad,\r\n      And even unto their subtle minds can bring\r\n      A certain awe of profound marvelling.\r\n\r\nOn that day which fulfilled the year since my lady had been made of\r\nthe citizens of eternal life, remembering me of her as I sat alone, I\r\nbetook myself to draw the resemblance of an angel upon certain tablets.\r\nAnd while I did thus, chancing to turn my head, I perceived that some\r\nwere standing beside me to whom I should have given courteous welcome,\r\nand that they were observing what I did: also I learned afterwards that\r\nthey had been there a while before I perceived them. Perceiving whom,\r\nI arose for salutation, and said: \"Another was with me.\"[29]\r\n\r\n  [29] Thus according to some texts. The majority, however, add\r\n       the words, \"And therefore was I in thought:\" but the shorter\r\n       speech is perhaps the more forcible and pathetic.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, when they had left me, I set myself again to mine\r\noccupation, to wit, to the drawing figures of angels: in doing which, I\r\nconceived to write of this matter in rhyme, as for her anniversary, and\r\nto address my rhymes unto those who had just left me. It was then that\r\nI wrote the sonnet which saith, \"That lady;\" and as this sonnet hath\r\ntwo commencements, it behoveth me to divide it with both of them here.\r\n\r\n_I say that, according to the first, this sonnet has three parts. In\r\nthe first, I say that this lady was then in my memory. In the second,\r\nI tell what Love therefore did with me. In the third, I speak of the\r\neffects of Love. The second begins here, \"Love knowing;\" the third\r\nhere, \"Forth went they.\" This part divides into two. In the one, I say\r\nthat all my sighs issued speaking. In the other, I say how some spoke\r\ncertain words different from the others. The second begins here, \"And\r\nstill.\" In this same manner is it divided with the other beginning,\r\nsave that, in the first part, I tell when this lady had thus come into\r\nmy mind, and this I say not in the other._\r\n\r\n    That lady of all gentle memories\r\n      Had lighted on my soul;--whose new abode\r\n      Lies now, as it was well ordained of God,\r\n    Among the poor in heart, where Mary is.\r\n    Love, knowing that dear image to be his,\r\n      Woke up within the sick heart sorrow-bow'd,\r\n      Unto the sighs which are its weary load\r\n    Saying, \"Go forth.\" And they went forth, I wis;\r\n    Forth went they from my breast that throbbed and ached;\r\n      With such a pang as oftentimes will bathe\r\n        Mine eyes with tears when I am left alone.\r\n      And still those sighs which drew the heaviest breath\r\n    Came whispering thus: \"O noble intellect!\r\n        It is a year to-day that thou art gone.\"\r\n\r\nSecond Commencement.\r\n\r\n    That lady of all gentle memories\r\n      Had lighted on my soul;--for whose sake flow'd\r\n      The tears of Love; in whom the power abode\r\n    Which led you to observe while I did this.\r\n    Love, knowing that dear image to be his, etc.\r\n\r\nThen, having sat for some space sorely in thought because of the time\r\nthat was now past, I was so filled with dolorous imaginings that it\r\nbecame outwardly manifest in mine altered countenance. Whereupon,\r\nfeeling this and being in dread lest any should have seen me, I lifted\r\nmine eyes to look; and then perceived a young and very beautiful lady,\r\nwho was gazing upon me from a window with a gaze full of pity, so that\r\nthe very sum of pity appeared gathered together in her. And seeing that\r\nunhappy persons, when they beget compassion in others, are then most\r\nmoved unto weeping, as though they also felt pity for themselves, it\r\ncame to pass that mine eyes began to be inclined unto tears. Wherefore,\r\nbecoming fearful lest I should make manifest mine abject condition,\r\nI rose up, and went where I could not be seen of that lady; saying\r\nafterwards within myself: \"Certainly with her also must abide most\r\nnoble Love.\" And with that, I resolved upon writing a sonnet, wherein,\r\nspeaking unto her, I should say all that I have just said. And as this\r\nsonnet is very evident, I will not divide it:--\r\n\r\n    Mine eyes beheld the blessed pity spring\r\n      Into thy countenance immediately\r\n      A while agone, when thou beheldst in me\r\n    The sickness only hidden grief can bring;\r\n    And then I knew thou wast considering\r\n      How abject and forlorn my life must be;\r\n      And I became afraid that thou shouldst see\r\n    My weeping, and account it a base thing.\r\n    Therefore I went out from thee; feeling how\r\n      The tears were straightway loosened at my heart\r\n        Beneath thine eyes' compassionate control.\r\n        And afterwards I said within my soul:\r\n      \"Lo! with this lady dwells the counterpart\r\n    Of the same Love who holds me weeping now.\"\r\n\r\nIt happened after this, that whensoever I was seen of this lady, she\r\nbecame pale and of a piteous countenance, as though it had been with\r\nlove; whereby she remembered me many times of my own most noble lady,\r\nwho was wont to be of a like paleness. And I know that often, when I\r\ncould not weep nor in any way give ease unto mine anguish, I went to\r\nlook upon this lady, who seemed to bring the tears into my eyes by the\r\nmere sight of her. Of the which thing I bethought me to speak unto her\r\nin rhyme, and then made this sonnet: which begins, \"Love's pallor,\" and\r\nwhich is plain without being divided, by its exposition aforesaid:--\r\n\r\n    Love's pallor and the semblance of deep ruth\r\n      Were never yet shown forth so perfectly\r\n      In any lady's face, chancing to see\r\n    Grief's miserable countenance uncouth,\r\n    As in thine, lady, they have sprung to soothe,\r\n      When in mine anguish thou hast looked on me;\r\n      Until sometimes it seems as if, through thee,\r\n    My heart might almost wander from its truth.\r\n    Yet so it is, I cannot hold mine eyes\r\n      From gazing very often upon thine\r\n        In the sore hope to shed those tears they keep;\r\n    And at such time, thou mak'st the pent tears rise\r\n      Even to the brim, till the eyes waste and pine;\r\n        Yet cannot they, while thou art present, weep.\r\n\r\nAt length, by the constant sight of this lady, mine eyes began to be\r\ngladdened overmuch with her company; through which thing many times\r\nI had much unrest, and rebuked myself as a base person: also, many\r\ntimes I cursed the unsteadfastness of mine eyes, and said to them\r\ninwardly: \"Was not your grievous condition of weeping wont one while\r\nto make others weep? And will ye now forget this thing because a lady\r\nlooketh upon you? who so looketh merely in compassion of the grief ye\r\nthen showed for your own blessed lady. But whatso ye can, that do ye,\r\naccursed eyes! many a time will I make you remember it! for never, till\r\ndeath dry you up, should ye make an end of your weeping.\" And when\r\nI had spoken thus unto mine eyes, I was taken again with extreme and\r\ngrievous sighing. And to the end that this inward strife which I had\r\nundergone might not be hidden from all saving the miserable wretch who\r\nendured it, I proposed to write a sonnet, and to comprehend in it this\r\nhorrible condition. And I wrote this which begins, \"The very bitter\r\nweeping.\"\r\n\r\n_The sonnet has two parts. In the first, I speak to my eyes, as my\r\nheart spoke within myself. In the second, I remove a difficulty,\r\nshowing who it is that speaks thus: and this part begins here, \"So\r\nfar.\" It well might receive other divisions also; but this would be\r\nuseless, since it is manifest by the preceding exposition._\r\n\r\n    \"The very bitter weeping that ye made\r\n      So long a time together, eyes of mine,\r\n      Was wont to make the tears of pity shine\r\n    In other eyes full oft, as I have said.\r\n    But now this thing were scarce remember\u00e8d\r\n      If I, on my part, foully would combine\r\n      With you, and not recall each ancient sign\r\n    Of grief, and her for whom your tears were shed\r\n    It is your fickleness that doth betray\r\n      My mind to fears, and makes me tremble thus\r\n        What while a lady greets me with her eyes.\r\n    Except by death, we must not any way\r\n      Forget our lady who is gone from us.\"\r\n        So far doth my heart utter, and then sighs.\r\n\r\nThe sight of this lady brought me into so unwonted a condition that\r\nI often thought of her as of one too dear unto me; and I began to\r\nconsider her thus: \"This lady is young, beautiful, gentle, and wise;\r\nperchance it was Love himself who set her in my path, that so my\r\nlife might find peace.\" And there were times when I thought yet more\r\nfondly, until my heart consented unto its reasoning. But when it had\r\nso consented, my thought would often turn round upon me, as moved by\r\nreason, and cause me to say within myself: \"What hope is this which\r\nwould console me after so base a fashion, and which hath taken the\r\nplace of all other imagining?\" Also there was another voice within me,\r\nthat said: \"And wilt thou, having suffered so much tribulation through\r\nLove, not escape while yet thou mayst from so much bitterness? Thou\r\nmust surely know that this thought carries with it the desire of Love,\r\nand drew its life from the gentle eyes of that lady who vouchsafed\r\nthee so much pity.\" Wherefore I, having striven sorely and very often\r\nwith myself, bethought me to say somewhat thereof in rhyme. And seeing\r\nthat in the battle of doubts, the victory most often remained with such\r\nas inclined towards the lady of whom I speak, it seemed to me that I\r\nshould address this sonnet unto her: in the first line whereof, I call\r\nthat thought which spake of her a gentle thought, only because it spoke\r\nof one who was gentle; being of itself most vile.[30]\r\n\r\n  [30] Boccaccio tells us that Dante was married to Gemma Donati\r\n       about a year after the death of Beatrice. Can Gemma then be\r\n       \"the lady of the window,\" his love for whom Dante so contemns?\r\n       Such a passing conjecture (when considered together with\r\n       the interpretation of this passage in Dante's later work,\r\n       the _Convito_) would of course imply an admission of what I\r\n       believe to lie at the heart of all true Dantesque commentary;\r\n       that is, the existence always of the actual events even\r\n       where the allegorical superstructure has been raised by Dante\r\n       himself.\r\n\r\n_In this sonnet I make myself into two, according as my thoughts\r\nwere divided, one from the other. The one part I call Heart, that is,\r\nappetite; the other, Soul, that is, reason; and I tell what one saith\r\nto the other. And that it is fitting to call the appetite Heart, and\r\nthe reason Soul, is manifest enough to them to whom I wish this to be\r\nopen. True it is that, in the preceding sonnet, I take the part of\r\nthe Heart against the Eyes; and that appears contrary to what I say\r\nin the present; and therefore I say that, there also, by the Heart I\r\nmean appetite, because yet greater was my desire to remember my most\r\ngentle lady than to see this other, although indeed I had some appetite\r\ntowards her, but it appeared slight: wherefrom it appears that the one\r\nstatement is not contrary to the other. This sonnet has three parts. In\r\nthe first, I begin to say to this lady how my desires turn all towards\r\nher. In the second, I say how the Soul, that is, the reason, speaks to\r\nthe Heart, that is, to the appetite. In the third, I say how the latter\r\nanswers. The second begins here, \"And what is this?\" the third here,\r\n\"And the heart answers.\"_\r\n\r\n    A gentle thought there is will often start,\r\n      Within my secret self, to speech of thee:\r\n      Also of Love it speaks so tenderly\r\n    That much in me consents and takes its part.\r\n    \"And what is this,\" the soul saith to the heart,\r\n      \"That cometh thus to comfort thee and me,\r\n      And thence where it would dwell, thus potently\r\n    Can drive all other thoughts by its strange art?\"\r\n    And the heart answers: \"Be no more at strife\r\n      'Twixt doubt and doubt: this is Love's messenger\r\n        And speaketh but his words, from him received;\r\n    And all the strength it owns and all the life\r\n      It draweth from the gentle eyes of her\r\n        Who, looking on our grief, hath often grieved.\"\r\n\r\nBut against this adversary of reason, there rose up in me on a certain\r\nday, about the ninth hour, a strong visible phantasy, wherein I seemed\r\nto behold the most gracious Beatrice, habited in that crimson raiment\r\nwhich she had worn when I had first beheld her; also she appeared to me\r\nof the same tender age as then. Whereupon I fell into a deep thought\r\nof her: and my memory ran back, according to the order of time, unto\r\nall those matters in the which she had borne a part; and my heart began\r\npainfully to repent of the desire by which it had so basely let itself\r\nbe possessed during so many days, contrary to the constancy of reason.\r\n\r\nAnd then, this evil desire being quite gone from me, all my thoughts\r\nturned again unto their excellent Beatrice. And I say most truly that\r\nfrom that hour I thought constantly of her with the whole humbled and\r\nashamed heart; the which became often manifest in sighs, that had among\r\nthem the name of that most gracious creature, and how she departed from\r\nus. Also it would come to pass very often, through the bitter anguish\r\nof some one thought, that I forgot both it, and myself, and where\r\nI was. By this increase of sighs, my weeping, which before had been\r\nsomewhat lessened, increased in like manner; so that mine eyes seemed\r\nto long only for tears and to cherish them, and came at last to be\r\ncircled about with red as though they had suffered martyrdom: neither\r\nwere they able to look again upon the beauty of any face that might\r\nagain bring them to shame and evil: from which things it will appear\r\nthat they were fitly guerdoned for their unsteadfastness. Wherefore\r\nI, (wishing that mine abandonment of all such evil desires and vain\r\ntemptations should be certified and made manifest, beyond all doubts\r\nwhich might have been suggested by the rhymes aforewritten) proposed to\r\nwrite a sonnet wherein I should express this purport. And I then wrote,\r\n\"Woe's me!\"\r\n\r\n_I said, \"Woe's me!\" because I was ashamed of the trifling of mine\r\neyes. This sonnet I do not divide, since its purport is manifest\r\nenough._\r\n\r\n    Woe's me! by dint of all these sighs that come\r\n      Forth of my heart, its endless grief to prove,\r\n      Mine eyes are conquered, so that even to move\r\n    Their lids for greeting is grown troublesome.\r\n    They wept so long that now they are grief's home,\r\n      And count their tears all laughter far above:\r\n      They wept till they are circled now by Love\r\n    With a red circle in sign of martyrdom.\r\n    These musings, and the sighs they bring from me,\r\n      Are grown at last so constant and so sore\r\n        That love swoons in my spirit with faint breath;\r\n    Hearing in those sad sounds continually\r\n      The most sweet name that my dead lady bore,\r\n        With many grievous words touching her death.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, it happened that a great number of persons undertook a\r\npilgrimage, to the end that they might behold that blessed portraiture\r\nbequeathed unto us by our Lord Jesus Christ as the image of His\r\nbeautiful countenance,[31] (upon which countenance my dear lady now\r\nlooketh continually). And certain among these pilgrims, who seemed very\r\nthoughtful, passed by a path which is well-nigh in the midst of the\r\ncity where my most gracious lady was born, and abode, and at last died.\r\n\r\n  [31] The Veronica (_Vera icon_, or true image); that is, the napkin\r\n       with which a woman was said to have wiped our Saviour's face\r\n       on His way to the cross, and which miraculously retained its\r\n       likeness. Dante makes mention of it also in the _Commedia_\r\n       (Parad. xxi. 103), where he says:--\r\n\r\n      \"Qual \u00e8 colui che forse di Croazia\r\n        Viene a veder la Veronica nostra,\r\n      Che per l'antica fama non si sazia\r\n        Ma dice nel pensier fin che si mostra:\r\n      Signor mio Ges\u00f9 Cristo, Iddio verace,\r\n        Or fu s\u00ec fatta la sembianza vostra?\" etc.\r\n\r\nThen I, beholding them, said within myself: \"These pilgrims seem to be\r\ncome from very far; and I think they cannot have heard speak of this\r\nlady, or know anything concerning her. Their thoughts are not of her,\r\nbut of other things; it may be, of their friends who are far distant,\r\nand whom we, in our turn, know not.\" And I went on to say: \"I know that\r\nif they were of a country near unto us, they would in some wise seem\r\ndisturbed, passing through this city which is so full of grief.\" And\r\nI said also: \"If I could speak with them a space, I am certain that I\r\nshould make them weep before they went forth of this city; for those\r\nthings that they would hear from me must needs beget weeping in any.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when the last of them had gone by me, I bethought me to write a\r\nsonnet, showing forth mine inward speech; and that it might seem the\r\nmore pitiful, I made as though I had spoken it indeed unto them. And I\r\nwrote this sonnet, which beginneth: \"Ye pilgrim-folk.\" I made use of\r\nthe word _pilgrim_ for its general signification; for \"pilgrim\" may\r\nbe understood in two senses, one general, and one special. General,\r\nso far as any man may be called a pilgrim who leaveth the place of\r\nhis birth; whereas, more narrowly speaking, he only is a pilgrim who\r\ngoeth towards or frowards the House of St. James. For there are three\r\nseparate denominations proper unto those who undertake journeys to the\r\nglory of God. They are called Palmers who go beyond the seas eastward,\r\nwhence often they bring palm-branches. And Pilgrims, as I have said,\r\nare they who journey unto the holy House of Gallicia; seeing that no\r\nother apostle was buried so far from his birthplace as was the blessed\r\nSaint James. And there is a third sort who are called Romers; in that\r\nthey go whither these whom I have called pilgrims went: which is to\r\nsay, unto Rome.\r\n\r\n_This sonnet is not divided, because its own words sufficiently declare\r\nit._\r\n\r\n    Ye pilgrim-folk, advancing pensively\r\n      As if in thought of distant things, I pray,\r\n      Is your own land indeed so far away--\r\n    As by your aspect it would seem to be--\r\n    That this our heavy sorrow leaves you free\r\n      Though passing through the mournful town midway;\r\n      Like unto men that understand to-day\r\n    Nothing at all of her great misery?\r\n    Yet if ye will but stay, whom I accost,\r\n      And listen to my words a little space,\r\n        At going ye shall mourn with a loud voice.\r\n    It is her Beatrice that she hath lost;\r\n      Of whom the least word spoken holds such grace\r\n        That men weep hearing it, and have no choice.\r\n\r\nA while after these things, two gentle ladies sent unto me, praying\r\nthat I would bestow upon them certain of these my rhymes. And I (taking\r\ninto account their worthiness and consideration) resolved that I would\r\nwrite also a new thing, and send it them together with those others, to\r\nthe end that their wishes might be more honourably fulfilled. Therefore\r\nI made a sonnet, which narrates my condition, and which I caused to be\r\nconveyed to them, accompanied by the one preceding, and with that other\r\nwhich begins, \"Stay now with me and listen to my sighs.\" And the new\r\nsonnet is, \"Beyond the sphere.\"\r\n\r\n_This sonnet comprises five parts. In the first, I tell whither my\r\nthought goeth, naming the place by the name of one of its effects.\r\nIn the second, I say wherefore it goeth up, and who makes it go thus.\r\nIn the third, I tell what it saw, namely, a lady honoured. And I then\r\ncall it a \"Pilgrim Spirit,\" because it goes up spiritually, and like\r\na pilgrim who is out of his known country. In the fourth, I say how\r\nthe spirit sees her such (that is, in such quality) that I cannot\r\nunderstand her; that is to say, my thought rises into the quality\r\nof her in a degree that my intellect cannot comprehend, seeing that\r\nour intellect is, towards those blessed souls, like our eye weak\r\nagainst the sun; and this the Philosopher says in the Second of the\r\nMetaphysics. In the fifth, I say that, although I cannot see there\r\nwhither my thought carries me--that is, to her admirable essence--I at\r\nleast understand this, namely, that it is a thought of my lady, because\r\nI often hear her name therein. And, at the end of this fifth part,\r\nI say, \"Ladies mine,\" to show that they are ladies to whom I speak.\r\nThe second part begins, \"A new perception;\" the third, \"When it hath\r\nreached;\" the fourth, \"It sees her such;\" the fifth, \"And yet I know.\"\r\nIt might be divided yet more nicely, and made yet clearer; but this\r\ndivision may pass, and therefore I stay not to divide it further._\r\n\r\n    Beyond the sphere which spreads to widest space\r\n      Now soars the sigh that my heart sends above:\r\n      A new perception born of grieving Love\r\n    Guideth it upward the untrodden ways.\r\n    When it hath reached unto the end, and stays,\r\n      It sees a lady round whom splendours move\r\n      In homage; till, by the great light thereof\r\n    Abashed, the pilgrim spirit stands at gaze.\r\n    It sees her such, that when it tells me this\r\n      Which it hath seen, I understand it not,\r\n        It hath a speech so subtile and so fine.\r\n    And yet I know its voice within my thought\r\n      Often remembereth me of Beatrice:\r\n        So that I understand it, ladies mine.\r\n\r\nAfter writing this sonnet, it was given unto me to behold a very\r\nwonderful vision:[32] wherein I saw things which determined me that\r\nI would say nothing further of this most blessed one, until such time\r\nas I could discourse more worthily concerning her. And to this end I\r\nlabour all I can; as she well knoweth. Wherefore if it be His pleasure\r\nthrough whom is the life of all things, that my life continue with me\r\na few years, it is my hope that I shall yet write concerning her what\r\nhath not before been written of any woman. After the which, may it\r\nseem good unto Him who is the Master of Grace, that my spirit should go\r\nhence to behold the glory of its lady: to wit, of that blessed Beatrice\r\nwho now gazeth continually on His countenance _qui est per omnia s\u00e6cula\r\nbenedictus_.[33] _Laus Deo._\r\n\r\n  [32] This we may believe to have been the Vision of Hell,\r\n       Purgatory, and Paradise, which furnished the triple argument\r\n       of the _Divina Commedia_. The Latin words ending the _Vita\r\n       Nuova_ are almost identical with those at the close of the\r\n       letter in which Dante, on concluding the _Paradise_, and\r\n       accomplishing the hope here expressed, dedicates his great\r\n       work to Can Grande della Scala.\r\n\r\n  [33] \"Who is blessed throughout all ages.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE SIDDAL EDITION\r\n                                   OF\r\n                        D.

Beatrice Pearse\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Queen came in most splendidly dressed p. 27]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAGIC FISHBONE\r\n\r\nA Holiday Romance\r\nfrom the Pen of\r\nMiss Alice Rainbird\r\nAged 7.\r\n\r\nby\r\n\r\nCHARLES DICKENS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon: Constable and Co. Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story contained herein was written by Charles Dickens in 1867. It is\r\nthe second of four stories entitled \"Holiday Romance\" and was published\r\noriginally in a children's magazine in America. It purports to be written\r\nby a child aged seven. It was republished in England in \"All the Year\r\nRound\" in 1868. For this and four other Christmas pieces Dickens received\r\n\u00a31,000.\r\n\r\n\"Holiday Romance\" was published in book form by Messrs Chapman & Hall in\r\n1874, with \"Edwin Drood\" and other stories.\r\n\r\nFor this reprint the text of the story as it appeared in \"All the Year\r\nRound\" has been followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEVERAL OF THE CHILDREN WERE GROWING OUT OF THEIR CLOTHES]\r\n\r\nThere was once a King, and he had a Queen; and he was the manliest of\r\nhis sex, and she was the loveliest of hers. The King was, in his private\r\nprofession, Under Government. The Queen's father had been a medical man\r\nout of town.\r\n\r\nThey had nineteen children, and were always having more. Seventeen of\r\nthese children took care of the baby; and Alicia, the eldest, took care\r\nof them all. Their ages varied from seven years to seven months.\r\n\r\nLet us now resume our story.\r\n\r\nOne day the King was going to the office, when he stopped at the\r\nfishmonger's to buy a pound and a half of salmon not too near the tail,\r\nwhich the Queen (who was a careful housekeeper) had requested him to send\r\nhome. Mr Pickles, the fishmonger, said, \"Certainly, sir, is there any\r\nother article, Good-morning.\"\r\n\r\nThe King went on towards the office in a melancholy mood, for quarter day\r\nwas such a long way off, and several of the dear children were growing out\r\nof their clothes. He had not proceeded far, when Mr Pickles's errand-boy\r\ncame running after him, and said, \"Sir, you didn't notice the old lady in\r\nour shop.\"\r\n\r\n\"What old lady?\" enquired the King. \"I saw none.\"\r\n\r\nNow, the King had not seen any old lady, because this old lady had been\r\ninvisible to him, though visible to Mr Pickles's boy. Probably because he\r\nmessed and splashed the water about to that degree, and flopped the pairs\r\nof soles down in that violent manner, that, if she had not been visible to\r\nhim, he would have spoilt her clothes.\r\n\r\nJust then the old lady came trotting up. She was dressed in shot-silk of\r\nthe richest quality, smelling of dried lavender.\r\n\r\n\"King Watkins the First, I believe?\" said the old lady.\r\n\r\n\"Watkins,\" replied the King, \"is my name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Papa, if I am not mistaken, of the beautiful Princess Alicia?\" said the\r\nold lady.\r\n\r\n\"And of eighteen other darlings,\" replied the King.\r\n\r\n\"Listen. You are going to the office,\" said the old lady.\r\n\r\nIt instantly flashed upon the King that she must be a Fairy, or how could\r\nshe know that?\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said the old lady, answering his thoughts, \"I am the Good\r\nFairy Grandmarina. Attend. When you return home to dinner, politely invite\r\nthe Princess Alicia to have some of the salmon you bought just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may disagree with her,\" said the King.\r\n\r\nThe old lady became so very angry at this absurd idea, that the King was\r\nquite alarmed, and humbly begged her pardon.\r\n\r\n\"We hear a great deal too much about this thing disagreeing, and that\r\nthing disagreeing,\" said the old lady, with the greatest contempt it was\r\npossible to express. \"Don't be greedy. I think you want it all yourself.\"\r\n\r\nThe King hung his head under this reproof, and said he wouldn't talk about\r\nthings disagreeing, any more.\r\n\r\n\"Be good, then,\" said the Fairy Grandmarina, \"and don't! When the\r\nbeautiful Princess Alicia consents to partake of the salmon--as I think\r\nshe will--you will find she will leave a fish-bone on her plate. Tell\r\nher to dry it, and to rub it, and to polish it till it shines like\r\nmother-of-pearl, and to take care of it as a present from me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" asked the King.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be impatient, sir,\" returned the Fairy Grandmarina, scolding him\r\nseverely. \"Don't catch people short, before they have done speaking. Just\r\nthe way with you grown-up persons. You are always doing it.\"\r\n\r\nThe King again hung his head, and said he wouldn't do so any more.\r\n\r\n\"Be good then,\" said the Fairy Grandmarina, \"and don't! Tell the Princess\r\nAlicia, with my love, that the fish-bone is a magic present which can only\r\nbe used once; but that it will bring her, that once, whatever she wishes\r\nfor, PROVIDED SHE WISHES FOR IT AT THE RIGHT TIME. That is the\r\nmessage. Take care of it.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOITY TOITY ME!]\r\n\r\nThe King was beginning, \"Might I ask the reason--?\" when the Fairy became\r\nabsolutely furious.\r\n\r\n\"_Will_ you be good, sir?\" she exclaimed, stamping her foot on the ground.\r\n\"The reason for this, and the reason for that, indeed! You are always\r\nwanting the reason. No reason. There! Hoity toity me! I am sick of your\r\ngrown-up reasons.\"\r\n\r\nThe King was extremely frightened by the old lady's flying into such a\r\npassion, and said he was very sorry to have offended her, and he wouldn't\r\nask for reasons any more.\r\n\r\n\"Be good then,\" said the old lady, \"and don't!\"\r\n\r\nWith those words, Grandmarina vanished, and the King went on and on and\r\non, till he came to the office. There he wrote and wrote and wrote, till\r\nit was time to go home again. Then he politely invited the Princess\r\nAlicia, as the Fairy had directed him, to partake of the salmon. And\r\nwhen she had enjoyed it very much, he saw the fish-bone on her plate, as\r\nthe Fairy had told him he would, and he delivered the Fairy's message, and\r\nthe Princess Alicia took care to dry the bone, and to rub it, and to\r\npolish it till it shone like mother-of-pearl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He saw the Fish-bone on her Plate]\r\n\r\nAnd so when the Queen was going to get up in the morning, she said, \"O,\r\ndear me, dear me; my head, my head!\" and then she fainted away.\r\n\r\nThe Princess Alicia, who happened to be looking in at the chamber-door,\r\nasking about breakfast, was very much alarmed when she saw her Royal Mamma\r\nin this state, and she rang the bell for Peggy, which was the name of the\r\nLord Chamberlain. But remembering where the smelling-bottle was, she\r\nclimbed on a chair and got it, and after that she climbed on another chair\r\nby the bedside and held the smelling-bottle to the Queen's nose, and after\r\nthat she jumped down and got some water, and after that she jumped up\r\nagain and wetted the Queen's forehead, and, in short, when the Lord\r\nChamberlain came in, that dear old woman said to the little Princess,\r\n\"What a Trot you are! I couldn't have done it better myself!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut that was not the worst of the good Queen's illness. O, no! She was\r\nvery ill indeed, for a long time. The Princess Alicia kept the seventeen\r\nyoung Princes and Princesses quiet, and dressed and undressed and danced\r\nthe baby, and made the kettle boil, and heated the soup, and swept the\r\nhearth, and poured out the medicine, and nursed the Queen, and did all\r\nthat ever she could, and was as busy busy busy, as busy could be. For\r\nthere were not many servants at that Palace, for three reasons; because\r\nthe King was short of money, because a rise in his office never seemed to\r\ncome, and because quarter day was so far off that it looked almost as far\r\noff and as little as one of the stars.\r\n\r\nBut on the morning when the Queen fainted away, where was the magic\r\nfish-bone? Why, there it was in the Princess Alicia's pocket. She had\r\nalmost taken it out to bring the Queen to life again, when she put it\r\nback, and looked for the smelling-bottle.\r\n\r\nAfter the Queen had come out of her swoon that morning, and was dozing,\r\nthe Princess Alicia hurried up-stairs to tell a most particular secret to\r\na most particularly confidential friend of hers, who was a Duchess. People\r\ndid suppose her to be a Doll; but she was really a Duchess, though nobody\r\nknew it except the Princess.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis most particular secret was a secret about the magic fish-bone, the\r\nhistory of which was well known to the Duchess, because the Princess told\r\nher everything. The Princess kneeled down by the bed on which the Duchess\r\nwas lying, full-dressed and wide awake, and whispered the secret to her.\r\nThe Duchess smiled and nodded. People might have supposed that she never\r\nsmiled and nodded, but she often did, though nobody knew it except the\r\nPrincess.\r\n\r\nThen the Princess Alicia hurried downstairs again, to keep watch in the\r\nQueen's room. She often kept watch by herself in the Queen's room; but\r\nevery evening, while the illness lasted, she sat there watching with the\r\nKing. And every evening the King sat looking at her with a cross look,\r\nwondering why she never brought out the magic fish-bone. As often as she\r\nnoticed this, she ran up-stairs, whispered the secret to the Duchess over\r\nagain, and said to the Duchess besides, \"They think we children never have\r\na reason or a meaning!\" And the Duchess, though the most fashionable\r\nDuchess that ever was heard of, winked her eye.\r\n\r\n\"Alicia,\" said the King, one evening when she wished him Good Night.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is become of the magic fish-bone?\"\r\n\r\n\"In my pocket, Papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you had lost it?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, no, Papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or forgotten it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed, Papa.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so another time the dreadful little snapping pug-dog next door made a\r\nrush at one of the young Princes as he stood on the steps coming home from\r\nschool, and terrified him out of his wits and he put his hand through a\r\npane of glass, and bled bled bled. When the seventeen other young Princes\r\nand Princesses saw him bleed bleed bleed, they were terrified out of their\r\nwits too, and screamed themselves black in their seventeen faces all at\r\nonce. But the Princess Alicia put her hands over all their seventeen\r\nmouths, one after another, and persuaded them to be quiet because of the\r\nsick Queen. And then she put the wounded Prince's hand in a basin of fresh\r\ncold water, while they stared with their twice seventeen are thirty-four\r\nput down four and carry three eyes, and then she looked in the hand for\r\nbits of glass, and there were fortunately no bits of glass there. And\r\nthen she said to two chubby-legged Princes who were sturdy though small,\r\n\"Bring me in the Royal rag-bag; I must snip and stitch and cut and\r\ncontrive.\" So those two young Princes tugged at the Royal rag-bag and\r\nlugged it in, and the Princess Alicia sat down on the floor with a large\r\npair of scissors and a needle and thread, and snipped and stitched and\r\ncut and contrived, and made a bandage and put it on, and it fitted\r\nbeautifully, and so when it was all done she saw the King her Papa\r\nlooking on by the door.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Alicia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you been doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Snipping stitching cutting and contriving, Papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is the magic fish-bone?\"\r\n\r\n\"In my pocket, Papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you had lost it?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, no, Papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or forgotten it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed, Papa.\"\r\n\r\nAfter that, she ran up-stairs to the Duchess and told her what had passed,\r\nand told her the secret over again, and the Duchess shook her flaxen curls\r\nand laughed with her rosy lips.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWell! and so another time the baby fell under the grate. The seventeen\r\nyoung Princes and Princesses were used to it, for they were almost always\r\nfalling under the grate or down the stairs, but the baby was not used to\r\nit yet, and it gave him a swelled face and a black eye. The way the poor\r\nlittle darling came to tumble was, that he slid out of the Princess\r\nAlicia's lap just as she was sitting in a great coarse apron that quite\r\nsmothered her, in front of the kitchen-fire, beginning to peel the turnips\r\nfor the broth for dinner; and the way she came to be doing that was, that\r\nthe King's cook had run away that morning with her own true love who was a\r\nvery tall but very tipsy soldier. Then, the seventeen young Princes and\r\nPrincesses, who cried at everything that happened, cried and roared. But\r\nthe Princess Alicia (who couldn't help crying a little herself) quietly\r\ncalled to them to be still, on account of not throwing back the Queen\r\nup-stairs, who was fast getting well, and said, \"Hold your tongues, you\r\nwicked little monkeys, every one of you, while I examine baby!\" Then she\r\nexamined baby, and found that he hadn't broken anything, and she held\r\ncold iron to his poor dear eye, and smoothed his poor dear face, and he\r\npresently fell asleep in her arms. Then, she said to the seventeen Princes\r\nand Princesses, \"I am afraid to lay him down yet, lest he should wake and\r\nfeel pain, be good, and you shall all be cooks.\" They jumped for joy when\r\nthey heard that, and began making themselves cooks' caps out of old\r\nnewspapers. So to one she gave the salt-box, and to one she gave the\r\nbarley, and to one she gave the herbs, and to one she gave the turnips,\r\nand to one she gave the carrots, and to one she gave the onions, and to\r\none she gave the spice-box, till they were all cooks, and all running\r\nabout at work, she sitting in the middle smothered in the great coarse\r\napron, nursing baby. By and by the broth was done, and the baby woke up\r\nsmiling like an angel, and was trusted to the sedatest Princess to hold,\r\nwhile the other Princes and Princesses were squeezed into a far-off corner\r\nto look at the Princess Alicia turning out the saucepan-full of broth,\r\nfor fear (as they were always getting into trouble) they should get\r\nsplashed and scalded. When the broth came tumbling out, steaming\r\nbeautifully, and smelling like a nosegay good to eat, they clapped their\r\nhands. That made the baby clap his hands; and that, and his looking as if\r\nhe had a comic toothache, made all the Princes and Princesses laugh. So\r\nthe Princess Alicia said, \"Laugh and be good, and after dinner we will\r\nmake him a nest on the floor in a corner, and he shall sit in his nest\r\nand see a dance of eighteen cooks.\" That delighted the young Princes and\r\nPrincesses, and they ate up all the broth, and washed up all the plates\r\nand dishes, and cleared away, and pushed the table into a corner, and\r\nthen they in their cooks' caps, and the Princess Alicia in the smothering\r\ncoarse apron that belonged to the cook that had run away with her own true\r\nlove that was the very tall but very tipsy soldier, danced a dance of\r\neighteen cooks before the angelic baby, who forgot his swelled face and\r\nhis black eye, and crowed with joy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Dance of the Eighteen Cooks]\r\n\r\nAnd so then, once more the Princess Alicia saw King Watkins the First,\r\nher father, standing in the doorway looking on, and he said: \"What have\r\nyou been doing, Alicia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cooking and contriving, Papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"What else have you been doing, Alicia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Keeping the children light-hearted, Papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is the magic fish-bone, Alicia?\"\r\n\r\n\"In my pocket, Papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you had lost it?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, no, Papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or forgotten it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed, Papa.\"\r\n\r\nThe King then sighed so heavily, and seemed so low-spirited, and sat down\r\nso miserably, leaning his head upon his hand, and his elbow upon the\r\nkitchen table pushed away in the corner, that the seventeen Princes and\r\nPrincesses crept softly out of the kitchen, and left him alone with the\r\nPrincess Alicia and the angelic baby.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, Papa?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am dreadfully poor, my child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you no money at all, Papa?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"What is the matter, Papa?\"]\r\n\r\n\"None my child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there no way left of getting any, Papa?\"\r\n\r\n\"No way,\" said the King. \"I have tried very hard, and I have tried all\r\nways.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she heard those last words, the Princess Alicia began to put her hand\r\ninto the pocket where she kept the magic fish-bone.\r\n\r\n\"Papa,\" said she, \"when we have tried very hard, and tried all ways, we\r\nmust have done our very very best?\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt, Alicia.\"\r\n\r\n\"When we have done our very very best, Papa, and that is not enough, then\r\nI think the right time must have come for asking help of others.\" This was\r\nthe very secret connected with the magic fish-bone, which she had found\r\nout for herself from the good fairy Grandmarina's words, and which she had\r\nso often whispered to her beautiful and fashionable friend the Duchess.\r\n\r\nSo she took out of her pocket the magic fish-bone that had been dried and\r\nrubbed and polished till it shone like mother-of-pearl; and she gave it\r\none little kiss and wished it was quarter day. And immediately it _was_\r\nquarter day; and the King's quarter's salary came rattling down the\r\nchimney, and bounced into the middle of the floor.\r\n\r\nBut this was not half of what happened, no not a quarter, for immediately\r\nafterwards the good fairy Grandmarina came riding in, in a carriage and\r\nfour (Peacocks), with Mr Pickles's boy up behind, dressed in silver and\r\ngold, with a cocked hat, powdered hair, pink silk stockings, a jewelled\r\ncane, and a nosegay. Down jumped Mr Pickles's boy with his cocked hat in\r\nhis hand and wonderfully polite (being entirely changed by enchantment),\r\nand handed Grandmarina out, and there she stood in her rich shot silk\r\nsmelling of dried lavender, fanning herself with a sparkling fan.\r\n\r\n\"Alicia, my dear,\" said this charming old Fairy, \"how do you do, I hope I\r\nsee you pretty well, give me a kiss.\"\r\n\r\nThe Princess Alicia embraced her, and then Grandmarina turned to the King,\r\nand said rather sharply:--\"Are you good?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Alicia, my dear ... how do you do?\"]\r\n\r\nThe King said he hoped so.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you know the reason, _now_, why my god-Daughter here,\" kissing\r\nthe Princess again, \"did not apply to the fish-bone sooner?\" said the\r\nFairy.\r\n\r\nThe King made her a shy bow.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! but you didn't _then_!\" said the Fairy.\r\n\r\nThe King made her a shyer bow.\r\n\r\n\"Any more reasons to ask for?\" said the Fairy.\r\n\r\nThe King said no, and he was very sorry.\r\n\r\n\"Be good then,\" said the Fairy, \"and live happy ever afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nThen, Grandmarina waved her fan, and the Queen came in most splendidly\r\ndressed, and the seventeen young Princes and Princesses, no longer grown\r\nout of their clothes, came in newly fitted out from top to toe, with tucks\r\nin everything to admit of its being let out. After that, the Fairy tapped\r\nthe Princess Alicia with her fan, and the smothering coarse apron flew\r\naway, and she appeared exquisitely dressed, like a little Bride, with\r\na wreath of orange-flowers and a silver veil. After that, the kitchen\r\ndresser changed of itself into a wardrobe, made of beautiful woods and\r\ngold and looking glass, which was full of dresses of all sorts, all for\r\nher and all exactly fitting her. After that, the angelic baby came in,\r\nrunning alone, with his face and eye not a bit the worse but much the\r\nbetter. Then, Grandmarina begged to be introduced to the Duchess, and,\r\nwhen the Duchess was brought down many compliments passed between them.\r\n\r\nA little whispering took place between the Fairy and the Duchess, and\r\nthen the Fairy said out loud, \"Yes. I thought she would have told you.\"\r\nGrandmarina then turned to the King and Queen, and said, \"We are going\r\nin search of Prince Certainpersonio. The pleasure of your company is\r\nrequested at church in half an hour precisely.\" So she and the Princess\r\nAlicia got into the carriage, and Mr Pickles's boy handed in the Duchess\r\nwho sat by herself on the opposite seat, and then Mr Pickles's boy put up\r\nthe steps and got up behind, and the Peacocks flew away with their tails\r\nspread.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: She appeared exquisitely dressed, like a little Bride]\r\n\r\nPrince Certainpersonio was sitting by himself, eating barley-sugar\r\nand waiting to be ninety. When he saw the Peacocks followed by the\r\ncarriage, coming in at the window, it immediately occurred to him that\r\nsomething uncommon was going to happen.\r\n\r\n\"Prince,\" said Grandmarina, \"I bring you your Bride.\"\r\n\r\nThe moment the Fairy said those words, Prince Certainpersonio's face left\r\noff being stickey, and his jacket and corduroys changed to peach-bloom\r\nvelvet, and his hair curled, and a cap and feather flew in like a bird and\r\nsettled on his head. He got into the carriage by the Fairy's invitation,\r\nand there he renewed his acquaintance with the Duchess, whom he had seen\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nIn the church were the Prince's relations and friends, and the Princess\r\nAlicia's relations and friends, and the seventeen Princes and Princesses,\r\nand the baby, and a crowd of the neighbours. The marriage was beautiful\r\nbeyond expression. The Duchess was bridesmaid, and beheld the ceremony\r\nfrom the pulpit where she was supported by the cushion of the desk.\r\n\r\nGrandmarina gave a magnificent wedding feast afterwards, in which there\r\nwas everything and more to eat, and everything and more to drink. The\r\nwedding cake was delicately ornamented with white satin ribbons, frosted\r\nsilver and white lilies, and was forty-two yards round.\r\n\r\nWhen Grandmarina had drunk her love to the young couple, and Prince\r\nCertainpersonio had made a speech, and everybody had cried Hip hip hip\r\nhurrah! Grandmarina announced to the King and Queen that in future there\r\nwould be eight quarter days in every year, except in leap year, when there\r\nwould be ten. She then turned to Certainpersonio and Alicia, and said, \"My\r\ndears, you will have thirty-five children, and they will all be good and\r\nbeautiful. Seventeen of your children will be boys, and eighteen will be\r\ngirls. The hair of the whole of your children will curl naturally. They\r\nwill never have the measles, and will have recovered from the\r\nwhooping-cough before being born.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing such good news, everybody cried out \"Hip hip hip hurrah!\"\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"It only remains,\" said Grandmarina in conclusion, \"to make an end of the\r\nfish-bone.\"\r\n\r\nSo she took it from the hand of the Princess Alicia, and it instantly flew\r\ndown the throat of the dreadful little snapping pug-dog next door and\r\nchoked him, and he expired in convulsions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n                *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTED AT THE ARDEN PRESS, LETCHWORTH, ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nFIRST IMPRESSION, TWELVE THOUSAND COPIES, SEPT.

His mother, at any rate, was a Frenchwoman, whom his\r\nfather seduced during a sojourn at Paris, and afterwards deserted. So much\r\nas this Boccaccio has himself told us, under a transparent veil of allegory,\r\nin his Ameto. Of his mother we would fain know more, for his wit has in it\r\na quality, especially noticeable in the Tenth Novel of the Sixth Day of the\r\nDecameron, which marks him out as the forerunner of Rabelais, and prompts us\r\nto ask how much more his genius may have owed to his French ancestry. His\r\nfather was of sufficient standing in Florence to be chosen Prior in 1321;\r\nbut this brief term of office--but two months--was his last, as well as his\r\nfirst experience of public life. Of Boccaccio's early years we know nothing\r\nmore than that his first preceptor was the Florentine grammarian, Giovanni\r\nda Strada, father of the poet Zanobi da Strada, and that, when he was about\r\nten years old, he was bound apprentice to a merchant, with whom he spent\r\nthe next six years at Paris, whence he returned to Florence with an\r\ninveterate repugnance to commerce. His father then proposed to make a\r\ncanonist of him; but the study of Gratian proved hardly more congenial than\r\nthe routine of the counting-house to the lad, who had already evinced a\r\ntaste for letters; and a sojourn at Naples, where under the regime of the\r\nenlightened King Robert there were coteries of learned men, and even Greek\r\nwas not altogether unknown, decided his future career. According to Filippo\r\nVillani his choice was finally fixed by a visit to the tomb of Vergil on the\r\nVia Puteolana, and, though the modern critical spirit is apt to discount such\r\nstories, there can be no doubt that such a pilgrimage would be apt to make a\r\ndeep, and perhaps enduring, impression upon a nature ardent and sensitive,\r\nand already conscious of extraordinary powers. His stay at Naples was also in\r\nanother respect a turning point in his life; for it was there that, as we\r\ngather from the Filocopo, he first saw the blonde beauty, Maria, natural\r\ndaughter of King Robert, whom he has immortalized as Fiammetta. The place was\r\nthe church of San Lorenzo, the day the 26th of March, 1334. Boccaccio's\r\nadmiring gaze was observed by the lady, who, though married, proved no Laura,\r\nand forthwith returned his love in equal measure. Their liaison lasted several\r\nyears, during which Boccaccio recorded the various phases of their passion\r\nwith exemplary assiduity in verse and prose. Besides paying her due and\r\ndiscreet homage in sonnet and canzone, he associated her in one way or another,\r\nnot only with the Filocopo (his prose romance of Florio and Biancofiore, which\r\nhe professes to have written to pleasure her), but with the Ameto, the Amorosa\r\nVisione, the Teseide, and the Filostrato; and in L'Amorosa Fiammetta he wove\r\nout of their relations a romance in which her lover, who is there called\r\nPamfilo, plays Aeneas to her Dido, though with somewhat less tragic\r\nconsequences. The Proem to the Decameron shews us the after-glow of his\r\npassion; the lady herself appears as one of the \"honourable company,\" and\r\nher portrait, as in the act of receiving the laurel wreath at the close of\r\nthe Fourth Day, is a masterpiece of tender and delicate delineation.\r\n\r\nBoccaccio appears to have been recalled to Florence by his father in 1341;\r\nand it was probably in that year that he wrote L'Amorosa Fiammetta and the\r\nallegorical prose pastoral (with songs interspersed) which he entitled\r\nAmeto, and in which Fiammetta masquerades in green as one of the nymphs.\r\nThe Amorosa Visione, written about the same time, is not only an allegory but\r\nan acrostic, the initial letters of its fifteen hundred triplets composing two\r\nsonnets and a ballade in honour of Fiammetta, whom he here for once ventures\r\nto call by her true name. Later came the Teseide, or romance of Palamon and\r\nArcite, the first extant rendering of the story, in twelve books, and the\r\nFilostrato, nine books of the loves and woes of Troilus and Cressida. Both\r\nthese poems are in ottava rima, a metre which, if Boccaccio did not invent\r\nit, he was the first to apply to such a purpose. Both works were dedicated\r\nto Fiammetta. A graceful idyll in the same metre, Ninfale Fiesolano, was\r\nwritten later, probably at Naples in 1345. King Robert was then dead, but\r\nBoccaccio enjoyed the favour of Queen Joan, of somewhat doubtful memory, at\r\nwhose instance he hints in one of his later letters that he wrote the\r\nDecameron. Without impugning Boccaccio's veracity we can hardly but think\r\nthat the Decameron would have seen the light, though Queen Joan had withheld\r\nher encouragement. He had probably been long meditating it, and gathering\r\nmaterials for it, and we may well suppose that the outbreak of the plague in\r\n1348, by furnishing him with a sombre background to heighten the effect of\r\nhis motley pageant, had far more to do with accelerating the composition\r\nthan aught that Queen Joan may have said.\r\n\r\nThat Boccaccio was not at Florence during the pestilence is certain; but we\r\nneed not therefore doubt the substantial accuracy of his marvellous\r\ndescription of the state of the stricken city, for the course and\r\nconsequences of the terrible visitation must have been much the same in all\r\nparts of Italy, and as to Florence in particular, Boccaccio could have no\r\ndifficulty in obtaining detailed and abundant information from credible\r\neye-witnesses. The introduction of Fiammetta, who was in all probability at\r\nNaples at the time, and in any case was not a Florentine, shews, however,\r\nthat he is by no means to be taken literally, and renders it extremely\r\nprobable that the facetious, irrepressible, and privileged Dioneo is no\r\nother than himself. At the same time we cannot deem it either impossible,\r\nor very unlikely, that in the general relaxation of morale, which the plague\r\nbrought in its train, refuge from care and fear was sought in the diversions\r\nwhich he describes by some of those who had country-seats to which to\r\nwithdraw, and whether the \"contado\" was that of Florence or that of Naples\r\nis a matter of no considerable importance. (1) It is probable that\r\nBoccaccio's father was one of the victims of the pestilence; for he was dead\r\nin 1350, when his son returned to Florence to live thenceforth on the modest\r\npatrimony which he inherited. It must have been about this time that he\r\nformed an intimacy with Petrarch, which, notwithstanding marked diversity\r\nof temperament, character and pursuits, was destined to be broken only by\r\ndeath. Despite his complaints of the malevolence of his critics in the Proem\r\nto the Fourth Day of the Decameron, he had no lack of appreciation on the\r\npart of his fellow-citizens, and was employed by the Republic on several\r\nmissions; to Bologna, probably with the view of averting the submission of\r\nthat city to the Visconti in 1350; to Petrarch at Padua in March 1351, with\r\na letter from the Priors announcing his restitution to citizenship, and\r\ninviting him to return to Florence, and assume the rectorship of the newly\r\nfounded university; to Ludwig of Brandenburg with overtures for an alliance\r\nagainst the Visconti in December of the same year; and in the spring of 1354\r\nto Pope Innocent VI. at Avignon in reference to the approaching visit of the\r\nEmperor Charles IV. to Italy. About this time, 1354-5, he threw off, in\r\nstriking contrast to his earlier works, an invective against women, entitled\r\nLaberinto d'Amore, otherwise Corbaccio, a coarse performance occasioned by\r\nresentment at what he deemed capricious treatment by a lady to whom he had\r\nmade advances. To the same period, though the date cannot be precisely fixed,\r\nbelongs his Life of Dante, a work of but mediocre merit. Somewhat later, it\r\nwould seem, he began the study of Greek under one Leontius Pilatus, a\r\nCalabrian, who possessed some knowledge of that language, and sought to pass\r\nhimself off as a Greek by birth.\r\n\r\nLeontius was of coarse manners and uncertain temper, but Boccaccio was his\r\nhost and pupil for some years, and eventually procured him the chair of\r\nGreek in the university of Florence. How much Greek Boccaccio learned from\r\nhim, and how far he may have been beholden to him in the compilation of\r\nhis elaborate Latin treatise De Genealogia Deorum, in which he essayed with\r\nvery curious results to expound the inner meaning of mythology, it is\r\nimpossible to say. In 1361 he seems to have had serious thoughts of\r\ndevoting himself to religion, being prodigiously impressed by the menaces,\r\nmonitions and revelations of a dying Carthusian of Siena. One of the\r\nrevelations concerned a matter which Boccaccio had supposed to be known only\r\nto Petrarch and himself. He accordingly confided his anxiety to Petrarch,\r\nwho persuaded him to amend his life without renouncing the world. In 1362\r\nhe revisited Naples, and in the following year spent three months with\r\nPetrarch at Venice. In 1365 he was sent by the Republic of Florence on a\r\nmission of conciliation to Pope Urban V. at Avignon. He was employed on a\r\nlike errand on the Pope's return to Rome in 1367. In 1368 he revisited\r\nVenice, and in 1371 Naples; but in May 1372 he returned to Florence, where\r\non 25th August 1373 he was appointed lecturer on the Divina Commedia, with\r\na yearly stipend of 100 fiorini d'oro. His lectures, of which the first\r\nwas delivered in the church of San Stefano near the Ponte Vecchio, were\r\ndiscontinued owing to ill health, doubtless aggravated by the distress which\r\nthe death of Petrarch (20th July 1374) could not but cause him, when he had\r\ngot no farther than the seventeenth Canto of the Inferno. His commentary is\r\nstill occasionally quoted. He died, perhaps in the odour of sanctity, for\r\nin later life he was a diligent collector of relics, at Certaldo on 21st\r\nDecember 1375, and was buried in the parish church. His tomb was desecrated,\r\nand his remains were dispersed, owing, it is said, to a misunderstanding,\r\ntowards the close of the eighteenth century. His library, which by his\r\ndirection was placed in the Convent of Santo Spirito at Florence, was\r\ndestroyed by fire about a century after his death.\r\n\r\nBesides the De Genealogia Deorum Boccaccio wrote other treatises in Latin,\r\nwhich need not here be specified, and sixteen Eclogues in the same language,\r\nof which he was by no means a master. As for his minor works in the\r\nvernacular, the earlier of them shew that he had not as yet wrought himself\r\nfree from the conventionalism which the polite literature of Italy inherited\r\nfrom the Sicilians. It is therefore inevitable that the twentieth century\r\nshould find the Filocopo, Ameto, and Amorosa Visione tedious reading. The\r\nTeseide determined the form in which Pulci, Boiardo, Bello, Ariosto, Tasso,\r\nand, with a slight modification, our own Spenser were to write, but its\r\nreaders are now few, and are not likely ever again to be numerous. Chaucer\r\ndrew upon it for the Knight's Tale, but it is at any rate arguable that his\r\nretrenchment of its perhaps inordinate length was judicious, and that what\r\nhe gave was better than what he borrowed. Still, that it had such a redactor\r\nas Chaucer is no small testimony to its merit; nor was it only in the\r\nKnight's Tale that he was indebted to it: the description of the Temple of\r\nLove in the Parlement of Foules is taken almost word for word from it. Even\r\nmore considerable and conspicuous is Chaucer's obligation to Boccaccio in\r\nthe Troilus and Criseyde, about a third of which is borrowed from the\r\nFilostrato. Nor is it a little remarkable that the same man, that in the\r\nTeseide and Filostrato founded the chivalrous epic, should also and in the\r\nsame period of his literary activity, have written the first and not the\r\nleast powerful and artistic of psychologic romances, for even such is\r\nL'Amorosa Fiammetta.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be the final verdict of criticism upon these minor works of\r\nBoccaccio, it is impossible to imagine an age in which the Decameron will\r\nfail of general recognition as, in point alike of invention as of style, one\r\nof the most notable creations of human genius. Of few books are the sources\r\nso recondite, insomuch that it seems to be certain that in the main they\r\nmust have be merely oral tradition, and few have exercised so wide and\r\nmighty an influence. The profound, many-sided and intimate knowledge of\r\nhuman nature which it evinces, its vast variety of incident, its wealth\r\nof tears and laughter, its copious and felicitous diction, inevitably apt\r\nfor every occasion, and, notwithstanding the frequent harshness, and\r\noccasional obscurity of its at times tangled, at times laboured periods,\r\nits sustained energy and animation of style must ever ensure for this human\r\ncomedy unchallenged rank among the literary masterpieces that are truly\r\nimmortal.\r\n\r\nThe Decameron was among the earliest of printed books, Venice leading the\r\nway with a folio edition in 1471, Mantua following suit in 1472, and\r\nVicenza in 1478. A folio edition, adorned, with most graceful wood-\r\nengravings, was published at Venice in 1492. Notwithstanding the freedom\r\nwith which in divers passages Boccaccio reflected on the morals of the\r\nclergy, the Roman Curia spared the book, which the austere Savonarola\r\ncondemned to the flames. The tradition that the Decameron was among the\r\npile of \"vanities\" burned by Savonarola in the Piazza della Signoria on\r\nthe last day of the Carnival of 1497, little more than a year before he\r\nwas himself burned there, is so intrinsically probable--and accords so\r\nwell with the extreme paucity of early copies of the work--that it would\r\nbe the very perversity of scepticism to doubt it. It is by no means to\r\nthe credit of our country that, except to scholars, it long remained in\r\nEngland, an almost entirely closed book. (2) Indeed the first nominally\r\ncomplete English translation, a sadly mutilated and garbled rendering of\r\nthe French version by Antoine Le Macon, did not appear till 1620, and\r\nthough successive redactions brought it nearer to the original, it\r\nremained at the best but a sorry faute de mieux. Such as it was,\r\nhowever, our forefathers were perforce fain to be content with it.\r\n\r\nThe first Englishman to render the whole Decameron direct from the Italian\r\nwas Mr. John Payne; but his work, printed for the Villon Society in 1886,\r\nwas only for private circulation, and those least inclined to disparage\r\nits merits may deem its style somewhat too archaic and stilted adequately\r\nto render the vigour and vivacity of the original. Accordingly in the\r\npresent version an attempt has been made to hit the mean between archaism\r\nand modernism, and to secure as much freedom and spirit as is compatible\r\nwith substantial accuracy.\r\n\r\n(1) As to the palaces in which the scene is laid, Manni (Istoria del\r\nDecamerone, Par. ii. cap. ii.) identifies the first with a villa near\r\nFiesole, which can be no other than the Villa Palmieri, and the second (ib.\r\ncap. lxxvi.) with the Podere della Fonte, or so-called Villa del Boccaccio,\r\nnear Camerata. Baldelli's theory, adopted by Mrs. Janet Ann Ross (Florentine\r\nVillas, 1901), that the Villa di Poggio Gherardi was the first, and the\r\nVilla Palmieri the second, retreat is not to be reconciled with Boccaccio's\r\ndescriptions. The Villa Palmieri is not remote enough for the second and\r\nmore sequestered retreat, nor is it, as that is said to have been, situate\r\non a low hill amid a plain, but on the lower Fiesolean slope. The most\r\nrational supposition would seem to be that Boccaccio, who had seen many a\r\nluxurious villa, freely combined his experiences in the description of his\r\npalaces and pleasaunces, and never expected to be taken au pied de la\r\nlettre.\r\n\r\n(2) Nevertheless Shakespeare derived indirectly the plot of All's Well that\r\nEnds Well from the Ninth Novel of the Third Day, and an element in the plot\r\nof Cymbeline from the Ninth Novel of the Second Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nBeginneth here the book called Decameron, otherwise Prince Galeotto, wherein\r\nare contained one hundred novels told in ten days by seven ladies and three\r\nyoung men.\r\n--\r\n\r\nPROEM\r\n\r\n'Tis humane to have compassion on the afflicted and as it shews well in all,\r\nso it is especially demanded of those who have had need of comfort and have\r\nfound it in others: among whom, if any had ever need thereof or found it\r\nprecious or delectable, I may be numbered; seeing that from my early youth\r\neven to the present I was beyond measure aflame with a most aspiring and\r\nnoble love (1) more perhaps than, were I to enlarge upon it, would seem to\r\naccord with my lowly condition. Whereby, among people of discernment to\r\nwhose knowledge it had come, I had much praise and high esteem, but\r\nnevertheless extreme discomfort and suffering not indeed by reason of\r\ncruelty on the part of the beloved lady, but through superabundant ardour\r\nengendered in the soul by ill-bridled desire; the which, as it allowed me no\r\nreasonable period of quiescence, frequently occasioned me an inordinate\r\ndistress. In which distress so much relief was afforded me by the delectable\r\ndiscourse of a friend and his commendable consolations, that I entertain a\r\nvery solid conviction that to them I owe it that I am not dead. But, as it\r\npleased Him, who, being infinite, has assigned by immutable law an end to\r\nall things mundane, my love, beyond all other fervent, and neither to be\r\nbroken nor bent by any force of determination, or counsel of prudence, or\r\nfear of manifest shame or ensuing danger, did nevertheless in course of time\r\nme abate of its own accord, in such wise that it has now left nought of\r\nitself in my mind but that pleasure which it is wont to afford to him who\r\ndoes not adventure too far out in navigating its deep seas; so that, whereas\r\nit was used to be grievous, now, all discomfort being done away, I find that\r\nwhich remains to be delightful. But the cessation of the pain has not\r\nbanished the memory of the kind offices done me by those who shared by\r\nsympathy the burden of my griefs; nor will it ever, I believe, pass from me\r\nexcept by death. And as among the virtues, gratitude is in my judgment most\r\nespecially to be commended, and ingratitude in equal measure to be censured,\r\ntherefore, that I show myself not ungrateful, I have resolved, now that I\r\nmay call myself to endeavour, in return for what I have received, to afford,\r\nso far as in me lies, some solace, if not to those who succoured and who,\r\nperchance, by reason of their good sense or good fortune, need it not, at\r\nleast to such as may be apt to receive it.\r\n\r\nAnd though my support or comfort, so to say, may be of little avail to the\r\nneedy, nevertheless it seems to me meet to offer it most readily where the\r\nneed is most apparent, because it will there be most serviceable and also\r\nmost kindly received. Who will deny, that it should be given, for all that\r\nit may be worth, to gentle ladies much rather than to men? Within their soft\r\nbosoms, betwixt fear and shame, they harbour secret fires of love, and how\r\nmuch of strength concealment adds to those fires, they know who have proved\r\nit. Moreover, restrained by the will, the caprice, the commandment of\r\nfathers, mothers, brothers, and husbands, confined most part of their time\r\nwithin the narrow compass of their chambers, they live, so to say, a life of\r\nvacant ease, and, yearning and renouncing in the same moment, meditate\r\ndivers matters which cannot all be cheerful. If thereby a melancholy bred of\r\namorous desire make entrance into their minds, it is like to tarry there to\r\ntheir sore distress, unless it be dispelled by a change of ideas. Besides\r\nwhich they have much less power to support such a weight than men. For, when\r\nmen are enamoured, their case is very different, as we may readily perceive.\r\nThey, if they are afflicted by a melancholy and heaviness of mood, have many\r\nways of relief and diversion; they may go where they will, may hear and see\r\nmany things, may hawk, hunt, fish, ride, play or traffic. By which means all\r\nare able to compose their minds, either in whole or in part, and repair the\r\nravage wrought by the dumpish mood, at least for some space of time; and\r\nshortly after, by one way or another, either solace ensues, or the dumps\r\nbecome less grievous. Wherefore, in some measure to compensate the injustice\r\nof Fortune, which to those whose strength is least, as we see it to be in\r\nthe delicate frames of ladies, has been most niggard of support, I, for the\r\nsuccour and diversion of such of them as love (for others may find\r\nsufficient solace in the needle and the spindle and the reel), do intend to\r\nrecount one hundred Novels or Fables or Parables or Stories, as we may\r\nplease to call them, which were recounted in ten days by an honourable\r\ncompany of seven ladies and three young men in the time of the late mortal\r\npestilence, as also some canzonets sung by the said ladies for their\r\ndelectation. In which pleasant novels will be found some passages of love\r\nrudely crossed, with other courses of events of which the issues are\r\nfelicitous, in times as well modern as ancient: from which stories the said\r\nladies, who shall read them, may derive both pleasure from the entertaining\r\nmatters set forth therein, and also good counsel, in that they may learn\r\nwhat to shun, and likewise what to pursue. Which cannot, I believe, come to\r\npass unless the dumps be banished by diversion of mind. And if it so happen\r\n(as God grant it may) let them give thanks to Love, who, liberating me from\r\nhis fetters, has given me the power to devote myself to their gratification.\r\n\r\n(1) For Fiammetta, i. e. Maria, natural daughter of Robert, King of Naples.\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nBeginneth here the first day of the Decameron, in which, when the author has\r\nset forth, how it came to pass that the persons, who appear hereafter met\r\ntogether for interchange of discourse, they, under the rule of Pampinea,\r\ndiscourse of such matters as most commend themselves to each in turn.\r\n--\r\n\r\nAs often, most gracious ladies, as I bethink me, how compassionate you are\r\nby nature one and all, I do not disguise from myself that the present work\r\nmust seem to you to have but a heavy and distressful prelude, in that it\r\nbears upon its very front what must needs revive the sorrowful memory of the\r\nlate mortal pestilence, the course whereof was grievous not merely to eye-\r\nwitnesses but to all who in any other wise had cognisance of it. But I would\r\nhave you know, that you need not therefore be fearful to read further, as if\r\nyour reading were ever to be accompanied by sighs and tears. This horrid\r\nbeginning will be to you even such as to wayfarers is a steep and rugged\r\nmountain, beyond which stretches a plain most fair and delectable, which the\r\ntoil of the ascent and descent does but serve to render more agreeable to\r\nthem; for, as the last degree of joy brings with it sorrow, so misery has\r\never its sequel of happiness. To this brief exordium of woe--brief, I say,\r\ninasmuch as it can be put within the compass of a few letters--succeed\r\nforthwith the sweets and delights which I have promised you, and which,\r\nperhaps, had I not done so, were not to have been expected from it. In\r\ntruth, had it been honestly possible to guide you whither I would bring you\r\nby a road less rough than this will be, I would gladly have so done. But,\r\nbecause without this review of the past, it would not be in my power to shew\r\nhow the matters, of which you will hereafter read, came to pass, I am almost\r\nbound of necessity to enter upon it, if I would write of them at all.\r\n\r\nI say, then, that the years of the beatific incarnation of the Son of God\r\nhad reached the tale of one thousand three hundred and forty-eight when in\r\nthe illustrious city of Florence, the fairest of all the cities of Italy,\r\nthere made its appearance that deadly pestilence, which, whether\r\ndisseminated by the influence of the celestial bodies, or sent upon us\r\nmortals by God in His just wrath by way of retribution for our iniquities,\r\nhad had its origin some years before in the East, whence, after destroying\r\nan innumerable multitude of living beings, it had propagated itself without\r\nrespite from place to place, and so, calamitously, had spread into the West.\r\n\r\nIn Florence, despite all that human wisdom and forethought could devise to\r\navert it, as the cleansing of the city from many impurities by officials\r\nappointed for the purpose, the refusal of entrance to all sick folk, and the\r\nadoption of many precautions for the preservation of health; despite also\r\nhumble supplications addressed to God, and often repeated both in public\r\nprocession and otherwise, by the devout; towards the beginning of the spring\r\nof the said year the doleful effects of the pestilence began to be horribly\r\napparent by symptoms that shewed as if miraculous.\r\n\r\nNot such were they as in the East, where an issue of blood from the nose was\r\na manifest sign of inevitable death; but in men and women alike it first\r\nbetrayed itself by the emergence of certain tumours in the groin or the\r\narmpits, some of which grew as large as a common apple, others as an egg,\r\nsome more, some less, which the common folk called gavoccioli. From the two\r\nsaid parts of the body this deadly gavocciolo soon began to propagate and\r\nspread itself in all directions indifferently; after which the form of the\r\nmalady began to change, black spots or livid making their appearance in many\r\ncases on the arm or the thigh or elsewhere, now few and large, now minute\r\nand numerous. And as the gavocciolo had been and still was an infallible\r\ntoken of approaching death, such also were these spots on whomsoever they\r\nshewed themselves. Which maladies seemed to set entirely at naught both the\r\nart of the physician and the virtues of physic; indeed, whether it was that\r\nthe disorder was of a nature to defy such treatment, or that the physicians\r\nwere at fault--besides the qualified there was now a multitude both of men\r\nand of women who practised without having received the slightest tincture of\r\nmedical science--and, being in ignorance of its source, failed to apply the\r\nproper remedies; in either case, not merely were those that recovered few,\r\nbut almost all within three days from the appearance of the said symptoms,\r\nsooner or later, died, and in most cases without any fever or other\r\nattendant malady.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the virulence of the pest was the greater by reason that\r\nintercourse was apt to convey it from the sick to the whole, just as fire\r\ndevours things dry or greasy when they are brought close to it. Nay, the\r\nevil went yet further, for not merely by speech or association with the sick\r\nwas the malady communicated to the healthy with consequent peril of common\r\ndeath; but any that touched the cloth of the sick or aught else that had\r\nbeen touched or used by them, seemed thereby to contract the disease.\r\n\r\nSo marvellous sounds that which I have now to relate, that, had not many,\r\nand I among them, observed it with their own eyes, I had hardly dared to\r\ncredit it, much less to set it down in writing, though I had had it from the\r\nlips of a credible witness.\r\n\r\nI say, then, that such was the energy of the contagion of the said\r\npestilence, that it was not merely propagated from man to man but, what is\r\nmuch more startling, it was frequently observed, that things which had\r\nbelonged to one sick or dead of the disease, if touched by some other living\r\ncreature, not of the human species, were the occasion, not merely of\r\nsickening, but of an almost instantaneous death. Whereof my own eyes (as I\r\nsaid a little before) had cognisance, one day among others, by the following\r\nexperience. The rags of a poor man who had died of the disease being strewn\r\nabout the open street, two hogs came thither, and after, as is their wont,\r\nno little trifling with their snouts, took the rags between their teeth and\r\ntossed them to and fro about their chaps; whereupon, almost immediately,\r\nthey gave a few turns, and fell down dead, as if by poison, upon the rags\r\nwhich in an evil hour they had disturbed.\r\n\r\nIn which circumstances, not to speak of many others of a similar or even\r\ngraver complexion, divers apprehensions and imaginations were engendered in\r\nthe minds of such as were left alive, inclining almost all of them to the\r\nsame harsh resolution, to wit, to shun and abhor all contact with the sick\r\nand all that belonged to them, thinking thereby to make each his own health\r\nsecure. Among whom there were those who thought that to live temperately and\r\navoid all excess would count for much as a preservative against seizures of\r\nthis kind. Wherefore they banded together, and, dissociating themselves from\r\nall others, formed communities in houses where there were no sick, and lived\r\na separate and secluded life, which they regulated with the utmost care,\r\navoiding every kind of luxury, but eating and drinking very moderately of\r\nthe most delicate viands and the finest wines, holding converse with none\r\nbut one another, lest tidings of sickness or death should reach them, and\r\ndiverting their minds with music and such other delights as they could\r\ndevise. Others, the bias of whose minds was in the opposite direction,\r\nmaintained, that to drink freely, frequent places of public resort, and take\r\ntheir pleasure with song and revel, sparing to satisfy no appetite, and to\r\nlaugh and mock at no event, was the sovereign remedy for so great an evil:\r\nand that which they affirmed they also put in practice, so far as they were\r\nable, resorting day and night, now to this tavern, now to that, drinking\r\nwith an entire disregard of rule or measure, and by preference making the\r\nhouses of others, as it were, their inns, if they but saw in them aught that\r\nwas particularly to their taste or liking; which they were readily able to\r\ndo, because the owners, seeing death imminent, had become as reckless of\r\ntheir property as of their lives; so that most of the houses were open to\r\nall comers, and no distinction was observed between the stranger who\r\npresented himself and the rightful lord. Thus, adhering ever to their\r\ninhuman determination to shun the sick, as far as possible, they ordered\r\ntheir life. In this extremity of our city's suffering and tribulation the\r\nvenerable authority of laws, human and divine, was abased and all but\r\ntotally dissolved, for lack of those who should have administered and\r\nenforced them, most of whom, like the rest of the citizens, were either dead\r\nor sick, or so hard bested for servants that they were unable to execute any\r\noffice; whereby every man was free to do what was right in his own eyes.\r\n\r\nNot a few there were who belonged to neither of the two said parties, but\r\nkept a middle course between them, neither laying the same restraint upon\r\ntheir diet as the former, nor allowing themselves the same license in\r\ndrinking and other dissipations as the latter, but living with a degree of\r\nfreedom sufficient to satisfy their appetites, and not as recluses. They\r\ntherefore walked abroad, carrying in their hands flowers or fragrant herbs\r\nor divers sorts of spices, which they frequently raised to their noses,\r\ndeeming it an excellent thing thus to comfort the brain with such perfumes,\r\nbecause the air seemed to be everywhere laden and reeking with the stench\r\nemitted by the dead and the dying and the odours of drugs.\r\n\r\nSome again, the most sound, perhaps, in judgment, as they we also the most\r\nharsh in temper, of all, affirmed that there was no medicine for the disease\r\nsuperior or equal in efficacy to flight; following which prescription a\r\nmultitude of men and women, negligent of all but themselves, deserted their\r\ncity, their houses, their estate, their kinsfolk, their goods, and went into\r\nvoluntary exile, or migrated to the country parts, as if God in visiting men\r\nwith this pestilence in requital of their iniquities would not pursue them\r\nwith His wrath, wherever they might be, but intended the destruction of such\r\nalone as remained within the circuit of the walls of the city; or deeming,\r\nperchance, that it was now time for all to flee from it, and that its last\r\nhour was come.\r\n\r\nOf the adherents of these divers opinions not all died, neither did all\r\nescape; but rather there were, of each sort and in every place, many that\r\nsickened, and by those who retained their health were treated after the\r\nexample which they themselves, while whole, had set, being everywhere left\r\nto languish in almost total neglect. Tedious were it to recount, how citizen\r\navoided citizen, how among neighbours was scarce found any that shewed\r\nfellow-feeling for another, how kinsfolk held aloof, and never met, or but\r\nrarely; enough that this sore affliction entered so deep into the minds of\r\nmen and women, that in the horror thereof brother was forsaken by brother,\r\nnephew by uncle, brother by sister, and oftentimes husband by wife; nay,\r\nwhat is more, and scarcely to be believed, fathers and mothers were found to\r\nabandon their own children, untended, unvisited, to their fate, as if they\r\nhad been strangers. Wherefore the sick of both sexes, whose number could not\r\nbe estimated, were left without resource but in the charity of friends (and\r\nfew such there were), or the interest of servants, who were hardly to be had\r\nat high rates and on unseemly terms, and being, moreover, one and all men\r\nand women of gross understanding, and for the most part unused to such\r\noffices, concerned themselves no farther than to supply the immediate and\r\nexpressed wants of the sick, and to watch them die; in which service they\r\nthemselves not seldom perished with their gains. In consequence of which\r\ndearth of servants and dereliction of the sick by neighbours, kinsfolk and\r\nfriends, it came to pass--a thing, perhaps, never before heard of that no\r\nwoman, however dainty, fair or well-born she might be, shrank, when stricken\r\nwith the disease, from the ministrations of a man, no matter whether he were\r\nyoung or no, or scrupled to expose to him every part of her body, with no\r\nmore shame than if he had been a woman, submitting of necessity to that\r\nwhich her malady required; wherefrom, perchance, there resulted in after\r\ntime some loss of modesty in such as recovered. Besides which many\r\nsuccumbed, who with proper attendance, would, perhaps, have escaped death;\r\nso that, what with the virulence of the plague and the lack of due tendance\r\nof the sick, the multitude of the deaths, that daily and nightly took place\r\nin the city, was such that those who heard the tale--not to say witnessed\r\nthe fact--were struck dumb with amazement. Whereby, practices contrary to\r\nthe former habits of the citizens could hardly fail to grow up among the\r\nsurvivors.\r\n\r\nIt had been, as to-day it still is, the custom for the women that were\r\nneighbours and of kin to the deceased to gather in his house with the women\r\nthat were most closely connected with him, to wail with them in common,\r\nwhile on the other hand his male kinsfolk and neighbours, with not a few of\r\nthe other citizens, and a due proportion of the clergy according to his\r\nquality, assembled without, in front of the house, to receive the corpse;\r\nand so the dead man was borne on the shoulders of his peers, with funeral\r\npomp of taper and dirge, to the church selected by him before his death.\r\nWhich rites, as the pestilence waxed in fury, were either in whole or in\r\ngreat part disused, and gave way to others of a novel order. For not only\r\ndid no crowd of women surround the bed of the dying, but many passed from\r\nthis life unregarded, and few indeed were they to whom were accorded the\r\nlamentations and bitter tears of sorrowing relations; nay, for the most\r\npart, their place was taken by the laugh, the jest, the festal gathering;\r\nobservances which the women, domestic piety in large measure set aside, had\r\nadopted with very great advantage to their health. Few also there were whose\r\nbodies were attended to the church by more than ten or twelve of their\r\nneighbours, and those not the honourable and respected citizens; but a sort\r\nof corpse-carriers drawn from the baser ranks who called themselves becchini\r\n(1) and performed such offices for hire, would shoulder the bier, and with\r\nhurried steps carry it, not to the church of the dead man's choice, but to\r\nthat which was nearest at hand, with four or six priests in front and a\r\ncandle or two, or, perhaps, none; nor did the priests distress themselves\r\nwith too long and solemn an office, but with the aid of the becchini hastily\r\nconsigned the corpse to the first tomb which they found untenanted. The\r\ncondition of lower, and, perhaps, in great measure of the middle ranks, of\r\nthe people shewed even worse and more deplorable; for, deluded by hope or\r\nconstrained by poverty, they stayed in their quarters, in their houses,\r\nwhere they sickened by thousands a day, and, being without service or help\r\nof any kind, were, so to speak, irredeemably devoted to the death which\r\novertook them. Many died daily or nightly in the public streets; of many\r\nothers, who died at home, the departure was hardly observed by their\r\nneighbours, until the stench of their putrefying bodies carried the tidings;\r\nand what with their corpses and the corpses of others who died on every hand\r\nthe whole place was a sepulchre.\r\n\r\nIt was the common practice of most of the neighbours, moved no less by fear\r\nof contamination by the putrefying bodies than by charity towards the\r\ndeceased, to drag the corpses out of the houses with their own hands, aided,\r\nperhaps, by a porter, if a porter was to be had, and to lay them in front of\r\nthe doors, where any one who made the round might have seen, especially in\r\nthe morning, more of them than he could count; afterwards they would have\r\nbiers brought up, or, in default, planks, whereon they laid them. Nor was it\r\nonce or twice only that one and the same bier carried two or three corpses\r\nat once; but quite a considerable number of such cases occurred, one bier\r\nsufficing for husband and wife, two or three brothers, father and son, and\r\nso forth. And times without number it happened, that, as two priests,\r\nbearing the cross, were on their way to perform the last office for some\r\none, three or four biers were brought up by the porters in rear of them, so\r\nthat, whereas the priests supposed that they had but one corpse to bury,\r\nthey discovered that there were six or eight, or sometimes more. Nor, for\r\nall their number, were their obsequies honoured by either tears or lights or\r\ncrowds of mourners; rather, it was come to this, that a dead man was then of\r\nno more account than a dead goat would be to-day. From all which it is\r\nabundantly manifest, that that lesson of patient resignation, which the\r\nsages were never able to learn from the slight and infrequent mishaps which\r\noccur in the natural course of events, was now brought home even to the\r\nminds of the simple by the magnitude of their disasters, so that they became\r\nindifferent to them.\r\n\r\nAs consecrated ground there was not in extent sufficient to provide tombs\r\nfor the vast multitude of corpses which day and night, and almost every\r\nhour, were brought in eager haste to the churches for interment, least of\r\nall, if ancient custom were to be observed and a separate resting-place\r\nassigned to each, they dug, for each graveyard, as soon as it was full, a\r\nhuge trench, in which they laid the corpses as they arrived by hundreds at a\r\ntime, piling them up as merchandise is stowed in the hold of a ship, tier\r\nupon tier, each covered with a little earth, until the trench would hold no\r\nmore. But I spare to rehearse with minute particularity each of the woes\r\nthat came upon our city, and say in brief, that, harsh as was the tenor of\r\nher fortunes, the surrounding country knew no mitigation, for there--not to\r\nspeak of the castles, each, as it were, a little city in itself--in\r\nsequestered village, or on the open champaign, by the wayside, on the farm,\r\nin the homestead, the poor hapless husbandmen and their families, forlorn of\r\nphysicians' care or servants' tendance, perished day and night alike, not as\r\nmen, but rather as beasts. Wherefore, they too, like the citizens, abandoned\r\nall rule of life, all habit of industry, all counsel of prudence; nay, one\r\nand all, as if expecting each day to be their last, not merely ceased to aid\r\nNature to yield her fruit in due season of their beasts and their lands and\r\ntheir past labours, but left no means unused, which ingenuity could devise,\r\nto waste their accumulated store; denying shelter to their oxen, asses,\r\nsheep, goats, pigs, fowls, nay, even to their dogs, man's most faithful\r\ncompanions, and driving them out into the fields to roam at large amid the\r\nunsheaved, nay, unreaped corn. Many of which, as if endowed with reason,\r\ntook their fill during the day, and returned home at night without any\r\nguidance of herdsman. But enough of the country! What need we add, but\r\n(reverting to the city) that such and so grievous was the harshness of\r\nheaven, and perhaps in some degree of man, that, what with the fury of the\r\npestilence, the panic of those whom it spared, and their consequent neglect\r\nor desertion of not a few of the stricken in their need, it is believed\r\nwithout any manner of doubt, that between March and the ensuing July upwards\r\nof a hundred thousand human beings lost their lives within the walls of the\r\ncity of Florence, which before the deadly visitation would not have been\r\nsupposed to contain so many people! How many grand palaces, how many stately\r\nhomes, how many splendid residences, once full of retainers, of lords, of\r\nladies, were now left desolate of all, even to the meanest servant! How many\r\nfamilies of historic fame, of vast ancestral domains, and wealth proverbial,\r\nfound now no scion to continue the succession! How many brave men, how many\r\nfair ladies, how many gallant youths, whom any physician, were he Galen,\r\nHippocrates, or Aesculapius himself, would have pronounced in the soundest\r\nof health, broke fast with their kinsfolk, comrades and friends in the\r\nmorning, and when evening came, supped with their forefathers in the other\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIrksome it is to myself to rehearse in detail so sorrowful a history.\r\nWherefore, being minded to pass over so much thereof as I fairly can, I say,\r\nthat our city, being thus well-nigh depopulated, it so happened, as I\r\nafterwards learned from one worthy of credit, that on a Tuesday morning\r\nafter Divine Service the venerable church of Santa Maria Novella was almost\r\ndeserted save for the presence of seven young ladies habited sadly in\r\nkeeping with the season. All were connected either by blood or at least as\r\nfriends or neighbours and fair and of good understanding were they all, as\r\nalso of noble birth, gentle manners, and a modest sprightliness. In age none\r\nexceeded twenty-eight, or fell short of eighteen years. Their names I would\r\nset down in due form, had I not good reason to with hold them, being\r\nsolicitous lest the matters which here ensue, as told and heard by them,\r\nshould in after time be occasion of reproach to any of them, in view of the\r\nample indulgence which was then, for the reasons heretofore set forth,\r\naccorded to the lighter hours of persons of much riper years than they, but\r\nwhich the manners of to-day have somewhat restricted; nor would I furnish\r\nmaterial to detractors, ever ready to bestow their bite where praise is due,\r\nto cast by invidious speech the least slur upon the honour of these noble\r\nladies. Wherefore, that what each says may be apprehended without confusion,\r\nI intend to give them names more or less appropriate to the character of\r\neach. The first, then, being the eldest of the seven, we will call Pampinea,\r\nthe second Fiammetta, the third Filomena, the fourth Emilia, the fifth we\r\nwill distinguish as Lauretta, the sixth as Neifile, and the last, not\r\nwithout reason, shall be named Elisa.\r\n\r\n'Twas not of set purpose but by mere chance that these ladies met in the\r\nsame part of the church; but at length grouping themselves into a sort of\r\ncircle, after heaving a few sighs, they gave up saying paternosters, and\r\nbegan to converse (among other topics) on the times.\r\n\r\nSo they continued for awhile, and then Pampinea, the rest listening in\r\nsilent attention, thus began:--\"Dear ladies mine, often have I heard it\r\nsaid, and you doubtless as well as I, that wrong is done to none by whoso\r\nbut honestly uses his reason. And to fortify, preserve, and defend his life\r\nto the utmost of his power is the dictate of natural reason in everyone that\r\nis born. Which right is accorded in such measure that in defence thereof men\r\nhave been held blameless in taking life. And if this be allowed by the laws,\r\nalbeit on their stringency depends the well-being of every mortal, how much\r\nmore exempt from censure should we, and all other honest folk, be in taking\r\nsuch means as we may for the preservation of our life? As often as I bethink\r\nme how we have been occupied this morning, and not this morning only, and\r\nwhat has been the tenor of our conversation, I perceive--and you will\r\nreadily do the like--that each of us is apprehensive on her own account; nor\r\nthereat do I marvel, but at this I do marvel greatly, that, though none of\r\nus lacks a woman's wit, yet none of us has recourse to any means to avert\r\nthat which we all justly fear. Here we tarry, as if, methinks, for no other\r\npurpose than to bear witness to the number of the corpses that are brought\r\nhither for interment, or to hearken if the brothers there within, whose\r\nnumber is now almost reduced to nought, chant their offices at the canonical\r\nhours, or, by our weeds of woe, to obtrude on the attention of every one\r\nthat enters, the nature and degree of our sufferings.\r\n\r\n\"And if we quit the church, we see dead or sick folk carried about, or we\r\nsee those, who for their crimes were of late condemned to exile by the\r\noutraged majesty of the public laws, but who now, in contempt of those laws,\r\nwell knowing that their ministers are a prey to death or disease, have\r\nreturned, and traverse the city in packs, making it hideous with their\r\nriotous antics; or else we see the refuse of the people, fostered on our\r\nblood, becchini, as they call themselves, who for our torment go prancing\r\nabout here and there and everywhere, making mock of our miseries in\r\nscurrilous songs. Nor hear we aught but:--Such and such are dead; or, Such\r\nand such art dying; and should hear dolorous wailing on every hand, were\r\nthere but any to wail. Or go we home, what see we there? I know not if you\r\nare in like case with me; but there, where once were servants in plenty, I\r\nfind none left but my maid, and shudder with terror, and feel the very hairs\r\nof my head to stand on end; and turn or tarry where I may, I encounter the\r\nghosts of the departed, not with their wonted mien, but with something\r\nhorrible in their aspect that appals me. For which reasons church and street\r\nand home are alike distressful to me, and the more so that none, methinks,\r\nhaving means and place of retirement as we have, abides here save only we;\r\nor if any such there be, they are of those, as my senses too often have\r\nborne witness, who make no distinction between things honourable and their\r\nopposites, so they but answer the cravings of appetite, and, alone or in\r\ncompany, do daily and nightly what things soever give promise of most\r\ngratification. Nor are these secular persons alone; but such as live recluse\r\nin monasteries break their rule, and give themselves up to carnal pleasures,\r\npersuading themselves that they are permissible to them, and only forbidden\r\nto others, and, thereby thinking to escape, are become unchaste and\r\ndissolute. If such be our circumstances--and such most manifestly they\r\nare--what do we here? what wait we for? what dream we of? why are we less\r\nprompt to provide for our own safety than the rest of the citizens? Is life\r\nless dear to us than to all other women? or think we that the bond, which\r\nunites soul and body is stronger in us than in others, so that there is no\r\nblow that may light upon it, of which we need be apprehensive? If so, we\r\nerr, we are deceived. What insensate folly were it in us so to believe! We\r\nhave but to call to mind the number and condition of those, young as we, and\r\nof both sexes, who have succumbed to this cruel pestilence, to find therein\r\nconclusive evidence to the contrary. And lest from lethargy or indolence we\r\nfall into the vain imagination that by some lucky accident we may in some\r\nway or another, when we would, escape--I know not if your opinion accord\r\nwith mine--I should deem it most wise in us, our case being what it is, if,\r\nas many others have done before us, and are still doing, we were to quit\r\nthis place, and, shunning like death the evil example of others, betake\r\nourselves to the country, and there live as honourable women on one of the\r\nestates, of which none of us has any lack, with all cheer of festal\r\ngathering and other delights, so long as in no particular we overstep the\r\nbounds of reason. There we shall hear the chant of birds, have sight of\r\nverdant hills and plains, of cornfields undulating like the sea, of trees of\r\na thousand sorts; there also we shall have a larger view of the heavens,\r\nwhich, however harsh to usward yet deny not their eternal beauty; things\r\nfairer far for eye to rest on than the desolate walls of our city. Moreover,\r\nwe shall there breathe a fresher air, find ampler store of things meet for\r\nsuch as live in these times, have fewer causes of annoy. For, though the\r\nhusbandmen die there, even as here the citizens, they are dispersed in\r\nscattered homesteads, and 'tis thus less painful to witness. Nor, so far as\r\nI can see, is there a soul here whom we shall desert; rather we may truly\r\nsay, that we are ourselves deserted; for, our kinsfolk being either dead or\r\nfled in fear of death, no more regardful of us than if we were strangers, we\r\nare left alone in our great affliction. No censure, then, can fall on us if\r\nwe do as I propose; and otherwise grievous suffering, perhaps death, may\r\nensue. Wherefore, if you agree, 'tis my advice, that, attended by our maids\r\nwith all things needful, we sojourn, now on this, now on the other estate,\r\nand in such way of life continue, until we see--if death should not first\r\novertake us--the end which Heaven reserves for these events. And I remind\r\nyou that it will be at least as seemly in us to leave with honour, as in\r\nothers, of whom there are not a few, to stay with dishonour.\"\r\n\r\nThe other ladies praised Pampinea's plan, and indeed were so prompt to\r\nfollow it, that they had already begun to discuss the manner in some detail,\r\nas if they were forthwith to rise from their seats and take the road, when\r\nFilomena, whose judgment was excellent, interposed, saying:--\"Ladies, though\r\nPampinea has spoken to most excellent effect, yet it were not well to be so\r\nprecipitate as you seem disposed to be. Bethink you that we are all women;\r\nnor is there any here so young, but she is of years to understand how women\r\nare minded towards one another, when they are alone together, and how ill\r\nthey are able to rule themselves without the guidance of some man. We are\r\nsensitive, perverse, suspicious, pusillanimous and timid; wherefore I much\r\nmisdoubt, that, if we find no other guidance than our own, this company is\r\nlike to break up sooner, and with less credit to us, than it should. Against\r\nwhich it were well to provide at the outset.\" Said then Elisa:--\"Without\r\ndoubt man is woman's head, and, without man's governance, it is seldom that\r\naught that we do is brought to a commendable conclusion. But how are we to\r\ncome by the men? Every one of us here knows that her kinsmen are for the\r\nmost part dead, and that the survivors are dispersed, one here, one there,\r\nwe know not where, bent each on escaping the same fate as ourselves; nor\r\nwere it seemly to seek the aid of strangers; for, as we are in quest of\r\nhealth, we must find some means so to order matters that, wherever we seek\r\ndiversion or repose, trouble and scandal do not follow us.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the ladies were thus conversing, there came into the church three\r\nyoung men, young, I say, but not so young that the age of the youngest was\r\nless than twenty-five years; in whom neither the sinister course of events,\r\nnor the loss of friends or kinsfolk, nor fear for their own safety, had\r\navailed to quench, or even temper, the ardour of their love. The first was\r\ncalled Pamfilo, the second Filostrato, and the third Dioneo. Very debonair\r\nand chivalrous were they all; and in this troublous time they were seeking\r\nif haply, to their exceeding great solace, they might have sight of their\r\nfair friends, all three of whom chanced to be among the said seven ladies,\r\nbesides some that were of kin to the young men. At one and the same moment\r\nthey recognised the ladies and were recognised by them: wherefore, with a\r\ngracious smile, Pampinea thus began:--\"Lo, fortune is propitious to our\r\nenterprise, having vouchsafed us the good offices of these young men, who\r\nare as gallant as they are discreet, and will gladly give us their guidance\r\nand escort, so we but take them into our service.\" Whereupon Neifile,\r\ncrimson from brow to neck with the blush of modesty, being one of those that\r\nhad a lover among the young men, said:--\"For God's sake, Pampinea, have a\r\ncare what you say. Well assured am I that nought but good can be said of any\r\nof them, and I deem them fit for office far more onerous than this which you\r\npropose for them, and their good and honourable company worthy of ladies\r\nfairer by far and more tenderly to be cherished than such as we. But 'tis no\r\nsecret that they love some of us here; wherefore I misdoubt that, if we take\r\nthem with us, we may thereby give occasion for scandal and censure merited\r\nneither by us nor by them.\" \"That,\" said Filomena, \"is of no consequence; so\r\nI but live honestly, my conscience gives me no disquietude; if others\r\nasperse me, God and the truth will take arms in my defence. Now, should they\r\nbe disposed to attend us, of a truth we might say with Pampinea, that\r\nfortune favours our enterprise.\" The silence which followed betokened\r\nconsent on the part of the other ladies, who then with one accord resolved\r\nto call the young men, and acquaint them with their purpose, and pray them\r\nto be of their company. So without further parley Pampinea, who had a\r\nkinsman among the young men, rose and approached them where they stood\r\nintently regarding them; and greeting them gaily, she opened to them their\r\nplan, and besought them on the part of herself and her friends to join their\r\ncompany on terms of honourable and fraternal comradeship. At first the young\r\nmen thought she did but trifle with them; but when they saw that she was in\r\nearnest, they answered with alacrity that they were ready, and promptly,\r\neven before they left the church, set matters in train for their departure.\r\nSo all things meet being first sent forward in due order to their intended\r\nplace of sojourn, the ladies with some of their maids, and the three young\r\nmen, each attended by a man-servant, sallied forth of the city on the\r\nmorrow, being Wednesday, about daybreak, and took the road; nor had they\r\njourneyed more than two short miles when they arrived at their destination.\r\nThe estate (2) lay upon a little hill some distance from the nearest\r\nhighway, and, embowered in shrubberies of divers hues, and other greenery,\r\nafforded the eye a pleasant prospect. On the summit of the hill was a palace\r\nwith galleries, halls and chambers, disposed around a fair and spacious\r\ncourt, each very fair in itself, and the goodlier to see for the gladsome\r\npictures with which it was adorned; the whole set amidst meads and gardens\r\nlaid out with marvellous art, wells of the coolest water, and vaults of the\r\nfinest wines, things more suited to dainty drinkers than to sober and\r\nhonourable women. On their arrival the company, to their no small delight,\r\nfound their beds already made, the rooms well swept and garnished with\r\nflowers of every sort that the season could afford, and the floors carpeted\r\nwith rushes. When they were seated, Dioneo, a gallant who had not his match\r\nfor courtesy and wit, spoke thus:--\"My ladies, 'tis not our forethought so\r\nmuch as your own mother-wit that has guided us hither. How you mean to\r\ndispose of your cares I know not; mine I left behind me within the city-gate\r\nwhen I issued thence with you a brief while ago. Wherefore, I pray you,\r\neither address yourselves to make merry, to laugh and sing with me (so far,\r\nI mean, as may consist with your dignity), or give me leave to hie me back\r\nto the stricken city, there to abide with my cares.\" To whom blithely\r\nPampinea replied, as if she too had cast off all her cares:--\"Well sayest\r\nthou, Dioneo, excellent well; gaily we mean to live; 'twas a refuge from\r\nsorrow that here we sought, nor had we other cause to come hither. But, as\r\nno anarchy can long endure, I who initiated the deliberations of which this\r\nfair company is the fruit, do now, to the end that our joy may be lasting,\r\ndeem it expedient, that there be one among us in chief authority, honoured\r\nand obeyed by us as our superior, whose exclusive care it shall be to devise\r\nhow we may pass our time blithely. And that each in turn may prove the\r\nweight of the care, as well as enjoy the pleasure, of sovereignty, and, no\r\ndistinction being made of sex, envy be felt by none by reason of exclusion\r\nfrom the office; I propose, that the weight and honour be borne by each one\r\nfor a day; and let the first to bear sway be chosen by us all, those that\r\nfollow to be appointed towards the vesper hour by him or her who shall have\r\nhad the signory for that day; and let each holder of the signory be, for the\r\ntime, sole arbiter of the place and manner in which we are to pass our\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nPampinea's speech was received with the utmost applause, and with one accord\r\nshe was chosen queen for the first day. Whereupon Filomena hied her lightly\r\nto a bay-tree, having often heard of the great honour in which its leaves,\r\nand such as were deservedly crowned therewith, were worthy to be holden; and\r\nhaving gathered a few sprays, she made thereof a goodly wreath of honour,\r\nand set it on Pampinea's head; which wreath was thenceforth, while their\r\ncompany endured, the visible sign of the wearer's sway and sovereignty.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was Queen Pampinea crowned than she bade all be silent. She then\r\ncaused summon to her presence their four maids, and the servants of the\r\nthree young men, and, all keeping silence, said to them:--\"That I may shew\r\nyou all at once, how, well still giving place to better, our company may\r\nflourish and endure, as long as it shall pleasure us, with order meet and\r\nassured delight and without reproach, I first of all constitute Dioneo's\r\nman, Parmeno, my seneschal, and entrust him with the care and control of all\r\nour household, and all that belongs to the service of the hall. Pamfilo's\r\nman, Sirisco, I appoint treasurer and chancellor of our exchequer; and be he\r\never answerable to Parmeno. While Parmeno and Sirisco are too busy about\r\ntheir duties to serve their masters, let Filostrato's man, Tindaro, have\r\ncharge of the chambers of all three. My maid, Misia, and Filomena's maid,\r\nLicisca, will keep in the kitchen, and with all due diligence prepare such\r\ndishes as Parmeno shall bid them. Lauretta's maid, Chimera, and Fiammetta's\r\nmaid, Stratilia we make answerable for the ladies' chambers, and wherever we\r\nmay take up our quarters, let them see that all is spotless. And now we\r\nenjoin you, one and all alike, as you value our favour, that none of you, go\r\nwhere you may, return whence you may, hear or see what you may, bring us any\r\ntidings but such as be cheerful.\" These orders thus succinctly given were\r\nreceived with universal approval. Whereupon Pampinea rose, and said\r\ngaily:--\"Here are gardens, meads, and other places delightsome enough, where\r\nyou may wander at will, and take your pleasure; but on the stroke of tierce,\r\n(3) let all be here to breakfast in the shade.\"\r\n\r\nThus dismissed by their new queen the gay company sauntered gently through a\r\ngarden, the young men saying sweet things to the fair ladies, who wove fair\r\ngarlands of divers sorts of leaves and sang love-songs.\r\n\r\nHaving thus spent the time allowed them by the queen, they returned to the\r\nhouse, where they found that Parmeno had entered on his office with zeal;\r\nfor in a hall on the ground-floor they saw tables covered with the whitest\r\nof cloths, and beakers that shone like silver, and sprays of broom scattered\r\neverywhere. So, at the bidding of the queen, they washed their hands, and\r\nall took their places as marshalled by Parmeno. Dishes, daintily prepared,\r\nwere served, and the finest wines were at hand; the three serving-men did\r\ntheir office noiselessly; in a word all was fair and ordered in a seemly\r\nmanner; whereby the spirits of the company rose, and they seasoned their\r\nviands with pleasant jests and sprightly sallies. Breakfast done, the tables\r\nwere removed, and the queen bade fetch instruments of music; for all, ladies\r\nand young men alike, knew how to tread a measure, and some of them played\r\nand sang with great skill: so, at her command, Dioneo having taken a lute,\r\nand Fiammetta a viol, they struck up a dance in sweet concert; and, the\r\nservants being dismissed to their repast, the queen, attended by the other\r\nladies and the two young men, led off a stately carol; which ended they fell\r\nto singing ditties dainty and gay. Thus they diverted themselves until the\r\nqueen, deeming it time to retire to rest, dismissed them all for the night.\r\nSo the three young men and the ladies withdrew to their several quarters,\r\nwhich were in different parts of the palace. There they found the beds well\r\nmade, and abundance of flowers, as in the hall; and so they undressed, and\r\nwent to bed.\r\n\r\nShortly after none (4) the queen rose, and roused the rest of the ladies, as\r\nalso the young men, averring that it was injurious to health to sleep long\r\nin the daytime. They therefore hied them to a meadow, where the grass grew\r\ngreen and luxuriant, being nowhere scorched by the sun, and a light breeze\r\ngently fanned them. So at the queen's command they all ranged themselves in\r\na circle on the grass, and hearkened while she thus spoke:--\r\n\r\n\"You mark that the sun is high, the heat intense, and the silence unbroken\r\nsave by the cicalas among the olive-trees. It were therefore the height of\r\nfolly to quit this spot at present. Here the air is cool and the prospect\r\nfair, and here, observe, are dice and chess. Take, then, your pleasure as\r\nyou may be severally minded; but, if you take my advice, you will find\r\npastime for the hot hours before us, not in play, in which the loser must\r\nneeds be vexed, and neither the winner nor the onlooker much the better\r\npleased, but in telling of stories, in which the invention of one may afford\r\nsolace to all the company of his hearers. You will not each have told a\r\nstory before the sun will be low, and the heat abated, so that we shall be\r\nable to go and severally take our pleasure where it may seem best to each.\r\nWherefore, if my proposal meet with your approval--for in this I am disposed\r\nto consult your pleasure--let us adopt it; if not, divert yourselves as best\r\nyou may, until the vesper hour.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen's proposal being approved by all, ladies and men alike, she\r\nadded:--\"So please you, then, I ordain, that, for this first day, we be free\r\nto discourse of such matters as most commend themselves, to each in turn.\"\r\nShe then addressed Pamfilo, who sat on her right hand, bidding him with a\r\ngracious air to lead off with one of his stories. And prompt at the word of\r\ncommand, Pamfilo, while all listened intently, thus began:--\r\n\r\n(1) Probably from the name of the pronged or hooked implement with which\r\nthey dragged the corpses out of the houses.\r\n\r\n(2) Identified by tradition with the Villa Palmieri (now Crawford) on the\r\nslope of Fiesole.\r\n\r\n(3) The canonical hour following prime, roughly speaking about 9 a.m.\r\n\r\n(4) The canonical hour following sext, i.e. 3 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL I.\r\n\r\n--\r\nSer Ciappelletto cheats a holy friar by a false confession, and dies; and,\r\nhaving lived as a very bad man, is, on his death, reputed a saint, and\r\ncalled San Ciappelletto.\r\n--\r\n\r\nA seemly thing it is, dearest ladies, that whatever we do, it be begun in\r\nthe holy and awful name of Him who was the maker of all. Wherefore, as it\r\nfalls to me to lead the way in this your enterprise of story telling, I\r\nintend to begin with one of His wondrous works, that, by hearing thereof,\r\nour hopes in Him, in whom is no change, may be established, and His name be\r\nby us forever lauded. 'Tis manifest that, as things temporal are all doomed\r\nto pass and perish, so within and without they abound with trouble and\r\nanguish and travail, and are subject to infinite perils; nor, save for the\r\nespecial grace of God, should we, whose being is bound up with and forms\r\npart of theirs, have either the strength to endure or the wisdom to combat\r\ntheir adverse influences. By which grace we are visited and penetrated (so\r\nwe must believe) not by reason of any merit of our own, but solely out of\r\nthe fulness of God's own goodness, and in answer to the prayers of those\r\nwho, being mortal like ourselves, did faithfully observe His ordinances\r\nduring their lives, and are now become blessed for ever with Him in heaven.\r\nTo whom, as to advocates taught by experience all that belongs to our\r\nfrailty, we, not daring, perchance, to present our petitions in the presence\r\nof so great a judge, make known our requests for such things as we deem\r\nexpedient for us. And of His mercy richly abounding to usward we have\r\nfurther proof herein, that, no keenness of mortal vision being able in any\r\ndegree to penetrate the secret counsels of the Divine mind, it sometimes,\r\nperchance, happens, that, in error of judgment, we make one our advocate\r\nbefore His Majesty, who is banished from His presence in eternal exile, and\r\nyet He to whom nothing is hidden, having regard rather to the sincerity of\r\nour prayers than to our ignorance or the banishment of the intercessor,\r\nhears us no less than if the intercessor were in truth one of the blest who\r\nenjoy the light of His countenance. Which the story that I am about to\r\nrelate may serve to make apparent; apparent, I mean, according to the\r\nstandard or the judgment of man, not of God.\r\n\r\nThe story goes, then, that Musciatto Franzesi, a great and wealthy merchant,\r\nbeing made a knight in France, and being to attend Charles Sansterre,\r\nbrother of the King of France, when he came into Tuscany at the instance and\r\nwith the support of Pope Boniface, found his affairs, as often happens to\r\nmerchants, to be much involved in divers quarters, and neither easily nor\r\nsuddenly to be adjusted; wherefore he determined to place them in the hands\r\nof commissioners, and found no difficulty except as to certain credits given\r\nto some Burgundians, for the recovery of which he doubted whether he could\r\ncome by a competent agent; for well he knew that the Burgundians were\r\nviolent men and ill-conditioned and faithless; nor could he call to mind any\r\nman so bad that he could with confidence oppose his guile to theirs. After\r\nlong pondering the matter, he recollected one Ser Ciapperello da Prato, who\r\nmuch frequented his house in Paris. Who being short of stature and very\r\naffected, the French who knew not the meaning of Cepparello, (1) but\r\nsupposed that it meant the same as Cappello, i. e. garland, in their\r\nvernacular, called him not Cappello, but Ciappelletto by reason of his\r\ndiminutive size; and as Ciappelletto he was known everywhere, whereas few\r\npeople knew him as Ciapperello. Now Ciappelletto's manner of life was thus.\r\nHe was by profession a notary, and his pride was to make false documents; he\r\nwould have made them as often as he was asked, and more readily without fee\r\nthan another at a great price; few indeed he made that were not false, and,\r\ngreat was his shame when they were discovered. False witness he bore,\r\nsolicited or unsolicited, with boundless delight; and, as oaths were in\r\nthose days had in very great respect in France, he, scrupling not to\r\nforswear himself, corruptly carried the day in every case in which he was\r\nsummoned faithfully to attest the truth. He took inordinate delight, and\r\nbestirred himself with great zeal, in fomenting ill-feeling, enmities,\r\ndissensions between friends, kinsfolk and all other folk; and the more\r\ncalamitous were the consequences the better he was pleased. Set him on\r\nmurder, or any other foul crime, and he never hesitated, but went about it\r\nwith alacrity; he had been known on more than one occasion to inflict wounds\r\nor death by preference with his own hands. He was a profuse blasphemer of\r\nGod and His saints, and that on the most trifling occasions, being of all\r\nmen the most irascible. He was never seen at Church, held all the sacraments\r\nvile things, and derided them in language of horrible ribaldry. On the other\r\nhand he resorted readily to the tavern and other places of evil repute, and\r\nfrequented them. He was as fond of women as a dog is of the stick: in the\r\nuse against nature he had not his match among the most abandoned. He would\r\nhave pilfered and stolen as a matter of conscience, as a holy man would make\r\nan oblation. Most gluttonous he was and inordinately fond of his cups,\r\nwhereby he sometimes brought upon himself both shame and suffering. He was\r\nalso a practised gamester and thrower of false dice. But why enlarge so much\r\nupon him? Enough that he was, perhaps, the worst man that ever was born.\r\n\r\nThe rank and power of Musciatto Franzesi had long been this reprobate's\r\nmainstay, serving in many instances to secure him considerate treatment on\r\nthe part of the private persons whom he frequently, and the court which he\r\nunremittingly, outraged. So Musciatto, having bethought him of this Ser\r\nCepparello, with whose way of life he was very well acquainted, judged him\r\nto be the very sort of person to cope with the guile of the Burgundians. He\r\ntherefore sent for him, and thus addressed him:--\"Ser Ciappelletto, I am, as\r\nthou knowest, about to leave this place for good; and among those with whom\r\nI have to settle accounts are certain Burgundians, very wily knaves; nor\r\nknow I the man whom I could more fitly entrust with the recovery of my money\r\nthan thyself. Wherefore, as thou hast nothing to do at present, if thou wilt\r\nundertake this business, I will procure thee the favour of the court, and\r\ngive thee a reasonable part of what thou shalt recover.\" Ser Ciappelletto,\r\nbeing out of employment, and by no means in easy circumstances, and about to\r\nlose Musciatto, so long his mainstay and support, without the least demur,\r\nfor in truth he had hardly any choice, made his mind up and answered that he\r\nwas ready to go. So the bargain was struck. Armed with the power of attorney\r\nand the royal letters commendatory, Ser Ciappelletto took leave of Messer\r\nMusciatto and hied him to Burgundy, where he was hardly known to a soul. He\r\nset about the business which had brought him thither, the recovery of the\r\nmoney, in a manner amicable and considerate, foreign to his nature, as if he\r\nwere minded to reserve his severity to the last. While thus occupied, he was\r\nfrequently at the house of two Florentine usurers, who treated him with\r\ngreat distinction out of regard for Messer Musciatto; and there it so\r\nhappened that he fell sick. The two brothers forthwith placed physicians and\r\nservants in attendance upon him, and omitted no means meet and apt for the\r\nrestoration of his health. But all remedies proved unavailing; for being now\r\nold, and having led, as the physicians reported, a disorderly life, he went\r\ndaily from bad to worse like one stricken with a mortal disease. This\r\ngreatly disconcerted the two brothers; and one day, hard by the room in\r\nwhich Ser Ciappelletto lay sick, they began to talk about him; saying one to\r\nthe other:--\"What shall we do with this man? We are hard bested indeed on\r\nhis account. If we turn him out of the house, sick as he is, we shall not\r\nonly incur grave censure, but shall evince a signal want of sense; for folk\r\nmust know the welcome we gave him in the first instance, the solicitude with\r\nwhich we have had him treated and tended since his illness, during which\r\ntime he could not possibly do aught to displease us, and yet they would see\r\nhim suddenly turned out of our house sick unto death. On the other hand he\r\nhas been so bad a man that he is sure not to confess or receive any of the\r\nChurch's sacraments; and dying thus unconfessed, he will be denied burial in\r\nchurch, but will be cast out into some ditch like a dog; nay, 'twill be all\r\none if he do confess, for such and so horrible have been his crimes that no\r\nfriar or priest either will or can absolve him; and so, dying without\r\nabsolution, he will still be cast out into the ditch. In which case the folk\r\nof these parts, who reprobate our trade as iniquitous and revile it all day\r\nlong, and would fain rob us, will seize their opportunity, and raise a\r\ntumult, and make a raid upon our houses, crying:--'Away with these Lombard\r\nwhom the Church excludes from her pale;' and will certainly strip us of our\r\ngoods, and perhaps take our lives also; so that in any case we stand to lose\r\nif this man die.\"\r\n\r\nSer Ciappelletto, who, as we said, lay close at hand while they thus spoke,\r\nand whose hearing was sharpened, as is often the case, by his malady,\r\noverheard all that they said about him. So he called them to him, and said\r\nto them:--\"I would not have you disquiet yourselves in regard of me, or\r\napprehend loss to befall you by my death. I have heard what you have said of\r\nme and have no doubt that 'twould be as you say, if matters took the course\r\nyou anticipate; but I am minded that it shall be otherwise. I have committed\r\nso many offences against God in the course of my life, that one more in the\r\nhour of my death will make no difference whatever to the account. So seek\r\nout and bring hither the worthiest and most holy friar you can find, and\r\nleave me to settle your affairs and mine upon a sound and solid basis, with\r\nwhich you may rest satisfied.\" The two brothers had not much hope of the\r\nresult, but yet they went to a friary and asked for a holy and discreet man\r\nto hear the confession of a Lombard that was sick in their house, and\r\nreturned with an aged man of just and holy life, very learned in the\r\nScriptures, and venerable and held in very great and especial reverence by\r\nall the citizens. As soon as he had entered the room where Ser Ciappelletto\r\nwas lying, and had taken his place by his side, he began gently to comfort\r\nhim: then he asked him how long it was since he was confessed. Whereto Ser\r\nCiappelletto, who had never been confessed, answered:--\"Father, it is my\r\nconstant practice to be confessed at least once a week, and many a week I am\r\nconfessed more often; but true it is, that, since I have been sick, now\r\neight days, I have made no confession, so sore has been my affliction.\r\n\"Son,\" said the friar, \"thou hast well done, and well for thee, if so thou\r\ncontinue to do; as thou dost confess so often, I see that my labour of\r\nhearkening and questioning will be slight.\" \"Nay but, master friar,\" said\r\nSer Ciappelletto, \"I say not so; I have not confessed so often but that I\r\nwould fain make a general confession of all my sins that I have committed,\r\nso far as I can recall them, from the day of my birth to the present time;\r\nand therefore I pray you, my good father, to question me precisely in every\r\nparticular just as if I had never been confessed. And spare me not by reason\r\nof my sickness, for I had far rather do despite to my flesh than, sparing\r\nit, risk the perdition of my soul, which my Saviour redeemed with His\r\nprecious blood.\"\r\n\r\nThe holy man was mightily delighted with these words, which seemed to him to\r\nbetoken a soul in a state of grace. He therefore signified to Ser\r\nCiappelletto his high approval of this practice; and then began by asking\r\nhim whether he had ever sinned carnally with a woman. Whereto Ser\r\nCiappelletto answered with a sigh:--\"My father, I scruple to tell you the\r\ntruth in this matter, fearing lest I sin in vain-glory.\" \"Nay, but,\" said\r\nthe friar, \"speak boldly; none ever sinned by telling the truth, either in\r\nconfession or otherwise.\" \"Then,\" said Ser Ciappelletto, \"as you bid me\r\nspeak boldly, I will tell you the truth of this matter. I am virgin even as\r\nwhen I issued from my mother's womb.\" \"Now God's blessing on thee,\" said the\r\nfriar, \"well done; and the greater is thy merit in that, hadst thou so\r\nwilled, thou mightest have done otherwise far more readily than we who are\r\nunder constraint of rule.\" He then proceeded to ask, whether he had offended\r\nGod by gluttony. Whereto Ser Ciappelletto, heaving a heavy sigh, answered\r\nthat he had so offended for, being wont to fast not only in Lent like other\r\ndevout persons, but at least thrice days in every week, taking nothing but\r\nbread and water, he had quaffed the water with as good a gusto and as much\r\nenjoyment, more particularly when fatigued by devotion or pilgrimage, as\r\ngreat drinkers quaff their wine; and oftentimes he had felt a craving for\r\nsuch dainty dishes of herbs as ladies make when they go into the country,\r\nand now and again he had relished his food more than seemed to him meet in\r\none who fasted, as he did, for devotion. \"Son,\" said the friar, \"these sins\r\nare natural and very trifling; and therefore I would not have thee burden\r\nthy conscience too much with them. There is no man, however holy he may be,\r\nbut must sometimes find it pleasant to eat after a long fast and to drink\r\nafter exertion.\" \"O, my father,\" said Ser Ciappelletto, \"say not this to\r\ncomfort me. You know well that I know, that the things which are done in the\r\nservice of God ought to be done in perfect purity of an unsullied spirit;\r\nand whoever does otherwise sins.\" The friar, well content, replied:--\"Glad I\r\nam that thou dost think so, and I am mightily pleased with thy pure and good\r\nconscience which therein appears; but tell me: hast thou sinned by avarice,\r\ncoveting more than was reasonable, or withholding more than was right? My\r\nfather,\" replied Ser Ciappelletto, \"I would not have you disquiet yourself,\r\nbecause I am in the house of these usurers: no part have I in their\r\nconcerns; nay, I did but come here to admonish and reprehend them, and wean\r\nthem from this abominable traffic; and so, I believe, I had done, had not\r\nGod sent me this visitation. But you must know, that my father left me a\r\nfortune, of which I dedicated the greater part to God; and since then for my\r\nown support and the relief of Christ's poor I have done a little trading,\r\nwhereof I have desired to make gain; and all that I have gotten I have\r\nshared with God's poor, reserving one half for my own needs and giving the\r\nother half to them; and so well has my Maker prospered me, that I have ever\r\nmanaged my affairs to better and better account.\" \"Well, done,\" said the\r\nfriar, \"but how? hast thou often given way to anger?\" \"Often indeed, I\r\nassure you,\" said Ser Ciappelletto. \"And who could refrain therefrom, seeing\r\nmen doing frowardly all day long, breaking the commandments of God and\r\nrecking nought of His judgments? Many a time in the course of a single day I\r\nhad rather be dead than alive, to see the young men going after vanity,\r\nswearing and forswearing themselves, haunting taverns, avoiding the\r\nchurches, and in short walking in the way of the world rather than in God's\r\nway.\" \"My son,\" said the friar, \"this is a righteous wrath; nor could I find\r\noccasion therein to lay a penance upon thee. But did anger ever by any\r\nchance betray thee into taking human life, or affronting or otherwise\r\nwronging any?\" \"Alas,\" replied Ser Ciappelletto, \"alas, sir, man of God\r\nthough you seem to me, how come you to speak after this manner? If I had had\r\nso much as the least thought of doing any of the things of which you speak,\r\nshould I believe, think you, that I had been thus supported of God? These\r\nare the deeds of robbers and such like evil men, to whom I have ever said,\r\nwhen any I saw:--'Go, God change your heart.'\" Said then the friar:--\"Now,\r\nmy son, as thou hopest to be blest of God, tell me, hast thou never borne\r\nfalse witness against any, or spoken evil of another, or taken the goods of\r\nanother without his leave?\" \"Yes, master friar,\" answered Ser Ciappelletto,\r\n\"most true it is that I have spoken evil of another; for I had once a\r\nneighbour who without the least excuse in the world was ever beating his\r\nwife, and so great was my pity of the poor creature, whom, when he was in\r\nhis cups, he would thrash as God alone knows how, that once I spoke evil of\r\nhim to his wife's kinsfolk.\" \"Well, well,\" said the friar, \"thou tellest me\r\nthou hast been a merchant; hast thou ever cheated any, as merchants use to\r\ndo?\" \"I'faith, yes, master friar,\" said Ser Ciappelletto; \"but I know not\r\nwho he was; only that he brought me some money which he owed me for some\r\ncloth that I had sold him, and I put it in a box without counting it, where\r\na month afterwards I found four farthings more than there should have been,\r\nwhich I kept for a year to return to him, but not seeing him again, I\r\nbestowed them in alms for the love of God.\" \"This,\" said the friar, \"was a\r\nsmall matter; and thou didst well to bestow them as thou didst.\" The holy\r\nfriar went on to ask him many other questions, to which he made answer in\r\neach case in this sort. Then, as the friar was about to give him absolution,\r\nSer Ciappelletto interposed:--\"Sir, I have yet a sin to confess.\" \"What?\"\r\nasked the friar. \"I remember,\" he said, \"that I once caused my servant to\r\nsweep my house on a Saturday after none; and that my observance of Sunday\r\nwas less devout than it should have been.\" \"O, my son,\" said the friar,\r\n\"this is a light matter.\" \"No,\" said Ser Ciappelletto, \"say not a light\r\nmatter; for Sunday is the more to be had in honour because on that day our\r\nLord rose from the dead.\" Then said the holy friar:--\"Now is there aught\r\nelse that thou hast done?\" \"Yes, master friar,\" replied Ser Ciappelletto,\r\n\"once by inadvertence I spat in the church of God.\" At this the friar began\r\nto smile, and said:--\"My son, this is not a matter to trouble about; we, who\r\nare religious, spit there all day long.\" \"And great impiety it is when you\r\nso do,\" replied Ser Ciappelletto, \"for there is nothing that is so worthy to\r\nbe kept from all impurity as the holy temple in which sacrifice is offered\r\nto God.\" More he said in the same strain, which I pass over; and then at\r\nlast he began to sigh, and by and by to weep bitterly, as he was well able\r\nto do when he chose. And the friar demanding:--\"My son, why weepest thou?\"\r\n\"Alas, master friar\" answered Ser Ciappelletto, \"a sin yet remains, which I\r\nhave never confessed, such shame were it to me to tell it; and as often as I\r\ncall it to mind, I weep as you now see me weep, being well assured that God\r\nwill never forgive me this sin.\" Then said the holy friar:--\"Come, come,\r\nson, what is this that thou sayst? If all the sins of all the men, that ever\r\nwere or ever shall be, as long as the world shall endure, were concentrated\r\nin one man, so great is the goodness of God that He would freely pardon them\r\nall, were he but penitent and contrite as I see thou art, and confessed\r\nthem: wherefore tell me thy sin with a good courage.\" Then said Ser\r\nCiappelletto, still weeping bitterly:--\"Alas, my father, mine is too great a\r\nsin, and scarce can I believe, if your prayers do not co-operate, that God\r\nwill ever grant me His pardon thereof.\" \"Tell it with a good courage,\" said\r\nthe friar; \"I promise thee to pray God for thee.\" Ser Ciappelletto, however,\r\ncontinued to weep, and would not speak, for all the friar's encouragement.\r\nWhen he had kept him for a good while in suspense, he heaved a mighty sigh,\r\nand said:--\"My father, as you promise me to pray God for me, I will tell it\r\nyou. Know, then, that once, when I was a little child, I cursed my mother;\"\r\nand having so said he began again to weep bitterly. \"O, my son,\" said the\r\nfriar, \"does this seem to thee so great a sin? Men curse God all day long,\r\nand he pardons them freely, if they repent them of having so done; and\r\nthinkest thou he will not pardon thee this? Weep not, be comforted, for\r\ntruly, hadst thou been one of them that set Him on the Cross, with the\r\ncontrition that I see in thee, thou wouldst not fail of His pardon.\" \"Alas!\r\nmy father,\" rejoined Ser Ciappelletto, \"what is this you say? To curse my\r\nsweet mother that carried me in her womb for nine months day and night, and\r\nafterwards on her shoulder more than a hundred times! Heinous indeed was my\r\noffence; 'tis too great a sin; nor will it be pardoned, unless you pray God\r\nfor me.\"\r\n\r\nThe friar now perceiving that Ser Ciappelletto had nothing more to say, gave\r\nhim absolution and his blessing, reputing him for a most holy man, fully\r\nbelieving that all that he had said was true. And who would not have so\r\nbelieved, hearing him so speak at the point of death? Then, when all was\r\ndone, he said:--\"Ser Ciappelletto, if God so will, you will soon be well;\r\nbut should it so come to pass that God call your blessed soul to Himself in\r\nthis state of grace, is it well pleasing to you that your body be buried in\r\nour convent?\" \"Yea, verily, master friar,\" replied Ser Ciappelletto; \"there\r\nwould I be, and nowhere else, since you have promised to pray God for me;\r\nbesides which I have ever had a special devotion to your order. Wherefore I\r\npray you, that, on your return to your convent, you cause to be sent me that\r\nvery Body of Christ, which you consecrate in the morning on the altar;\r\nbecause (unworthy though I be) I purpose with your leave to take it, and\r\nafterwards the holy and extreme unction, that, though I have lived as a\r\nsinner, I may die at any rate as a Christian.\" The holy man said that he was\r\ngreatly delighted, that it was well said of Ser Ciappelletto, and that he\r\nwould cause the Host to be forthwith brought to him; and so it was.\r\n\r\nThe two brothers, who much misdoubted Ser Ciappelletto's power to deceive\r\nthe friar, had taken their stand on the other side of a wooden partition\r\nwhich divided the room in which Ser Ciappelletto lay from another, and\r\nhearkening there they readily heard and understood what Ser Ciappelletto\r\nsaid to the friar; and at times could scarce refrain their laughter as they\r\nfollowed his confession; and now and again they said one to another:--\"What\r\nmanner of man is this, whom neither age nor sickness, nor fear of death, on\r\nthe threshold of which he now stands, nor yet of God, before whose\r\njudgment-seat he must soon appear, has been able to turn from his wicked\r\nways, that he die not even as he has lived?\" But seeing that his confession\r\nhad secured the interment of his body in church, they troubled themselves no\r\nfurther. Ser Ciappelletto soon afterwards communicated, and growing\r\nimmensely worse, received the extreme unction, and died shortly after\r\nvespers on the same day on which he had made his good confession. So the two\r\nbrothers, having from his own moneys provided the wherewith to procure him\r\nhonourable sepulture, and sent word to the friars to come at even to observe\r\nthe usual vigil, and in the morning to fetch the corpse, set all things in\r\norder accordingly. The holy friar who had confessed him, hearing that he was\r\ndead, had audience of the prior of the friary; a chapter was convened and\r\nthe assembled brothers heard from the confessor's own mouth how Ser\r\nCiappelletto had been a holy man, as had appeared by his confession, and\r\nwere exhorted to receive the body with the utmost veneration and pious care,\r\nas one by which there was good hope that God would work many miracles. To\r\nthis the prior and the rest of the credulous confraternity assenting, they\r\nwent in a body in the evening to the place where the corpse of Ser\r\nCiappelletto lay, and kept a great and solemn vigil over it; and in the\r\nmorning they made a procession habited in their surplices and copes with\r\nbooks in their hands and crosses in front; and chanting as they went, they\r\nfetched the corpse and brought it back to their church with the utmost pomp\r\nand solemnity, being followed by almost all the folk of the city, men and\r\nwomen alike. So it was laid in the church, and then the holy friar who had\r\nheard the confession got up in the pulpit and began to preach marvellous\r\nthings of Ser Ciapelletto's life, his fasts, his virginity, his simplicity\r\nand guilelessness and holiness; narrating among the other matters that of\r\nwhich Ser Ciappelletto had made tearful confession as his greatest sin, and\r\nhow he had hardly been able to make him conceive that God would pardon him;\r\nfrom which he took occasion to reprove his hearers; saying:--\"And you,\r\naccursed of God, on the least pretext, blaspheme God and His Mother, and all\r\nthe celestial court. And much beside he told of his loyalty and purity; and,\r\nin short, so wrought upon the people by his words, to which they gave entire\r\ncredence, that they all conceived a great veneration for Ser Ciappelletto,\r\nand at the close of the office came pressing forward with the utmost\r\nvehemence to kiss the feet and the hands of the corpse, from which they tore\r\noff the cerements, each thinking himself blessed to have but a scrap thereof\r\nin his possession; and so it was arranged that it should be kept there all\r\nday long, so as to be visible and accessible to all. At nightfall it was\r\nhonourably interred in a marble tomb in one of the chapels, where on the\r\nmorrow, one by one, folk came and lit tapers and prayed and paid their vows,\r\nsetting there the waxen images which they had dedicated. And the fame of\r\nCiappelletto's holiness and the devotion to him grew in such measure that\r\nscarce any there was that in any adversity would vow aught to any saint but\r\nhe, and they called him and still call him San Ciappelletto affirming that\r\nmany miracles have been and daily are wrought by God through him for such as\r\ndevoutly crave his intercession.\r\n\r\nSo lived, so died Ser Cepperello da Prato, and came to be reputed a saint,\r\nas you have heard. Nor would I deny that it is possible that he is of the\r\nnumber of the blessed in the presence of God, seeing that, though his life\r\nwas evil and depraved, yet he might in his last moments have made so\r\ncomplete an act of contrition that perchance God had mercy on him and\r\nreceived him into His kingdom. But, as this is hidden from us, I speak\r\naccording to that which appears, and I say that he ought rather to be in the\r\nhands of the devil in hell than in Paradise. Which, if so it be, is a\r\nmanifest token of the superabundance of the goodness of God to usward,\r\ninasmuch as he regards not our error but the sincerity of our faith, and\r\nhearkens unto us when, mistaking one who is at enmity with Him for a friend,\r\nwe have recourse to him, as to one holy indeed, as our intercessor for His\r\ngrace. Wherefore, that we of this gay company may by His grace be preserved\r\nsafe and sound throughout this time of adversity, commend we ourselves in\r\nour need to Him, whose name we began by invoking, with lauds and reverent\r\ndevotion and good confidence that we shall be heard.\r\n\r\nAnd so he was silent.\r\n\r\n(1) The diminutive of ceppo, stump or log: more commonly written cepperello\r\n(cf. p. 32) or ceppatello. The form ciapperello seems to be found only here.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL II.\r\n\r\n--\r\nAbraham, a Jew, at the instance of Jehannot de Chevigny, goes to the court\r\nof Rome, and having marked the evil life of the clergy, returns to Paris,\r\nand becomes a Christian.\r\n--\r\n\r\nPamfilo's story elicited the mirth of some of the ladies and the hearty\r\ncommendation of all, who listened to it with close attention until the end.\r\nWhereupon the queen bade Neifile, who sat next her, to tell a story, that\r\nthe commencement thus made of their diversions might have its sequel.\r\nNeifile, whose graces of mind matched the beauty of her person, consented\r\nwith a gladsome goodwill, and thus began:--\r\n\r\nPamfilo has shewn by his story that the goodness of God spares to regard our\r\nerrors when they result from unavoidable ignorance, and in mine I mean to\r\nshew you how the same goodness, bearing patiently with the shortcomings of\r\nthose who should be its faithful witness in deed and word, draws from them\r\ncontrariwise evidence of His infallible truth; to the end that what we\r\nbelieve we may with more assured conviction follow.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, gracious ladies, as I have heard tell, there was once a great\r\nmerchant, a large dealer in drapery, a good man, most loyal and righteous,\r\nhis name Jehannot de Chevigny, between whom and a Jew, Abraham by name, also\r\na merchant, and a man of great wealth, as also most loyal and righteous,\r\nthere subsisted a very close friendship. Now Jehannot, observing Abraham's\r\nloyalty and rectitude, began to be sorely vexed in spirit that the soul of\r\none so worthy and wise and good should perish for want of faith. Wherefore\r\nhe began in a friendly manner to plead with him, that he should leave the\r\nerrors of the Jewish faith and turn to the Christian verity, which, being\r\nsound and holy, he might see daily prospering and gaining ground, whereas,\r\non the contrary, his own religion was dwindling and was almost come to\r\nnothing. The Jew replied that he believed that there was no faith sound and\r\nholy except the Jewish faith, in which he was born, and in which he meant to\r\nlive and die; nor would anything ever turn him therefrom. Nothing daunted,\r\nhowever, Jehannot some days afterwards began again to ply Abraham with\r\nsimilar arguments, explaining to him in such crude fashion as merchants use\r\nthe reasons why our faith is better than the Jewish. And though the Jew was\r\na great master in the Jewish law, yet, whether it was by reason of his\r\nfriendship for Jehannot, or that the Holy Spirit dictated the words that the\r\nsimple merchant used, at any rate the Jew began to be much interested in\r\nJehannot's arguments, though still too staunch in his faith to suffer\r\nhimself to be converted. But Jehannot was no less assiduous in plying him\r\nwith argument than he was obstinate in adhering to his law, insomuch that at\r\nlength the Jew, overcome by such incessant appeals, said:--\"Well, well,\r\nJehannot, thou wouldst have me become a Christian, and I am disposed to do\r\nso, provided I first go to Rome and there see him whom thou callest God's\r\nvicar on earth, and observe what manner of life he leads and his brother\r\ncardinals with him; and if such it be that thereby, in conjunction with thy\r\nwords, I may understand that thy faith is better than mine, as thou hast\r\nsought to shew me, I will do as I have said: otherwise, I will remain as I\r\nam a Jew.\" When Jehannot heard this, he was greatly distressed, saying to\r\nhimself:--\"I thought to have converted him; but now I see that the pains\r\nwhich I took for so excellent a purpose are all in vain; for, if he goes to\r\nthe court of Rome and sees the iniquitous and foul life which the clergy\r\nlead there, so far from turning Christian, had he been converted already, he\r\nwould without doubt relapse into Judaism.\" Then turning to Abraham he said:-\r\n-\"Nay, but, my friend, why wouldst thou be at all this labour and great\r\nexpense of travelling from here to Rome? to say nothing of the risks both by\r\nsea and by land which a rich man like thee must needs run. Thinkest thou\r\nnot, to find here one that can give thee baptism? And as for any doubts that\r\nthou mayst have touching the faith to which I point thee, where wilt thou\r\nfind greater masters and sages therein than here, to resolve thee of any\r\nquestion thou mayst put to them? Wherefore in my opinion this journey of\r\nthine is superfluous. Think that the prelates there are such as thou mayst\r\nhave seen here, nay, as much better as they are nearer to the Chief Pastor.\r\nAnd so, by my advice thou wilt spare thy pains until some time of\r\nindulgence, when I, perhaps, may be able to bear thee company.\" The Jew\r\nreplied:--\"Jehannot, I doubt not that so it is as thou sayst; but once and\r\nfor all I tell thee that I am minded to go there, and will never otherwise\r\ndo that which thou wouldst have me and hast so earnestly besought me to do.\"\r\n\"Go then,\" said Jehannot, seeing that his mind was made up, \"and good luck\r\ngo with thee;\" and so he gave up the contest because nothing would be lost,\r\nthough he felt sure that he would never become a Christian after seeing the\r\ncourt of Rome. The Jew took horse, and posted with all possible speed to\r\nRome; where on his arrival he was honourably received by his fellow Jews. He\r\nsaid nothing to any one of the purpose for which he had come; but began\r\ncircumspectly to acquaint himself with the ways of the Pope and the\r\ncardinals and the other prelates and all the courtiers; and from what he saw\r\nfor himself, being a man of great intelligence, or learned from others, he\r\ndiscovered that without distinction of rank they were all sunk in the most\r\ndisgraceful lewdness, sinning not only in the way of nature but after the\r\nmanner of the men of Sodom, without any restraint of remorse or shame, in\r\nsuch sort that, when any great favour was to be procured, the influence of\r\nthe courtesans and boys was of no small moment. Moreover he found them one\r\nand all gluttonous, wine-bibbers, drunkards, and next after lewdness, most\r\naddicted to the shameless service of the belly, like brute beasts. And, as\r\nhe probed the matter still further, he perceived that they were all so\r\ngreedy and avaricious that human, nay Christian blood, and things sacred of\r\nwhat kind soever, spiritualities no less than temporalities, they bought and\r\nsold for money; which traffic was greater and employed more brokers than the\r\ndrapery trade and all the other trades of Paris put together; open simony\r\nand gluttonous excess being glosed under such specious terms as\r\n\"arrangement\" and \"moderate use of creature comforts,\" as if God could not\r\npenetrate the thoughts of even the most corrupt hearts, to say nothing of\r\nthe signification of words, and would suffer Himself to be misled after the\r\nmanner of men by the names of things. Which matters, with many others which\r\nare not to be mentioned, our modest and sober-minded Jew found by no means\r\nto his liking, so that, his curiosity being fully satisfied, he was minded\r\nto return to Paris; which accordingly he did. There, on his arrival, he was\r\nmet by Jehannot; and the two made great cheer together. Jehannot expected\r\nAbraham's conversion least of all things, and allowed him some days of rest\r\nbefore he asked what he thought of the Holy Father and the cardinals and the\r\nother courtiers. To which the Jew forthwith replied:--\"I think God owes them\r\nall an evil recompense: I tell thee, so far as I was able to carry my\r\ninvestigations, holiness, devotion, good works or exemplary living in any\r\nkind was nowhere to be found in any clerk; but only lewdness, avarice,\r\ngluttony, and the like, and worse, if worse may be, appeared to be held in\r\nsuch honour of all, that (to my thinking) the place is a centre of\r\ndiabolical rather than of divine activities. To the best of my judgment,\r\nyour Pastor, and by consequence all that are about him devote all their zeal\r\nand ingenuity and subtlety to devise how best and most speedily they may\r\nbring the Christian religion to nought and banish it from the world. And\r\nbecause I see that what they so zealously endeavour does not come to pass,\r\nbut that on the contrary your religion continually grows, and shines more\r\nand more clear, therein I seem to discern a very evident token that it,\r\nrather than any other, as being more true and holy than any other, has the\r\nHoly Spirit for its foundation and support. For which cause, whereas I met\r\nyour exhortations in a harsh and obdurate temper, and would not become a\r\nChristian, now I frankly tell you that I would on no account omit to become\r\nsuch. Go we then to the church, and there according to the traditional rite\r\nof your holy faith let me receive baptism.\" Jehannot, who had anticipated a\r\ndiametrically opposite conclusion, as soon as he heard him so speak, was the\r\nbest pleased man that ever was in the world. So taking Abraham with him to\r\nNotre Dame he prayed the clergy there to baptise him. When they heard that\r\nit was his own wish, they forthwith did so, and Jehannot raised him from the\r\nsacred font, and named him Jean; and afterwards he caused teachers of great\r\neminence thoroughly to instruct him in our faith, which he readily learned,\r\nand afterwards practised in a good, a virtuous, nay, a holy life.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL III.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMelchisedech, a Jew, by a story of three rings averts a great danger with\r\nwhich he was menaced by Saladin.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen Neifile had brought her story to a close amid the commendations of all\r\nthe company, Filomena, at the queen's behest, thus began:--\r\n\r\nThe story told by Neifile brings to my mind another in which also Jew\r\nappears, but this time as the hero of a perilous adventure; and as enough\r\nhas been said of God and of the truth our faith, it will not now be\r\ninopportune if we descend to mundane events and the actions of men.\r\nWherefore I propose to tell you a story, which will perhaps dispose you to\r\nbe more circumspect than you have been wont to be in answering questions\r\naddressed to you. Well ye know, or should know, loving gossips, that, as it\r\noften happens that folk by their own folly forfeit a happy estate and are\r\nplunged in most grievous misery, so good sense will extricate the wise from\r\nextremity of peril, and establish them in complete and assured peace. Of the\r\nchange from good to evil fortune, which folly may effect, instances abound;\r\nindeed, occurring as they do by the thousand day by day, they are so\r\nconspicuous that their recital would be beside our present purpose. But that\r\ngood sense may be our succour in misfortune, I will now, as I promised, make\r\nplain to you within the narrow compass of a little story.\r\n\r\nSaladin, who by his great valour had from small beginnings made himself\r\nSoldan of Egypt, and gained many victories over kings both Christian and\r\nSaracen, having in divers wars and by divers lavish displays of magnificence\r\nspent all his treasure, and in order to meet a certain emergency being in\r\nneed of a large sum of money, and being at a loss to raise it with a\r\ncelerity adequate to his necessity, bethought him of a wealthy Jew,\r\nMelchisedech by name, who lent at usance in Alexandria, and who, were he but\r\nwilling, was, as he believed, able to accommodate him, but was so miserly\r\nthat he would never do so of his own accord, nor was Saladin disposed to\r\nconstrain him thereto. So great, however, was his necessity that, after\r\npondering every method whereby the Jew might be induced to be compliant, at\r\nlast he determined to devise a colourably reasonable pretext for extorting\r\nthe money from him. So he sent for him, received him affably, seated him by\r\nhis side, and presently said to him:--\"My good man, I have heard from many\r\npeople that thou art very wise, and of great discernment in divine things;\r\nwherefore I would gladly know of thee, which of the three laws thou reputest\r\nthe true law, the law of the Jews, the law of the Saracens, or the law of\r\nthe Christians?\" The Jew, who was indeed a wise man, saw plainly enough that\r\nSaladin meant to entangle him in his speech, that he might have occasion to\r\nharass him, and bethought him that he could not praise any of the three laws\r\nabove another without furnishing Saladin with the pretext which he sought.\r\nSo, concentrating all the force of his mind to shape such an answer as might\r\navoid the snare, he presently lit on what he sought, saying:--\"My lord, a\r\npretty question indeed is this which you propound, and fain would I answer\r\nit; to which end it is apposite that I tell you a story, which, if you will\r\nhearken, is as follows:--If I mistake not, I remember to have often heard\r\ntell of a great and rich man of old time, who among other most precious\r\njewels had in his treasury a ring of extraordinary beauty and value, which\r\nby reason of its value and beauty he was minded to leave to his heirs for\r\never; for which cause he ordained, that, whichever of his sons was found in\r\npossession of the ring as by his bequest, should thereby be designate his\r\nheir, and be entitled to receive from the rest the honour and homage due to\r\na superior. The son, to whom he bequeathed the ring, left it in like manner\r\nto his descendants, making the like ordinance as his predecessor. In short\r\nthe ring passed from hand to hand for many generations; and in the end came\r\nto the hands of one who had three sons, goodly and virtuous all, and very\r\nobedient to their father, so that he loved them all indifferently. The rule\r\ntouching the descent of the ring was known to the young men, and each\r\naspiring to hold the place of honour among them did all he could to persuade\r\nhis father, who was now old, to leave the ring to him at his death. The\r\nworthy man, who loved them all equally, and knew not how to choose from\r\namong them a sole legatee, promised the ring to each in turn, and in order\r\nto satisfy all three, caused a cunning artificer secretly to make two other\r\nrings, so like the first, that the maker himself could hardly tell which was\r\nthe true ring. So, before he died, he disposed of the rings, giving one\r\nprivily to each of his sons; whereby it came to pass, that after his decease\r\neach of the sons claimed the inheritance and the place of honour, and, his\r\nclaim being disputed by his brothers, produced his ring in witness of right.\r\nAnd the rings being found so like one to another that it was impossible to\r\ndistinguish the true one, the suit to determine the true heir remained\r\npendent, and still so remains. And so, my lord, to your question, touching\r\nthe three laws given to the three peoples by God the Father, I answer:--Each\r\nof these peoples deems itself to have the true inheritance, the true law,\r\nthe true commandments of God; but which of them is justified in so\r\nbelieving, is a question which, like that of the rings, remains pendent.\"\r\nThe excellent adroitness with which the Jew had contrived to evade the snare\r\nwhich he had laid for his feet was not lost upon Saladin. He therefore\r\ndetermined to let the Jew know his need, and did so, telling him at the same\r\ntime what he had intended to do, in the event of his answering less\r\ncircumspectly than he had done.\r\n\r\nThereupon the Jew gave the Soldan all the accommodation that he required,\r\nwhich the Soldan afterwards repaid him in full. He also gave him most\r\nmunificent gifts with his lifelong amity and a great and honourable position\r\nnear his person.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL IV.\r\n\r\n--\r\nA monk lapses into a sin meriting the most severe punishment, justly\r\ncensures the same fault in his abbot, and thus evades the penalty.\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe silence which followed the conclusion of Filomena's tale was broken by\r\nDioneo, who sate next her, and without waiting for the queen's word, for he\r\nknew that by the rule laid down at the commencement it was now his turn to\r\nspeak, began on this wise:--Loving ladies, if I have well understood the\r\nintention of you all, we are here to afford entertainment to one another by\r\nstory-telling; wherefore, provided only nought is done that is repugnant to\r\nthis end, I deem it lawful for each (and so said our queen a little while\r\nago) to tell whatever story seems to him most likely to be amusing. Seeing,\r\nthen, that we have heard how Abraham saved his soul by the good counsel of\r\nJehannot de Chevigny, and Melchisedech by his own good sense safe-guarded\r\nhis wealth against the stratagems of Saladin, I hope to escape your censure\r\nin narrating a brief story of a monk, who by his address delivered his body\r\nfrom imminent peril of most severe chastisement.\r\n\r\nIn the not very remote district of Lunigiana there flourished formerly a\r\ncommunity of monks more numerous and holy than is there to be found to-day,\r\namong whom was a young brother, whose vigour and lustihood neither the fasts\r\nnor the vigils availed to subdue. One afternoon, while the rest of the\r\nconfraternity slept, our young monk took a stroll around the church, which\r\nlay in a very sequestered spot, and chanced to espy a young and very\r\nbeautiful girl, a daughter, perhaps, of one of the husbandmen of those\r\nparts, going through the fields and gathering herbs as she went. No sooner\r\nhad he seen her than he was sharply assailed by carnal concupiscence,\r\ninsomuch that he made up to and accosted her; and (she hearkening) little by\r\nlittle they came to an understanding, and unobserved by any entered his cell\r\ntogether. Now it so chanced that, while they fooled it within somewhat\r\nrecklessly, he being overwrought with passion, the abbot awoke and passing\r\nslowly by the young monk's cell, heard the noise which they made within, and\r\nthe better to distinguish the voices, came softly up to the door of the\r\ncell, and listening discovered that beyond all doubt there was a woman\r\nwithin. His first thought was to force the door open; but, changing his\r\nmind, he returned to his chamber and waited until the monk should come out.\r\n\r\nDelightsome beyond measure though the monk found his intercourse with the\r\ngirl, yet was he not altogether without anxiety. He had heard, as he\r\nthought, the sound of footsteps in the dormitory, and having applied his eye\r\nto a convenient aperture had had a good view of the abbot as he stood by the\r\ndoor listening. He was thus fully aware that the abbot might have detected\r\nthe presence of a woman in the cell. Whereat he was exceedingly distressed,\r\nknowing that he had a severe punishment to expect; but he concealed his\r\nvexation from the girl while he busily cast about in his mind for some way\r\nof escape from his embarrassment. He thus hit on a novel stratagem which was\r\nexactly suited to his purpose. With the air of one who had had enough of the\r\ngirl's company he said to her:--\"I shall now leave you in order that I may\r\narrange for your departure hence unobserved. Stay here quietly until I\r\nreturn.\" So out he went, locking the door of the cell, and withdrawing the\r\nkey, which he carried straight to the abbot's chamber and handed to him, as\r\nwas the custom when a monk was going out, saying with a composed air:--\"Sir,\r\nI was not able this morning to bring in all the faggots which I had made\r\nready, so with your leave I will go to the wood and bring them in.\" The\r\nabbot, desiring to have better cognisance of the monk's offence, and not\r\ndreaming that the monk knew that he had been detected, was pleased with the\r\nturn matters had taken, and received the key gladly, at the same time giving\r\nthe monk the desired leave. So the monk withdrew, and the abbot began to\r\nconsider what course it were best for him to take, whether to assemble the\r\nbrotherhood and open the door in their presence, that, being witnesses of\r\nthe delinquency, they might have no cause to murmur against him when he\r\nproceeded to punish the delinquent, or whether it were not better first to\r\nlearn from the girl's own lips how it had come about. And reflecting that\r\nshe might be the wife or daughter of some man who would take it ill that she\r\nshould be shamed by being exposed to the gaze of all the monks, he\r\ndetermined first of all to find out who she was, and then to make up his\r\nmind. So he went softly to the cell, opened the door, and, having entered,\r\nclosed it behind him. The girl, seeing that her visitor was none other than\r\nthe abbot, quite lost her presence of mind, and quaking with shame began to\r\nweep. Master abbot surveyed her from head to foot, and seeing that she was\r\nfresh and comely, fell a prey, old though he was, to fleshly cravings no\r\nless poignant and sudden than those which the young monk had experienced,\r\nand began thus to commune with himself:--\"Alas! why take I not my pleasure\r\nwhen I may, seeing that I never need lack for occasions of trouble and\r\nvexation of spirit? Here is a fair wench, and no one in the world to know.\r\nIf I can bring her to pleasure me, I know not why I should not do so. Who\r\nwill know? No one will ever know; and sin that is hidden is half forgiven;\r\nthis chance may never come again; so, methinks, it were the part of wisdom\r\nto take the boon which God bestows.\" So musing, with an altogether different\r\npurpose from that with which he had come, he drew near the girl, and softly\r\nbade her to be comforted, and besought her not to weep; and so little by\r\nlittle he came at last to show her what he would be at. The girl, being made\r\nneither of iron nor of adamant, was readily induced to gratify the abbot,\r\nwho after bestowing upon her many an embrace and kiss, got upon the monk's\r\nbed, where, being sensible, perhaps, of the disparity between his reverend\r\nportliness and her tender youth, and fearing to injure her by his excessive\r\nweight, he refrained from lying upon her, but laid her upon him, and in that\r\nmanner disported himself with her for a long time. The monk, who had only\r\npretended to go to the wood, and had concealed himself in the dormitory, no\r\nsooner saw the abbot enter his cell than he was overjoyed to think that his\r\nplan would succeed; and when he saw that he had locked the door, he was well\r\nassured thereof. So he stole out of his hiding-place, and set his eye to an\r\naperture through which he saw and heard all that the abbot did and said. At\r\nlength the abbot, having had enough of dalliance with the girl, locked her\r\nin the cell and returned to his chamber. Catching sight of the monk soon\r\nafterwards, and supposing him to have returned from the wood, he determined\r\nto give him a sharp reprimand and have him imprisoned, that he might thus\r\nsecure the prey for himself alone. He therefore caused him to be summoned,\r\nchid him very severely and with a stern countenance, and ordered him to be\r\nput in prison. The monk replied trippingly:--\"I Sir, I have not been so long\r\nin the order of St. Benedict as to have every particular of the rule by\r\nheart; nor did you teach me before to-day in what posture it behoves the\r\nmonk to have intercourse with women, but limited your instruction to such\r\nmatters as fasts and vigils. As, however, you have now given me my lesson, I\r\npromise you, if you also pardon my offence, that I will never repeat it, but\r\nwill always follow the example which you have set me.\"\r\n\r\nThe abbot, who was a shrewd man, saw at once that the monk was not only more\r\nknowing than he, but had actually seen what he had done; nor,\r\nconscience-stricken himself, could he for shame mete out to the monk a\r\nmeasure which he himself merited. So pardon given, with an injunction to\r\nbury what had been seen in silence, they decently conveyed the young girl\r\nout of the monastery, whither, it is to be believed, they now and again\r\ncaused her to return.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL V.\r\n\r\n--\r\nThe Marchioness of Monferrato by a banquet of hens seasoned with wit checks\r\nthe mad passion of the King of France.\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe story told by Dioneo evoked at first some qualms of shame in the minds\r\nof the ladies, as was apparent by the modest blush that tinged their faces:\r\nthen exchanging glances, and scarce able to refrain their mirth, they\r\nlistened to it with half-suppressed smiles. On its conclusion they bestowed\r\nupon Dioneo a few words of gentle reprehension with intent to admonish him\r\nthat such stories were not to be told among ladies. The queen then turned to\r\nFiammetta, who was seated on the grass at her side, and bade her follow suit\r\nand Fiammetta with a gay and gracious mien thus began:--\r\n\r\nThe line upon which our story-telling proceeds, to wit, to shew the virtue\r\nthat resides in apt and ready repartees, pleases me well; and as in affairs\r\nof love men and women are in diverse case, for to aspire to the love of a\r\nwoman of higher lineage than his own is wisdom in man, whereas a woman's\r\ngood sense is then most conspicuous when she knows how to preserve herself\r\nfrom becoming enamoured of a man, her superior in rank, I am minded, fair my\r\nladies, to shew you by the story which I am now to tell, how by deed and\r\nword a gentlewoman both defended herself against attack, and weaned her\r\nsuitor from his love.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Monferrato, a paladin of distinguished prowess, was gone\r\noverseas as gonfalonier of the Church in a general array of the Christian\r\nforces. Whose merits being canvassed at the court of Philippe le Borgne, on\r\nthe eve of his departure from France on the same service, a knight observed,\r\nthat there was not under the stars a couple comparable to the Marquis and\r\nhis lady; in that, while the Marquis was a paragon of the knightly virtues,\r\nhis lady for beauty, and honour was without a peer among all the other\r\nladies of the world. These words made so deep an impression on the mind of\r\nthe King of France that, though he had never seen the lady, he fell ardently\r\nin love with her, and, being to join the armada, resolved that his port of\r\nembarcation should be no other than Genoa, in order that, travelling thither\r\nby land, he might find a decent pretext for visiting the Marchioness, with\r\nwhom in the absence of the Marquis he trusted to have the success which he\r\ndesired; nor did he fail to put his design in execution. Having sent his\r\nmain army on before, he took the road himself with a small company of\r\ngentlemen, and, as they approached the territory of the Marquis, he\r\ndespatched a courier to the Marchioness, a day in advance, to let her know\r\nthat he expected to breakfast with her the next morning. The lady, who knew\r\nher part and played it well, replied graciously, that he would be indeed\r\nwelcome, and that his presence would be the greatest of all favours. She\r\nthen began to commune with herself, what this might import, that so great a\r\nking should come to visit her in her husband's absence, nor was she so\r\ndeluded as not to surmise that it was the fame of her beauty that drew him\r\nthither. Nevertheless she made ready to do him honour in a manner befitting\r\nher high degree, summoning to her presence such of the retainers as remained\r\nin the castle, and giving all needful directions with their advice, except\r\nthat the order of the banquet and the choice of the dishes she reserved\r\nentirely to herself. Then, having caused all the hens that could be found in\r\nthe country-side to be brought with all speed into the castle, she bade her\r\ncooks furnish forth the royal table with divers dishes made exclusively of\r\nsuch fare. The King arrived on the appointed day, and was received by the\r\nlady with great and ceremonious cheer. Fair and noble and gracious seemed\r\nshe in the eyes of the King beyond all that he had conceived from the\r\nknight's words, so that he was lost in admiration and inly extolled her to\r\nthe skies, his passion being the more inflamed in proportion as he found the\r\nlady surpass the idea which he had formed of her. A suite of rooms furnished\r\nwith all the appointments befitting the reception of so great a king, was\r\nplaced at his disposal, and after a little rest, breakfast-time being come,\r\nhe and the Marchioness took their places at the same table, while his suite\r\nwere honourably entertained at other boards according to their several\r\nqualities. Many courses were served with no lack of excellent and rare\r\nwines, whereby the King was mightily pleased, as also by the extraordinary\r\nbeauty of the Marchioness, on whom his eye from time to time rested.\r\nHowever, as course followed course, the King observed with some surprise,\r\nthat, though the dishes were diverse, yet they were all but variations of\r\none and the same fare, to wit, the pullet. Besides which he knew that the\r\ndomain was one which could not but afford plenty of divers sorts of game,\r\nand by forewarning the lady of his approach, he had allowed time for\r\nhunting; yet, for all his surprise, he would not broach the question more\r\ndirectly with her than by a reference to her hens; so, turning to her with a\r\nsmile, he said:--\"Madam, do hens grow in this country without so much as a\r\nsingle cock?\" The Marchioness, who perfectly apprehended the drift of the\r\nquestion, saw in it an opportunity, sent her by God, of evincing her\r\nvirtuous resolution; so casting a haughty glance upon the King she answered\r\nthus:--\"Sire, no; but the women, though they may differ somewhat from others\r\nin dress and rank, are yet of the same nature here as elsewhere.\" The\r\nsignificance of the banquet of pullets was made manifest to the King by\r\nthese words, as also the virtue which they veiled. He perceived that on a\r\nlady of such a temper words would be wasted, and that force was out of the\r\nquestion. Wherefore, yielding to the dictates of prudence and honour, he was\r\nnow as prompt to quench, as he had been inconsiderate in conceiving, his\r\nunfortunate passion for the lady; and fearing her answers, he refrained from\r\nfurther jesting with her, and dismissing his hopes devoted himself to his\r\nbreakfast, which done, he disarmed suspicion of the dishonourable purpose of\r\nhis visit by an early departure, and thanking her for the honour she had\r\nconferred upon him, and commending her to God, took the road to Genoa.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VI.\r\n\r\n--\r\nA worthy man by an apt saying puts to shame the wicked hypocrisy of the\r\nreligious.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen all had commended the virtue of the Marchioness and the spirited\r\nreproof which she administered to the King of France, Emilia, who sate next\r\nto Fiammetta, obeyed the queen's behest, and with a good courage thus\r\nbegan:--\r\n\r\nMy story is also of a reproof, but of one administered by a worthy man, who\r\nlived the secular life, to a greedy religious, by a jibe as merry as\r\nadmirable. Know then, dear ladies, that there was in our city, not long ago,\r\na friar minor, an inquisitor in matters of heresy, who, albeit he strove\r\nmight and main to pass himself off as a holy man and tenderly solicitous for\r\nthe integrity of the Christian Faith, as they all do, yet he had as keen a\r\nscent for a full purse as for a deficiency of faith. Now it so chanced that\r\nhis zeal was rewarded by the discovery of a good man far better furnished\r\nwith money than with sense, who in an unguarded moment, not from defect of\r\nfaith, but rather, perhaps from excess of hilarity, being heated with wine,\r\nhad happened to say to his boon companions, that he had a wine good enough\r\nfor Christ Himself to drink. Which being reported to the inquisitor, he,\r\nknowing the man to be possessed of large estates and a well-lined purse, set\r\nto work in hot haste, \"cum gladiis et fustibus,\" to bring all the rigour of\r\nthe law to bear upon him, designing thereby not to lighten the load of his\r\nvictim's misbelief, but to increase the weight of his own purse by the\r\nflorins, which he might, as he did, receive from him. So he cited him to his\r\npresence, and asked him whether what was alleged against him were true. The\r\ngood man answered in the affirmative, and told him how it had happened.\r\n\"Then,\" said our most holy and devout inquisitor of St. John Goldenbeard,\r\n(1) \"then hast thou made Christ a wine-bibber, and a lover of rare vintages,\r\nas if he were a sot, a toper and a tavern-haunter even as one of you. And\r\nthinkest thou now by a few words of apology to pass this off as a light\r\nmatter? It is no such thing as thou supposest. Thou hast deserved the fire;\r\nand we should but do our duty, did we inflict it upon thee.\" With these and\r\nthe like words in plenty he upbraided him, bending on him meanwhile a\r\ncountenance as stern as if Epicurus had stood before him denying the\r\nimmortality of the soul. In short he so terrified him that the good man was\r\nfain to employ certain intermediaries to anoint his palms with a liberal\r\nallowance of St. John Goldenmouth's grease, an excellent remedy for the\r\ndisease of avarice which spreads like a pestilence among the clergy, and\r\nnotably among the friars minors, who dare not touch a coin, that he might\r\ndeal gently with him. And great being the virtue of this ointment, albeit no\r\nmention is made thereof by Galen in any part of his Medicines, it had so\r\ngracious an effect that the threatened fire gave place to a cross, which he\r\nwas to wear as if he were bound for the emprise over seas; and to make the\r\nensign more handsome the inquisitor ordered that it should be yellow upon a\r\nblack ground. Besides which, after pocketing the coin, he kept him dangling\r\nabout him for some days, bidding him by way of penance hear mass every\r\nmorning at Santa Croce, and afterwards wait upon him at the breakfast-hour,\r\nafter which he was free to do as he pleased for the rest of the day. All\r\nwhich he most carefully observed; and so it fell out that one of these\r\nmornings there were chanted at the mass at which he assisted the following\r\nwords of the Gospel:--You shall receive an hundredfold and shall possess\r\neternal life. With these words deeply graven in his memory, he presented\r\nhimself, as he was bidden, before the inquisitor, where he sate taking his\r\nbreakfast, and being asked whether he had heard mass that morning, he\r\npromptly answered:--\"Yes, sir.\" And being further asked:--\"Heardest thou\r\naught therein, as to which thou art in doubt, or hast thou any question to\r\npropound?\" the good man responded:--\"Nay indeed, doubt have I none of aught\r\nthat I heard; but rather assured faith in the verity of all. One thing,\r\nhowever, I heard, which caused me to commiserate you and the rest of you\r\nfriars very heartily, in regard of the evil plight in which you must find\r\nyourselves in the other world.\" \"And what,\" said the inquisitor, \"was the\r\npassage that so moved thee to commiserate us?\" \"Sir,\" rejoined the good man,\r\n\"it was that passage in the Gospel which says:--\"You shall receive an\r\nhundredfold.\" \"You heard aright,\" said the inquisitor; \"but why did the\r\npassage so affect you?\" \"Sir,\" replied the good man, \"I will tell you. Since\r\nI have been in attendance here, I have seen a crowd of poor folk receive a\r\ndaily dole, now of one, now of two, huge tureens of swill, being the refuse\r\nfrom your table, and that of the brothers of this convent; whereof if you\r\nare to receive an hundredfold in the other world, you will have so much that\r\nit will go hard but you are all drowned therein.\" This raised a general\r\nlaugh among those who sat at the inquisitor's table, whereat the inquisitor,\r\nfeeling that their gluttony and hypocrisy had received a home-thrust, was\r\nvery wroth, and, but that what he had already done had not escaped censure,\r\nwould have instituted fresh proceedings against him in revenge for the\r\npleasantry with which he had rebuked the baseness of himself and his brother\r\nfriars; so in impotent wrath he bade him go about his business and shew\r\nhimself there no more.\r\n\r\n(1) The fiorino d'oro bore the effigy of St. John.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VII.\r\n\r\n--\r\nBergamino, with a story of Primasso and the Abbot of Cluny, finely censures\r\na sudden access of avarice in Messer Cane della Scala.\r\n--\r\n\r\nEmilia's charming manner and her story drew laughter and commendation from\r\nthe queen and all the company, who were much tickled by her new type of\r\ncrusader. When the laughter had subsided, and all were again silent,\r\nFilostrato, on whom the narration now fell, began on this wise:--\r\n\r\nA fine thing it is, noble ladies, to hit a fixed mark; but if, on the sudden\r\nappearance of some strange object, it be forthwith hit by the bowman, 'tis\r\nlittle short of a miracle. The corrupt and filthy life of the clergy offers\r\non many sides a fixed mark of iniquity at which, whoever is so minded, may\r\nlet fly, with little doubt that they will reach it, the winged words of\r\nreproof and reprehension. Wherefore, though the worthy man did well to\r\ncensure in the person of the inquisitor the pretended charity of the friars\r\nwho give to the poor what they ought rather to give to the pigs or throw\r\naway, higher indeed is the praise which I accord to him, of whom, taking my\r\ncue from the last story, I mean to speak; seeing that by a clever apologue\r\nhe rebuked a sudden and unwonted access of avarice in Messer Cane della\r\nScala, conveying in a figure what he had at heart to say touching Messer\r\nCane and himself; which apologue is to follow.\r\n\r\nFar and wide, almost to the ends of the earth, is borne the most illustrious\r\nrenown of Messer Cane della Scala, in many ways the favoured child of\r\nfortune, a lord almost without a peer among the notables and magnificoes of\r\nItaly since the time of the Emperor Frederic II. Now Messer Cane, being\r\nminded to hold high festival at Verona, whereof fame should speak marvellous\r\nthings, and many folk from divers parts, of whom the greater number were\r\njesters of every order, being already arrived, Messer Cane did suddenly (for\r\nsome cause or another) abandon his design, and dismissed them with a partial\r\nrecompense. One only, Bergamino by name, a speaker ready and polished in a\r\ndegree credible only to such as heard him, remained, having received no\r\nrecompense or conge, still cherishing the hope that this omission might yet\r\nturn out to his advantage. But Messer Cane was possessed with the idea that\r\nwhatever he might give Bergamino would be far more completely thrown away\r\nthan if he had tossed it into the fire; so never a word of the sort said he\r\nor sent he to him. A few days thus passed, and then Bergamino, seeing that\r\nhe was in no demand or request for aught that belonged to his office, and\r\nbeing also at heavy charges at his inn for the keep of his horses and\r\nservants, fell into a sort of melancholy; but still he waited a while, not\r\ndeeming it expedient to leave. He had brought with him three rich and goodly\r\nrobes, given him by other lords, that he might make a brave show at the\r\nfestival, and when his host began to press for payment he gave him one of\r\nthe robes; afterwards, there being still much outstanding against him, he\r\nmust needs, if he would tarry longer at the inn, give the host the second\r\nrobe; after which he began to live on the third, being minded remain there,\r\nas long as it would hold out, in expectation of better luck, and then to\r\ntake his departure. Now, while he was thus living on the third robe, it\r\nchanced that Messer Cane encountered him one day as he sate at breakfast\r\nwith a very melancholy visage. Which Messer Cane observing, said, rather to\r\ntease him than expecting to elicit from him any pleasant retort:--\"What ails\r\nthee, Bergamino, that thou art still so melancholy? Let me know the reason\r\nwhy.\" Whereupon Bergamino, without a moment's reflection, told the following\r\nstory, which could not have fitted his own case more exactly if it had been\r\nlong premeditated.\r\n\r\nMy lord, you must know that Primasso was a grammarian of great eminence, and\r\nexcellent and quick beyond all others in versifying; whereby he waxed so\r\nnotable and famous that, albeit he was not everywhere known by sight, yet\r\nthere were scarce any that did not at least by name and report know who\r\nPrimasso was. Now it so happened that, being once at Paris in straitened\r\ncircumstances, as it was his lot to be most of his time by reason that\r\nvirtue is little appreciated by the powerful, he heard speak of the Abbot of\r\nCluny, who, except the Pope, is supposed to be the richest prelate, in\r\nregard of his vast revenues, that the Church of God can shew; and marvellous\r\nand magnificent things were told him of the perpetual court which the abbot\r\nkept, and how, wherever he was, he denied not to any that came there either\r\nmeat or drink, so only that he preferred his request while the abbot was at\r\ntable. Which when Primasso heard, he determined to go and see for himself\r\nwhat magnificent state this abbot kept, for he was one that took great\r\ndelight in observing the ways of powerful and lordly men; wherefore he asked\r\nhow far from Paris was the abbot then sojourning. He was informed that the\r\nabbot was then at one of his places distant perhaps six miles; which\r\nPrimasso concluded he could reach in time for breakfast, if he started early\r\nin the morning. When he had learned the way, he found that no one else was\r\ntravelling by it, and fearing lest by mischance he should lose it, and so\r\nfind himself where it would not be easy for him to get food, he determined\r\nto obviate so disagreeable a contingency by taking with him three loaves of\r\nbread--as for drink, water, though not much to his taste, was, he supposed,\r\nto be found everywhere. So, having disposed the loaves in the fold of his\r\ntunic, he took the road and made such progress that he reached the abbot's\r\nplace of sojourn before the breakfast-hour. Having entered, he made the\r\ncircuit of the entire place, observing everything, the vast array of tables,\r\nand the vast kitchen well-appointed with all things needful for the\r\npreparation and service of the breakfast, and saying to himself:--\"In very\r\ntruth this man is even such a magnifico as he is reported to be.\" While his\r\nattention was thus occupied, the abbot's seneschal, it being now\r\nbreakfast-time, gave order to serve water for the hands, which being washen,\r\nthey sat them all down to breakfast. Now it so happened that Primasso was\r\nplaced immediately in front of the door by which the abbot must pass from\r\nhis chamber, into the hall, in which, according to rule of his court,\r\nneither wine, nor bread, nor aught else drinkable or eatable was ever set on\r\nthe tables before he made his appearance and was seated. The seneschal,\r\ntherefore, having set the tables, sent word to the abbot, that all was now\r\nready, and they waited only his pleasure. So the abbot gave the word, the\r\ndoor of his chamber was thrown open, and he took a step or two forward\r\ntowards the hall, gazing straight in front of him as he went. Thus it fell\r\nout that the first man on whom he set eyes was Primasso, who was in very\r\nsorry trim. The abbot, who knew him not by sight, no sooner saw him, than,\r\nsurprised by a churlish mood to which he had hitherto been an entire\r\nstranger, he said to himself:--\"So it is to such as this man that I give my\r\nhospitality;\" and going back into the chamber he bade lock the door, and\r\nasked of his attendants whether the vile fellow that sate at table directly\r\nopposite the door was known to any of them, who, one and all, answered in\r\nthe negative. Primasso waited a little, but he was not used to fast, and his\r\njourney had whetted his appetite. So, as the abbot did not return, he drew\r\nout one of the loaves which he had brought with him, and began to eat. The\r\nabbot, after a while, bade one of his servants go see whether Primasso were\r\ngone. The servant returned with the answer:--\"No, sir, and (what is more) he\r\nis eating a loaf of bread, which he seems to have brought with him.\" \"Be it\r\nso then,\" said the abbot, who was vexed that he was not gone of his own\r\naccord, but was not disposed to turn him out; \"let him eat his own bread, if\r\nhe have any, for he shall have none of ours today.\" By and by Primasso,\r\nhaving finished his first loaf, began, as the abbot did not make his\r\nappearance, to eat the second; which was likewise reported to the abbot, who\r\nhad again sent to see if he were gone. Finally, as the abbot still delayed\r\nhis coming, Primasso, having finished the second loaf, began upon the third;\r\nwhereof, once more, word was carried to the abbot, who now began to commune\r\nwith himself and say:--\"Alas! my soul, what unwonted mood harbourest thou\r\nto-day? What avarice? what scorn? and of whom? I have given my hospitality,\r\nnow for many a year, to whoso craved it, without looking to see whether he\r\nwere gentle or churl, poor or rich, merchant or cheat, and mine eyes have\r\nseen it squandered on vile fellows without number; and nought of that which\r\nI feel towards this man ever entered my mind. Assuredly it cannot be that he\r\nis a man of no consequence, who is the occasion of this access of avarice in\r\nme. Though he seem to me a vile fellow, he must be some great man, that my\r\nmind is thus obstinately averse to do him honour.\" Of which musings the\r\nupshot was that he sent to inquire who the vile fellow was, and learning\r\nthat he was Primasso, come to see if what he had heard of his magnificent\r\nstate were true, he was stricken with shame, having heard of old Primasso's\r\nfame, and knowing him to be a great man. Wherefore, being zealous to make\r\nhim the amend, he studied to do him honour in many ways; and after\r\nbreakfast, that his garb might accord with his native dignity, he caused him\r\nto be nobly arrayed, and setting him upon a palfrey and filling his purse,\r\nleft it to his own choice, whether to go or to stay. So Primasso, with a\r\nfull heart, thanked him for his courtesy in terms the amplest that he could\r\ncommand, and, having left Paris afoot, returned thither on horseback.\"\r\n\r\nMesser Cane was shrewd enough to apprehend Bergamino's meaning perfectly\r\nwell without a gloss, and said with a smile:--\"Bergamino, thy parable is\r\napt, and declares to me very plainly thy losses, my avarice, and what thou\r\ndesirest of me. And in good sooth this access of avarice, of which thou art\r\nthe occasion, is the first that I have experienced. But I will expel the\r\nintruder with the baton which thou thyself hast furnished.\" So he paid\r\nBergamino's reckoning, habited him nobly in one of his own robes, gave him\r\nmoney and a palfrey, and left it for the time at his discretion, whether to\r\ngo or to stay.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VIII.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGuglielmo Borsiere by a neat retort sharply censures avarice in Messer\r\nErmino de' Grimaldi.\r\n--\r\n\r\nNext Filostrato was seated Lauretta, who, when the praises bestowed on\r\nBergamino's address had ceased, knowing that it was now her turn to speak,\r\nwaited not for the word of command, but with a charming graciousness thus\r\nbegan:--\r\n\r\nThe last novel, dear gossips, prompts me to relate how a worthy man,\r\nlikewise a jester, reprehended not without success the greed of a very\r\nwealthy merchant; and, though the burden of my story is not unlike the last,\r\nyet, perchance, it may not on that account be the less appreciated by you,\r\nbecause it has a happy termination.\r\n\r\nKnow then that in Genoa there dwelt long ago a gentleman, who was known as\r\nMesser Ermino de' Grimaldi, and whose wealth, both in lands and money, was\r\ngenerally supposed to be far in excess of that of any other burgher then in\r\nItaly, and as in wealth he was without a rival in Italy, so in meanness and\r\navarice there was not any in the entire world, however richly endowed with\r\nthose qualities, whom he did not immeasurably surpass, insomuch that, not\r\nonly did he keep a tight grip upon his purse when honour was to be done to\r\nanother, but in his personal expenditure, even upon things meet and proper,\r\ncontrary to the general custom of the Genoese, whose wont is to array\r\nthemselves nobly, he was extremely penurious, as also in his outlay upon his\r\ntable. Wherefore, not without just cause, folk had dropped his surname de'\r\nGrimaldi, and called him instead Messer Ermino Avarizia. While thus by\r\nthrift his wealth waxed greater and greater, it so chanced that there came\r\nto Genoa a jester of good parts, a man debonair and ready of speech, his\r\nname Guglielmo Borsiere, whose like is not to be found to-day when jesters\r\n(to the great reproach be it spoken of those that claim the name and\r\nreputation of gentlemen) are rather to be called asses, being without\r\ncourtly breeding, and formed after the coarse pattern of the basest of\r\nchurls. And whereas in the days of which I speak they made it their\r\nbusiness, they spared no pains, to compose quarrels, to allay\r\nheart-burnings, between gentlemen, or arrange marriages, or leagues of\r\namity, ministering meanwhile relief to jaded minds and solace to courts by\r\nthe sprightly sallies of their wit, and with keen sarcasm, like fathers,\r\ncensuring churlish manners, being also satisfied with very trifling\r\nguerdons; nowadays all their care is to spend their time in\r\nscandal-mongering, in sowing discord, in saying, and (what is worse) in\r\ndoing in the presence of company things churlish and flagitious, in bringing\r\naccusations, true or false, of wicked, shameful or flagitious conduct\r\nagainst one another; and in drawing gentlemen into base and nefarious\r\npractices by sinister and insidious arts. And by these wretched and depraved\r\nlords he is held most dear and best rewarded whose words and deeds are the\r\nmost atrocious, to the great reproach and scandal of the world of to-day;\r\nwhereby it is abundantly manifest that virtue has departed from the earth,\r\nleaving a degenerate generation to wallow in the lowest depths of vice.\r\n\r\nBut reverting to the point at which I started, wherefrom under stress of\r\njust indignation I have deviated somewhat further than I intended, I say\r\nthat the said Guglielmo was had in honour, and was well received by all the\r\ngentlemen of Genoa; and tarrying some days in the city, heard much of the\r\nmeanness and avarice of Messer Ermino, and was curious to see him. Now\r\nMesser Ermino had heard that this Guglielmo Borsiere was a man of good\r\nparts, and, notwithstanding his avarice, having in him some sparks of good\r\nbreeding, received him with words of hearty greeting and a gladsome mien,\r\nand conversed freely with him and of divers matters, and so conversing, took\r\nhim with other Genoese that were of his company to a new and very beautiful\r\nhouse which he had built, and after shewing him over the whole of it, said\r\nto him:--\"Now, Messer Guglielmo, you have seen and heard many things; could\r\nyou suggest to me something, the like of which has not hitherto been seen,\r\nwhich I might have painted here in the saloon of this house?\" To which\r\nill-judged question Guglielmo replied:--\"Sir, it would not, I think, be in\r\nmy power to suggest anything the like of which has never been seen, unless\r\nit were a sneeze or something similar; but if it so please you, I have\r\nsomething to suggest, which, I think, you have never seen.\" \"Prithee, what\r\nmay that be?\" said Messer Ermino, not expecting to get the answer which he\r\ngot. For Guglielmo replied forthwith:--\"Paint Courtesy here;\" which Messer\r\nErmino had no sooner heard, than he was so stricken with shame that his\r\ndisposition underwent a complete change, and he said:--\"Messer, Guglielmo, I\r\nwill see to it that Courtesy is here painted in such wise that neither you\r\nnor any one else shall ever again have reason to tell me that I have not\r\nseen or known that virtue.\" And henceforward (so enduring was the change\r\nwrought by Guglielmo's words) there was not in Genoa, while he lived, any\r\ngentleman so liberal and so gracious and so lavish of honour both to\r\nstrangers and to his fellow-citizens as Messer Ermino de' Grimaldi.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL IX.\r\n\r\n--\r\nThe censure of a Gascon lady converts the King of Cyprus from a churlish to\r\nan honourable temper.\r\n--\r\n\r\nExcept Elisa none now remained to answer the call of the queen, and she\r\nwithout waiting for it, with gladsome alacrity thus began:--\r\n\r\nBethink you, damsels, how often it has happened that men who have been\r\nobdurate to censures and chastisements have been reclaimed by some\r\nunpremeditated casual word. This is plainly manifest by the story told by\r\nLauretta; and by mine, which will be of the briefest, I mean further to\r\nillustrate it; seeing that, good stories, being always pleasurable, are\r\nworth listening to with attention, no matter by whom they may be told.\r\n\r\n'Twas, then, in the time of the first king of Cyprus, after the conquest\r\nmade of the Holy Land by Godfrey de Bouillon, that a lady of Gascony made a\r\npilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre, and on her way home, having landed at\r\nCyprus, met with brutal outrage at the hands of certain ruffians.\r\nBroken-hearted and disconsolate she determined to make her complaint to the\r\nking; but she was told that it would be all in vain, because so spiritless\r\nand faineant was he that he not only neglected to avenge affronts put upon\r\nothers, but endured with a reprehensible tameness those which were offered\r\nto himself, insomuch that whoso had any ill-humour to vent, took occasion to\r\nvex or mortify him. The lady, hearing this report, despaired of redress, and\r\nby way of alleviation of her grief determined to make the king sensible of\r\nhis baseness. So in tears she presented herself before him and said:--\"Sire,\r\nit is not to seek redress of the wrong done me that I come here before you:\r\nbut only that, so please you, I may learn of you how it is that you suffer\r\npatiently the wrongs which, as I understand, are done you; that thus\r\nschooled by you in patience I may endure my own, which, God knows, I would\r\ngladly, were it possible, transfer to you, seeing that you are so well\r\nfitted to bear them.\" These words aroused the hitherto sluggish and\r\napathetic king as it were from sleep. He redressed the lady's wrong, and\r\nhaving thus made a beginning, thenceforth meted out the most rigorous\r\njustice to all that in any wise offended against the majesty of his crown.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL X.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMaster Alberto da Bologna honourably puts to shame a lady who sought\r\noccasion to put him to shame in that he was in love with her.\r\n--\r\n\r\nAfter Elisa had done, it only remained for the queen to conclude the day's\r\nstory-telling, and thus with manner debonair did she begin:--\r\n\r\nAs stars in the serene expanse of heaven, as in spring-time flowers in the\r\ngreen pastures, so, honourable damsels, in the hour of rare and excellent\r\nconverse is wit with its bright sallies. Which, being brief, are much more\r\nproper for ladies than for men, seeing that prolixity of speech, when\r\nbrevity is possible, is much less allowable to them; albeit (shame be to us\r\nall and all our generation) few ladies or none are left to-day who\r\nunderstand aught that is wittily said, or understanding are able to answer\r\nit. For the place of those graces of the spirit which distinguished the\r\nladies of the past has now been usurped by adornments of the person; and she\r\nwhose dress is most richly and variously and curiously dight, accounts\r\nherself more worthy to be had in honour, forgetting, that, were one but so\r\nto array him, an ass would carry a far greater load of finery than any of\r\nthem, and for all that be not a whit the more deserving of honour. I blush\r\nto say this, for in censuring others I condemn myself. Tricked out,\r\nbedecked, bedizened thus, we are either silent and impassive as statues, or,\r\nif we answer aught that is said to us, much better were it we had held our\r\npeace. And we make believe, forsooth, that our failure to acquit ourselves\r\nin converse with our equals of either sex does but proceed from\r\nguilelessness; dignifying stupidity by the name of modesty, as if no lady\r\ncould be modest and converse with other folk than her maid or laundress or\r\nbake-house woman; which if Nature had intended, as we feign she did, she\r\nwould have set other limits to our garrulousness. True it is that in this,\r\nas in other matters, time and place and person are to be regarded; because\r\nit sometimes happens that a lady or gentleman thinking by some sally of wit\r\nto put another to shame, has rather been put to shame by that other, having\r\nfailed duly to estimate their relative powers. Wherefore, that you may be on\r\nyour guard against such error, and, further, that in you be not exemplified\r\nthe common proverb, to wit, that women do ever and on all occasions choose\r\nthe worst, I trust that this last of to-day's stories, which falls to me to\r\ntell, may serve you as a lesson; that, as you are distinguished from others\r\nby nobility of nature, so you may also shew yourselves separate from them by\r\nexcellence of manners.\r\n\r\nThere lived not many years ago, perhaps yet lives, in Bologna, a very great\r\nphysician, so great that the fame of his skill was noised abroad throughout\r\nalmost the entire world.\r\n\r\nNow Master Alberto (such was his name) was of so noble a temper that, being\r\nnow nigh upon seventy years of age, and all but devoid of natural heat of\r\nbody, he was yet receptive of the flames of love; and having at an assembly\r\nseen a very beautiful widow lady, Madonna Malgherida de' Ghisolieri, as some\r\nsay, and being charmed with her beyond measure, was, notwithstanding his\r\nage, no less ardently enamoured than a young man, insomuch that he was not\r\nwell able to sleep at night, unless during the day he had seen the fair\r\nlady's lovely and delicate features. Wherefore he began to frequent the\r\nvicinity of her house, passing to and fro in front of it, now on foot now on\r\nhorseback, as occasion best served. Which she and many other ladies\r\nperceiving, made merry together more than once, to see a man of his years\r\nand discretion in love, as if they deemed that this most delightful passion\r\nof love were only fit for empty-headed youths, and could not in men be\r\neither harboured or engendered. Master Alberto thus continuing to haunt the\r\nfront of the house, it so happened that one feast-day the lady with other\r\nladies was seated before her door, and Master Alberto's approach being thus\r\nobserved by them for some time before he arrived, they complotted to receive\r\nhim and shew him honour, and then to rally him on his love; and so they did,\r\nrising with one accord to receive him, bidding him welcome, and ushering him\r\ninto a cool courtyard, where they regaled him with the finest wines and\r\ncomfits; which done, in a tone of refined and sprightly banter they asked\r\nhim how it came about that he was enamoured of this fair lady, seeing that\r\nshe was beloved of many a fine gentleman of youth and spirit. Master\r\nAlberto, being thus courteously assailed, put a blithe face on it, and\r\nanswered:--\"Madam, my love for you need surprise none that is conversant\r\nwith such matters, and least of all you that are worthy of it. And though\r\nold men, of course, have lost the strength which love demands for its full\r\nfruition, yet are they not therefore without the good intent and just\r\nappreciation of what beseems the accepted lover, but indeed understand it\r\nfar better than young men, by reason that they have more experience. My hope\r\nin thus old aspiring to love you, who are loved by so many young men, is\r\nfounded on what I have frequently observed of ladies' ways at lunch, when\r\nthey trifle with the lupin and the leek. In the leek no part is good, but\r\nthe head is at any rate not so bad as the rest, and indeed not unpalatable;\r\nyou, however, for the most part, following a depraved taste, hold it in your\r\nhand and munch the leaves, which are not only of no account but actually\r\ndistasteful. How am I to know, madam, that in your selection of lovers, you\r\nare not equally eccentric? In which case I should be the man of your choice,\r\nand the rest would be cast aside.\" Whereto the gentle lady, somewhat\r\nshame-stricken, as were also her fair friends, thus made answer:--\"Master\r\nAlberto, our presumption has received from you a most just and no less\r\ncourteous reproof; but your love is dear to me, as should ever be that of a\r\nwise and worthy man. And therefore, saving my honour, I am yours, entirely\r\nand devotedly at your pleasure and command.\" This speech brought Master\r\nAlberto to his feet, and the others also rising, he thanked the lady for her\r\ncourtesy, bade her a gay and smiling adieu, and so left the house. Thus the\r\nlady, not considering on whom she exercised her wit, thinking to conquer was\r\nconquered herself--against which mishap you, if you are discreet, will ever\r\nbe most strictly on your guard.\r\n\r\nAs the young ladies and the three young men finished their storytelling the\r\nsun was westering and the heat of the day in great measure abated. Which\r\ntheir queen observing, debonairly thus she spoke:--\"Now, dear gossips, my\r\nday of sovereignty draws to a close, and nought remains for me to do but to\r\ngive you a new queen, by whom on the morrow our common life may be ordered\r\nas she may deem best in a course of seemly pleasure; and though there seems\r\nto be still some interval between day and night, yet, as whoso does not in\r\nsome degree anticipate the course of time, cannot well provide for the\r\nfuture; and in order that what the new queen shall decide to be meet for the\r\nmorrow may be made ready beforehand, I decree that from this time forth the\r\ndays begin at this hour. And so in reverent submission to Him in whom is the\r\nlife of all beings, for our comfort and solace we commit the governance of\r\nour realm for the morrow into the hands of Queen Filomena, most discreet of\r\ndamsels.\" So saying she arose, took the laurel wreath from her brow, and\r\nwith a gesture of reverence set it on the brow of Filomena, whom she then,\r\nand after her all the other ladies and the young men, saluted as queen,\r\ndoing her due and graceful homage.\r\n\r\nQueen Filomena modestly blushed a little to find herself thus invested with\r\nthe sovereignty; but, being put on her mettle by Pampinea's recent\r\nadmonitions, she was minded not to seem awkward, and soon recovered her\r\ncomposure. She then began by confirming all the appointments made by\r\nPampinea, and making all needful arrangements for the following morning and\r\nevening, which they were to pass where they then were. Whereupon she thus\r\nspoke:--\"Dearest gossips, though, thanks rather to Pampinea's courtesy than\r\nto merit of mine, I am made queen of you all, yet I am not on that account\r\nminded to have respect merely to my own judgment in the governance of our\r\nlife, but to unite your wisdom with mine; and that you may understand what I\r\nthink of doing, and by consequence may be able to amplify or curtail it at\r\nyour pleasure, I will in few words make known to you my purpose. The course\r\nobserved by Pampinea to-day, if I have judged aright, seems to be alike\r\ncommendable and delectable; wherefore, until by lapse of time, or for some\r\nother cause, it grow tedious, I purpose not to alter it. So when we have\r\narranged for what we have already taken in hand, we will go hence and enjoy\r\na short walk; at sundown we will sup in the cool; and we will then sing a\r\nfew songs and otherwise divert ourselves, until it is time to go to sleep.\r\nTo-morrow we will rise in the cool of the morning, and after enjoying\r\nanother walk, each at his or her sweet will, we will return, as to-day, and\r\nin due time break our fast, dance, sleep, and having risen, will here resume\r\nour story-telling, wherein, methinks, pleasure and profit unite in\r\nsuperabundant measure. True it is that Pampinea, by reason of her late\r\nelection to the sovereignty, neglected one matter, which I mean to\r\nintroduce, to wit, the circumscription of the topic of our story-telling,\r\nand its preassignment, that each may be able to premeditate some apt story\r\nbearing upon the theme; and seeing that from the beginning of the world\r\nFortune has made men the sport of divers accidents, and so it will continue\r\nuntil the end, the theme, so please you, shall in each case be the same; to\r\nwit, the fortune of such as after divers adventures have at last attained a\r\ngoal of unexpected felicity.\r\n\r\nThe ladies and the young men alike commended the rule thus laid down, and\r\nagreed to follow it. Dioneo, however, when the rest had done speaking,\r\nsaid:--\"Madam, as all the rest have said, so say I, briefly, that the rule\r\nprescribed by you is commendable and delectable; but of your especial grace\r\nI crave a favour, which, I trust, may be granted and continued to me, so\r\nlong as our company shall endure; which favour is this: that I be not bound\r\nby the assigned theme if I am not so minded, but that I have leave to choose\r\nsuch topic as best shall please me. And lest any suppose that I crave this\r\ngrace as one that has not stories ready to hand, I am henceforth content\r\nthat mine be always the last.\" The queen, knowing him to be a merry and\r\nfacetious fellow, and feeling sure that he only craved this favour in order\r\nthat, if the company were jaded, he might have an opportunity to recreate\r\nthem by some amusing story, gladly, with the consent of the rest, granted\r\nhis petition. She then rose, and attended by the rest sauntered towards a\r\nstream, which, issuing clear as crystal from a neighbouring hill,\r\nprecipitated itself into a valley shaded by trees close set amid living rock\r\nand fresh green herbage. Bare of foot and arm they entered the stream, and\r\nroving hither and thither amused themselves in divers ways till in due time\r\nthey returned to the palace, and gaily supped. Supper ended, the queen sent\r\nfor instruments of music, and bade Lauretta lead a dance, while Emilia was\r\nto sing a song accompanied by Dioneo on the lute.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Lauretta led a dance, while Emilia with passion sang the\r\nfollowing song:\r\n\r\nSo fain I am of my own loveliness,\r\n    I hope, nor think not e'er\r\n  The weight to feel of other amorousness.\r\n\r\nWhen in the mirror I my face behold,\r\n  That see I there which doth my mind content,\r\n  Nor any present hap or memory old\r\n  May me deprive of such sweet ravishment.\r\n  Where else, then, should I find such blandishment\r\n     Of sight and sense that e'er\r\n  My heart should know another amorousness?\r\n\r\nNor need I fear lest the fair thing retreat,\r\n  When fain I am my solace to renew;\r\n  Rather, I know, 'twill me advance to meet,\r\n  To pleasure me, and shew so sweet a view\r\n  That speech or thought of none its semblance true\r\n     Paint or conceive may e'er,\r\n  Unless he burn with ev'n such amorousness.\r\n\r\nThereon as more intent I gaze, the fire\r\n  Waxeth within me hourly, more and more,\r\n  Myself I yield thereto, myself entire,\r\n  And foretaste have of what it hath in store,\r\n  And hope of greater joyance than before,\r\n    Nay, such as ne'er\r\n  None knew; for ne'er was felt such amorousness.\r\n\r\nThis ballade, to which all heartily responded, albeit its words furnished\r\nmuch matter of thought to some, was followed by some other dances, and part\r\nof the brief night being thus spent, the queen proclaimed the first day\r\nended, and bade light the torches that all might go to rest until the\r\nfollowing morning; and so, seeking their several chambers, to rest they\r\nwent.\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nEndeth here the first day of the Decameron; beginneth the second, in which,\r\nunder the rule of Filomena, they discourse of the fortunes of such as after\r\ndivers misadventures have at last attained a goal of unexpected felicity.\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe sun was already trailing the new day in his wake of light, and the\r\nbirds, blithely chanting their lays among the green boughs, carried the\r\ntidings to the ear, when with one accord all the ladies and the three young\r\nmen arose, and entered the gardens, where for no little time they found\r\ntheir delight in sauntering about the dewy meads, straying hither and\r\nthither, culling flowers, and weaving them into fair garlands. The day\r\npassed like its predecessor; they breakfasted in the shade, and danced and\r\nslept until noon, when they rose, and, at their queen's behest, assembled in\r\nthe cool meadow, and sat them down in a circle about her. Fair and very\r\ndebonair she shewed, crowned with her laurel wreath, as for a brief space\r\nshe scanned the company, and then bade Neifile shew others the way with a\r\nstory. Neifile made no excuse, and gaily thus began.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL I.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMartellino pretends to be a paralytic, and makes it appear as if he were\r\ncured by being placed upon the body of St. Arrigo. His trick is detected; he\r\nis beaten and arrested, and is in peril of hanging, but finally escapes.\r\n--\r\n\r\nOften has it happened, dearest ladies, that one who has studied to raise a\r\nlaugh at others' expense, especially in regard of things worthy to be had in\r\nreverence, has found the laugh turn against himself, and sometimes to his\r\nloss: as, in obedience to the queen's command, and by way of introducing our\r\ntheme, I am about to shew you, by the narrative of an adventure which befell\r\none of our own citizens, and after a course of evil fortune had an entirely\r\nunexpected and very felicitous issue.\r\n\r\nNot long ago there was at Treviso a German, named Arrigo, a poor man who got\r\nhis living as a common hired porter, but though of so humble a condition,\r\nwas respected by all, being accounted not only an honest but a most holy\r\nman; insomuch that, whether truly or falsely I know not, the Trevisans\r\naffirm, that on his decease all the bells of the cathedral of Treviso began\r\nto toll of their own accord. Which being accounted a miracle, this Arrigo\r\nwas generally reputed a saint; and all the people of the city gathered\r\nbefore the house where his body lay, and bore it, with a saint's honours,\r\ninto the cathedral, and brought thither the halt and paralytic and blind,\r\nand others afflicted with disease or bodily defects, as hoping that by\r\ncontact with this holy body they would all be healed. The people thus\r\ntumultuously thronging the church, it so chanced that there arrived in\r\nTreviso three of our own citizens, of whom one was named Stecchi, another\r\nMartellino, and the third Marchese; all three being men whose habit it was\r\nto frequent the courts of the nobles and afford spectators amusement by\r\nassuming disguises and personating other men. Being entire strangers to the\r\nplace, and seeing everybody running to and fro, they were much astonished,\r\nand having learned the why and wherefore, were curious to go see what was to\r\nbe seen. So at the inn, where they put up, Marchese began:--\"We would fain\r\ngo see this saint; but for my part I know not how we are to reach the spot,\r\nfor I hear the piazza is full of Germans and other armed men, posted there\r\nby the Lord who rules here to prevent an uproar, and moreover the church, so\r\nfar as one may learn, is so full of folk that scarce another soul may enter\r\nit.\" Whereupon Martellino, who was bent on seeing what was to be seen,\r\nsaid:--\"Let not this deter us; I will assuredly find a way of getting to the\r\nsaint's body.\" \"How?\" rejoined Marchese. \"I will tell you,\" replied\r\nMartellino; \"I will counterfeit a paralytic, and thou wilt support me on one\r\nside and Stecchi on the other, as if I were not able to go alone, and so you\r\nwill enter the church, making it appear as if you were leading me up to the\r\nbody of the saint that he may heal me, and all that see will make way and\r\ngive us free passage.\" Marchese and Stecchi approved the plan; so all three\r\nforthwith left the inn and repaired to a lonely place, where Martellino\r\ndistorted his hands, his fingers, his arms, his legs, and also his mouth and\r\neyes and his entire face in a manner horrible to contemplate; so that no\r\nstranger that saw him could have doubted that he was impotent and paralysed\r\nin every part of his body. In this guise Marchese and Stecchi laid hold of\r\nhim, and led him towards the church, assuming a most piteous air, and humbly\r\nbeseeching everybody for God's sake to make way for them. Their request was\r\nreadily granted; and, in short, observed by all, and crying out at almost\r\nevery step, \"make way, make way,\" they reached the place where St. Arrigo's\r\nbody was laid. Whereupon some gentlemen who stood by, hoisted Martellino on\r\nto the saint's body, that thereby he might receive the boon of health. There\r\nhe lay still for a while, the eyes of all in the church being riveted upon\r\nhim in expectation of the result; then, being a very practised performer, he\r\nstretched, first, one of his fingers, next a hand, afterwards an arm, and so\r\nforth, making as if he gradually recovered the use of all his natural\r\npowers. Which the people observing raised such a clamour in honour of St.\r\nArrigo that even thunder would have been inaudible. Now it chanced that hard\r\nby stood a Florentine, who knew Martellino well, though he had failed to\r\nrecognise him, when, in such strange guise, he was led into the church; but\r\nnow, seeing him resume his natural shape, the Florentine recognised him, and\r\nat once said with a laugh\u00b0\"God's curse upon him. Who that saw him come but\r\nwould have believed that he was really paralysed?\" These words were\r\noverheard by some of the Trevisans, who began forthwith to question the\r\nFlorentine. \"How?\" said they; \"was he then not paralysed? No, by God\r\nreturned the Florentine he has always been as straight as any of us; he has\r\nmerely shewn you that he knows better than any man alive how to play this\r\ntrick of putting on any counterfeit semblance that he chooses.\" Thereupon\r\nthe Trevisans, without further parley, made a rush, clearing the way and\r\ncrying out as they went:--\"Seize this traitor who mocks at God and His\r\nsaints; who, being no paralytic, has come hither in the guise of a paralytic\r\nto deride our patron saint and us.\" So saying, they laid hands on him,\r\ndragged him down from where he stood, seized him by the hair, tore the\r\nclothes from his back, and fell to beating and kicking him, so that it\r\nseemed to him as if all the world were upon him. He cried out:--\"Pity, for\r\nGod's sake,\" and defended himself as best he could: all in vain, however;\r\nthe press became thicker and thicker moment by moment. Which Stecchi and\r\nMarchese observing began to say one to the other that 'twas a bad business;\r\nyet, being apprehensive on their own account, they did not venture to come\r\nto his assistance, but cried out with the rest that he ought to die, at the\r\nsame time, however, casting about how they might find the means to rescue\r\nhim from the hands of the people, who would certainly have killed him, but\r\nfor a diversion which Marchese hastily effected. The entire posse of the\r\nsignory being just outside, he ran off at full speed to the Podesta's\r\nlieutenant, and said to him:--\"Help, for God's sake; there is a villain here\r\nthat has cut my purse with full a hundred florins of gold in it; prithee\r\nhave him arrested that I may have my own again.\" Whereupon, twelve sergeants\r\nor more ran forthwith to the place where hapless Martellino was being carded\r\nwithout a comb, and, forcing their way with the utmost difficulty through\r\nthe throng, rescued him all bruised and battered from their hands, and led\r\nhim to the palace; whither he was followed by many who, resenting what he\r\nhad done, and hearing that he was arrested as a cutpurse, and lacking better\r\npretext for harassing him, began one and all to charge him with having cut\r\ntheir purses. All which the deputy of the Podesta had no sooner heard, than,\r\nbeing a harsh man, he straightway took Martellino aside and began to examine\r\nhim. Martellino answered his questions in a bantering tone, making light of\r\nthe arrest; whereat the deputy, losing patience, had him bound to the\r\nstrappado, and caused him to receive a few hints of the cord with intent to\r\nextort from him a confession of his guilt, by way of preliminary to hanging\r\nhim. Taken down from the strappado, and questioned by the deputy if what his\r\naccusers said were true, Martellino, as nothing was to be gained by denial,\r\nanswered:--\"My lord, I am ready to confess the truth; let but my accusers\r\nsay, each of them, when and where I cut his purse, and I will tell you what\r\nI have and what I have not done.\" \"So be it,\" said the deputy, and caused a\r\nfew of them to be summoned. Whereupon Martellino, being charged with having\r\ncut this, that or the other man's purse eight, six or four days ago, while\r\nothers averred that he had cut their purses that very day, answered thus:--\r\n\"My lord, these men lie in the throat, and for token that I speak true, I\r\ntell you that, so far from having been here as long as they make out, it is\r\nbut very lately that I came into these parts, where I never was before; and\r\nno sooner was I come, than, as my ill-luck would have it, I went to see the\r\nbody of this saint, and so have been carded as you see; and that what I say\r\nis true, his Lordship's intendant of arrivals, and his book, and also my\r\nhost may certify. Wherefore, if you find that even so it is as I say,\r\nhearken not to these wicked men, and spare me the torture and death which\r\nthey would have you inflict.\" In this posture of affairs Marchese and\r\nStecchi, learning that the Podesta's deputy was dealing rigorously with\r\nMartellino, and had already put him to the strappado, grew mightily alarmed.\r\n\"We have made a mess of it,\" they said to themselves; \"we have only taken\r\nhim out of the frying-pan to toss him into the fire.\" So, hurrying hither\r\nand thither with the utmost zeal, they made diligent search until they found\r\ntheir host, and told him how matters stood. The host had his laugh over the\r\naffair, and then brought them to one Sandro Agolanti, who dwelt in Treviso\r\nand had great interest with the Lord of the place. The host laid the whole\r\nmatter before Sandro, and, backed by Marchese and Stecchi, besought him to\r\nundertake Martellino's cause. Sandro, after many a hearty laugh, hied him to\r\nthe Lord, who at his instance sent for Martellino. The messengers found\r\nMartellino still in his shirt before the deputy, at his wits' end, and all\r\nbut beside himself with fear, because the deputy would hear nothing that he\r\nsaid in his defence. Indeed, the deputy, having a spite against Florentines,\r\nhad quite made up his mind to have him hanged; he was therefore in the last\r\ndegree reluctant to surrender him to the Lord, and only did so upon\r\ncompulsion. Brought at length before the Lord, Martellino detailed to him\r\nthe whole affair, and prayed him as the greatest of favours to let him\r\ndepart in peace. The Lord had a hearty laugh over the adventure, and\r\nbestowed a tunic on each of the three. So, congratulating themselves on\r\ntheir unexpected deliverance from so great a peril, they returned home safe\r\nand sound.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL II.\r\n\r\n--\r\nRinaldo d'Asti is robbed, arrives at Castel Guglielmo, and is entertained by\r\na widow lady; his property is restored to him, and he returns home safe and\r\nsound.\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe ladies and the young men, especially Filostrato, laughed inordinately at\r\nNeifile's narrative of Martellino's misadventures. Then Filostrato, who sate\r\nnext Neifile, received the queen's command to follow her, and promptly thus\r\nbegan:--\r\n\r\nFair ladies, 'tis on my mind to tell you a story in which are mingled things\r\nsacred and passages of adverse fortune and love, which to hear will\r\nperchance be not unprofitable, more especially to travellers in love's\r\ntreacherous lands; of whom if any fail to say St. Julian's paternoster, it\r\noften happens that, though he may have a good bed, he is ill lodged.\r\n\r\nKnow, then, that in the time of the Marquis Azzo da Ferrara, a merchant,\r\nRinaldo d'Asti by name, having disposed of certain affairs which had brought\r\nhim to Bologna, set his face homeward, and having left Ferrara behind him\r\nwas on his way to Verona, when he fell in with some men that looked like\r\nmerchants, but were in truth robbers and men of evil life and condition,\r\nwhose company he imprudently joined, riding and conversing with them. They,\r\nperceiving that he was a merchant, and judging that he must have money about\r\nhim, complotted to rob him on the first opportunity; and to obviate\r\nsuspicion they played the part of worthy and reputable men, their discourse\r\nof nought but what was seemly and honourable and leal, their demeanour at\r\nonce as respectful and as cordial as they could make it; so that he deemed\r\nhimself very lucky to have met with them, being otherwise alone save for a\r\nsingle mounted servant. Journeying thus, they conversed after the desultory\r\nmanner of travellers, of divers matters, until at last they fell a talking\r\nof the prayers which men address to God, and one of the robbers--there were\r\nthree of them--said to Rinaldo:--\"And you, gentle sir, what is your wonted\r\norison when you are on your travels?\" Rinaldo answered:--\"Why, to tell the\r\ntruth, I am a man unskilled, unlearned in such matters, and few prayers have\r\nI at my command, being one that lives in the good old way and lets two soldi\r\ncount for twenty-four deniers; nevertheless it has always been my custom in\r\njourneying to say of a morning, as I leave the inn, a paternoster and an\r\navemaria for the souls of the father and mother of St. Julian, after which I\r\npray God and St. Julian to provide me with a good inn for the night. And\r\nmany a time in the course of my life have I met with great perils by the\r\nway, and evading them all have found comfortable quarters for the night:\r\nwhereby my faith is assured, that St. Julian, in whose honour I say my\r\npaternoster, has gotten me this favour of God; nor should I look for a\r\nprosperous journey and a safe arrival at night, if I had not said it in the\r\nmorning.\" Then said his interrogator:--\"And did you say it this morning?\"\r\nWhereto Rinaldo answered, \"Troth, did I,\" which caused the other, who by\r\nthis time knew what course matters would take, to say to himself:--\"'Twill\r\nprove to have been said in the nick of time; for if we do not miscarry, I\r\ntake it thou wilt have but a sorry lodging.\" Then turning to Rinaldo he\r\nsaid:--\"I also have travelled much, and never a prayer have I said though I\r\nhave heard them much, commended by many, nor has it ever been my lot to find\r\nother than good quarters for the night; it may be that this very evening you\r\nwill be able to determine which of us has the better lodging, you that have\r\nsaid the paternoster, or I that have not said it. True, however, it is that\r\nin its stead I am accustomed to say the 'Dirupisti,' or the 'Intemerata,' or\r\nthe 'De profundis,' which, if what my grandmother used to say is to be\r\nbelieved, are of the greatest efficacy.\" So, talking of divers matters, and\r\never on the look-out for time and place suited to their evil purpose, they\r\ncontinued their journey, until towards evening, some distance from Castel\r\nGuglielmo, as they were about to ford a stream, these three ruffians,\r\nprofiting by the lateness of the hour, and the loneliness and straitness of\r\nthe place, set upon Rinaldo and robbed him, and leaving him afoot and in his\r\nshirt, said by way of adieu:--\"Go now, and see if thy St. Julian will\r\nprovide thee with good lodging to-night; our saint, we doubt not, will do as\r\nmuch by us;\" and so crossing the stream, they went their way. Rinaldo's\r\nservant, coward that he was, did nothing to help his master when he saw him\r\nattacked, but turned his horse's head, and was off at a smart pace; nor did\r\nhe draw rein until he was come to Castel Guglielmo; where, it being now\r\nevening, he put up at an inn and gave himself no further trouble. Rinaldo,\r\nleft barefoot, and stripped to his shirt, while the night closed in very\r\ncold and snowy, was at his wits' end, and shivering so that his teeth\r\nchattered in his head, began to peer about, if haply he might find some\r\nshelter for the night, that so he might not perish with the cold; but,\r\nseeing none (for during a recent war the whole country had been wasted by\r\nfire), he set off for Castel Guglielmo, quickening his pace by reason of the\r\ncold. Whether his servant had taken refuge in Castel Guglielmo or elsewhere,\r\nhe knew not, but he thought that, could he but enter the town, God would\r\nsurely send him some succour. However, dark night overtook him while he was\r\nstill about a mile from the castle; so that on his arrival he found the\r\ngates already locked and the bridges raised, and he could not pass in. Sick\r\nat heart, disconsolate and bewailing his evil fortune, he looked about for\r\nsome place where he might ensconce himself, and at any rate find shelter\r\nfrom the snow. And by good luck he espied a house, built with a balcony a\r\nlittle above the castle-wall, under which balcony he purposed to shelter\r\nhimself until daybreak. Arrived at the spot, he found beneath the balcony a\r\npostern, which, however, was locked; and having gathered some bits of straw\r\nthat lay about, he placed them in front of the postern, and there in sad and\r\nsorrowful plight took up his quarters, with many a piteous appeal to St.\r\nJulian, whom he reproached for not better rewarding the faith which he\r\nreposed in him. St. Julian, however, had not abandoned him, and in due time\r\nprovided him with a good lodging.\r\n\r\nThere was in the castle a widow lady of extraordinary beauty (none fairer)\r\nwhom Marquis Azzo loved as his own life, and kept there for his pleasure.\r\nShe lived in the very same house beneath the balcony of which Rinaldo had\r\nposted himself. Now it chanced that that very day the Marquis had come to\r\nCastel Guglielmo to pass the night with her, and had privily caused a bath\r\nto be made ready, and a supper suited to his rank, in the lady's own house.\r\nThe arrangements were complete; and only the Marquis was stayed for, when a\r\nservant happened to present himself at the castle-gate, bringing tidings for\r\nthe Marquis which obliged him suddenly to take horse. He therefore sent word\r\nto the lady that she must not wait for him, and forthwith took his\r\ndeparture. The lady, somewhat disconsolate, found nothing better to do than\r\nto get into the bath which had been intended for the Marquis, sup and go to\r\nbed: so into the bath she went. The bath was close to the postern on the\r\nother side of which hapless Rinaldo had ensconced himself, and, thus the\r\nmournful and quavering music which Rinaldo made as he shuddered in the cold,\r\nand which seemed rather to proceed from a stork's beak than from the mouth\r\nof a human being, was audible to the lady in the bath. She therefore called\r\nher maid, and said to her:--\"Go up and look out over the wall and down at\r\nthe postern, and mark who is there, and what he is, and what he does there.\"\r\nThe maid obeyed, and, the night being fine, had no difficulty in making out\r\nRinaldo as he sate there, barefoot, as I have, said, and in his shirt, and\r\ntrembling in every limb. So she called out to him, to know who he was.\r\nRinaldo, who could scarcely articulate for shivering, told as briefly as he\r\ncould, who he was, and how and why he came to be there; which done, he began\r\npiteously to, beseech her not, if she could avoid it, to leave him there all\r\nnight to perish of cold. The maid went back to her mistress full of pity for\r\nRinaldo, and told her all she had seen and heard. The lady felt no less pity\r\nfor Rinaldo; and bethinking her that she had the key of the postern by which\r\nthe Marquis sometimes entered when he paid her a secret visit, she said to\r\nthe maid:--\"Go, and let him in softly; here is this supper, and there will\r\nbe none to eat it; and we can very well put him up for the night.\" Cordially\r\ncommending her mistress's humanity, the maid went and let Rinaldo in, and\r\nbrought him to the lady, who, seeing that he was all but dead with cold,\r\nsaid to him:--\"Quick, good man, get into that bath, which is still warm.\"\r\nGladly he did so, awaiting no second invitation, and was so much comforted\r\nby its warmth that he seemed to have passed from death to life. The lady\r\nprovided him with a suit of clothes, which had been worn by her husband\r\nshortly before his death, and which, when he had them on, looked as if they\r\nhad been made for him. So he recovered heart, and, while he awaited the\r\nlady's commands, gave thanks to God and St. Julian for delivering him from a\r\nwoful night and conducting him, as it seemed, to comfortable quarters.\r\n\r\nThe lady meanwhile took a little rest, after which she had a roaring fire\r\nput in one of her large rooms, whither presently she came, and asked her\r\nmaid how the good man did. The maid replied:--\"Madam, he has put on the\r\nclothes, in which he shews to advantage, having a handsome person, and\r\nseeming to be a worthy man, and well-bred.\" \"Go, call him then,\" said the\r\nlady, \"tell him to come hither to the fire, and we will sup; for I know that\r\nhe has not supped.\" Rinaldo, on entering the room and seeing the lady, took\r\nher to be of no small consequence. He therefore made her a low bow, and did\r\nhis utmost to thank her worthily for the service she had rendered him. His\r\nwords pleased her no less than his person, which accorded with what the maid\r\nhad said: so she made him heartily welcome, installed him at his ease by her\r\nside before the fire, and questioned him of the adventure which had brought\r\nhim thither. Rinaldo detailed all the circumstances, of which the lady had\r\nheard somewhat when Rinaldo's servant made his appearance at the castle. She\r\ntherefore gave entire credence to what he said, and told him what she knew\r\nabout his servant, and how he might easily find him on the morrow. She then\r\nbade set the table, which done, Rinaldo and she washed their hands and sate\r\ndown together to sup. Tall he was and comely of form and feature, debonair\r\nand gracious of mien and manner, and in his lusty prime. The lady had eyed\r\nhim again and again to her no small satisfaction, and, her wantonness being\r\nalready kindled for the Marquis, who was to have come to lie with her, she\r\nhad let Rinaldo take the vacant place in her mind. So when supper was done,\r\nand they were risen from the table, she conferred with her maid, whether,\r\nafter the cruel trick played upon her by the Marquis, it were not well to\r\ntake the good gift which Fortune had sent her. The maid knowing the bent of\r\nher mistress's desire, left no word unsaid that might encourage her to\r\nfollow it. Wherefore the lady, turning towards Rinaldo, who was standing\r\nwhere she had left him by the fire, began thus:--\"So! Rinaldo, why still so\r\npensive? Will nothing console you for the loss of a horse and a few clothes?\r\nTake heart, put a blithe face on it, you are at home; nay more, let me tell\r\nyou that, seeing you in those clothes which my late husband used to wear,\r\nand taking you for him, I have felt, not once or twice, but perhaps a\r\nhundred times this evening, a longing to throw my arms round you and kiss\r\nyou; and, in faith, I had so done, but that I feared it might displease\r\nyou.\" Rinaldo, hearing these words, and marking the flame which shot from\r\nthe lady's eyes, and being no laggard, came forward with open arms, and\r\nconfronted her and said:--\"Madam, I am not unmindful that I must ever\r\nacknowledge that to you I owe my life, in regard of the peril whence you\r\nrescued me. If then there be any way in which I may pleasure you, churlish\r\nindeed were I not to devise it. So you may even embrace and kiss me to your\r\nheart's content, and I will embrace and kiss you with the best of good\r\nwills.\" There needed no further parley. The lady, all aflame with amorous\r\ndesire, forthwith threw herself into his arms, and straining him to her\r\nbosom with a thousand passionate embraces, gave and received a thousand\r\nkisses before they sought her chamber. There with all speed they went to\r\nbed, nor did day surprise them until again and again and in full measure\r\nthey had satisfied their desire. With the first streaks of dawn they rose,\r\nfor the lady was minded that none should surmise aught of the affair. So,\r\nhaving meanly habited Rinaldo, and replenished his purse, she enjoined him\r\nto keep the secret, shewed him the way to the castle, where he was to find\r\nhis servant, and let him out by the same postern by which he had entered.\r\nWhen it was broad day the gates were opened, and Rinaldo, passing himself\r\noff as a traveller from distant parts, entered the castle, and found his\r\nservant. Having put on the spare suit which was in his valise, he was about\r\nto mount the servant's horse, when, as if by miracle, there were brought\r\ninto the castle the three gentlemen of the road who had robbed him the\r\nevening before, having been taken a little while after for another offence.\r\nUpon their confession Rinaldo's horse was restored to him, as were also his\r\nclothes and money; so that he lost nothing except a pair of garters, of\r\nwhich the robbers knew not where they had bestowed them. Wherefore Rinaldo,\r\ngiving thanks to God and St. Julian, mounted his horse, and returned home\r\nsafe and sound, and on the morrow the three robbers kicked heels in the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL III.\r\n\r\n--\r\nThree young men squander their substance and are reduced to poverty. Their\r\nnephew, returning home a desperate man, falls in with an abbot, in whom he\r\ndiscovers the daughter of the King of England. She marries him, and he\r\nretrieves the losses and reestablishes the fortune of his uncles.\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe ladies marvelled to hear the adventures of Rinaldo d'Asti, praised his\r\ndevotion, and gave thanks to God and St. Julian for the succour lent him in\r\nhis extreme need. Nor, though the verdict was hardly outspoken, was the lady\r\ndeemed unwise to take the boon which God had sent her. So they tittered and\r\ntalked of her night of delight, while Pampinea, being seated by Filostrato,\r\nand surmising that her turn would, as it did, come next, was lost in\r\nmeditation on what she was to say. Roused from her reverie by the word of\r\nthe queen, she put on a cheerful courage, and thus began:--\r\n\r\nNoble ladies, discourse as we may of Fortune's handiwork, much still remains\r\nto be said if we but scan events aright, nor need we marvel thereat, if we\r\nbut duly consider that all matters, which we foolishly call our own, are in\r\nher hands and therefore subject, at her inscrutable will, to every variety\r\nof chance and change without any order therein by us discernible. Which is\r\nindeed signally manifest everywhere and all day long; yet, as 'tis our\r\nqueen's will that we speak thereof, perhaps 'twill not be unprofitable to\r\nyou, if, notwithstanding it has been the theme of some of the foregoing\r\nstories, I add to them another, which, I believe, should give you pleasure.\r\n\r\nThere was formerly in our city a knight, by name Messer Tedaldo, of the\r\nLamberti, according to some, or, as others say, of the Agolanti family,\r\nperhaps for no better reason than that the occupation of his sons was\r\nsimilar to that which always was and is the occupation of the Agolanti.\r\nHowever, without professing to determine which of the two houses he belonged\r\nto, I say, that he was in his day a very wealthy knight, and had three sons,\r\nthe eldest being by name Lamberto, the second Tedaldo, and the third\r\nAgolante. Fine, spirited young men were they all, though the eldest was not\r\nyet eighteen years old when their father, Messer Tedaldo, died very rich,\r\nleaving to them as his lawful heirs the whole of his property both movable\r\nand immovable. Finding themselves thus possessed of great wealth, both in\r\nmoney and in lands and chattels, they fell to spending without stint or\r\nrestraint, indulging their every desire, maintaining a great establishment,\r\nand a large and well-filled stable, besides dogs and hawks, keeping ever\r\nopen house, scattering largesses, jousting, and, not content with these and\r\nthe like pastimes proper to their condition, indulging every appetite\r\nnatural to their youth. They had not long followed this course of life\r\nbefore the cash left them by their father was exhausted; and, their rents\r\nnot sufficing to defray their expenditure, they began to sell and pledge\r\ntheir property, and disposing of it by degrees, one item to-day and another\r\nto-morrow, they hardly perceived that they were approaching the verge of\r\nruin, until poverty opened the eyes which wealth had fast sealed. So one day\r\nLamberto called his brothers to him, reminded them of the position of wealth\r\nand dignity which had been theirs and their father's before them, and shewed\r\nthem the poverty to which their extravagance had reduced them, and adjured\r\nthem most earnestly that, before their destitution was yet further manifest,\r\nthey should all three sell what little remained to them and depart thence;\r\nwhich accordingly they did. Without leave-taking, or any ceremony, they\r\nquitted Florence; nor did they rest until they had arrived in England and\r\nestablished themselves in a small house in London, where, by living with\r\nextreme parsimony and lending at exorbitant usances, they prospered so well\r\nthat in the course of a few years they amassed a fortune; and so, one by\r\none, they returned to Florence, purchased not a few of their former estates\r\nbesides many others, and married. The management of their affairs in\r\nEngland, where they continued their business of usurers, they left to a\r\nyoung nephew, Alessandro by name, while, heedless alike of the teaching of\r\nexperience and of marital and parental duty, they all three launched out at\r\nFlorence into more extravagant expenditure than before, and contracted debts\r\non all hands and to large amounts. This expenditure they were enabled for\r\nsome years to support by the remittances made by Alessandro, who, to his\r\ngreat profit, had lent money to the barons on the security of their castles\r\nand rents.\r\n\r\nWhile the three brothers thus continued to spend freely, and, when short of\r\nmoney, to borrow it, never doubting of help from England, it so happened\r\nthat, to the surprise of everybody, there broke out in England a war between\r\nthe King and his son, by which the whole island was divided into two camps;\r\nwhereby Alessandro lost all his mortgages, of the baronial castles and every\r\nother source of income whatsoever. However, in the daily expectation that\r\npeace would be concluded between the King and his son, Alessandro, hoping\r\nthat in that event all would be restored to him, principal and interest,\r\ntarried in the island; and the three brothers at Florence in no degree\r\nretrenched their extravagant expenditure, but went on borrowing from day to\r\nday. Several years thus passed; and, their hopes being frustrated, the three\r\nbrothers not only lost credit, but, being pressed for payment by their\r\ncreditors, were suddenly arrested, and, their property proving deficient,\r\nwere kept in prison for the balance, while their wives and little children\r\nwent into the country parts, or elsewhere, wretchedly equipped, and with no\r\nother prospect than to pass the rest of their days in destitution.\r\nAlessandro, meanwhile, seeing that the peace, which he had for several years\r\nawaited in England, did not come, and deeming that he would hazard his life\r\nto no purpose by tarrying longer in the country, made up his mind to return\r\nto Italy. He travelled at first altogether alone; but it so chanced that he\r\nleft Bruges at the same time with an abbot, habited in white, attended by a\r\nnumerous retinue, and preceded by a goodly baggage-train. Behind the abbot\r\nrode two greybeard knights, kinsmen of the King, in whom Alessandro\r\nrecognised acquaintances, and, making himself known to them, was readily\r\nreceived into their company. As thus they journeyed together, Alessandro\r\nsoftly asked them who the monks were that rode in front with so great a\r\ntrain, and whither they were bound. \"The foremost rider,\" replied one of the\r\nknights, \"is a young kinsman of ours, the newly-elected abbot of one of the\r\ngreatest abbeys of England,; and as he is not of legal age for such a\r\ndignity, we are going with him to Rome to obtain the Holy Father's\r\ndispensation and his confirmation in the office; but this is not a matter\r\nfor common talk.\" Now the new abbot, as lords are wont to do when they\r\ntravel, was sometimes in front, sometimes in rear of his train; and thus it\r\nhappened that, as he passed, he set eyes on Alessandro, who was still quite\r\nyoung, and very shapely and well-favoured, and as courteous, gracious and\r\ndebonair as e'er another. The abbot was marvellously taken with him at first\r\nsight, having never seen aught that pleased him so much, called him to his\r\nside, addressed him graciously, and asked him who he was, whence he came,\r\nand whither he was bound. Alessandro frankly told all about himself, and\r\nhaving thus answered the abbot's questions, placed himself at his service as\r\nfar as his small ability might extend. The abbot was struck by his easy flow\r\nof apt speech, and observing his bearing more closely, he made up his mind\r\nthat , albeit his occupation was base, he was nevertheless of gentle blood,\r\nwhich added no little to his interest in him; and being moved to compassion\r\nby his misfortunes, he gave him friendly consolation, bidding him be of good\r\nhope, that if he lived a worthy life, God would yet set him in a place no\r\nless or even more exalted than that whence Fortune had cast him down, and\r\nprayed him to be of his company as far as Tuscany, as both were going the\r\nsame way. Alessandro thanked him for his words of comfort, and professed\r\nhimself ready to obey his every command.\r\n\r\nSo fared on the abbot, his mind full of new ideas begotten by the sight of\r\nAlessandro, until some days later they came to a town which was none too\r\nwell provided with inns; and, as the abbot must needs put up there,\r\nAlessandro, who was well acquainted with one of the innkeepers, arranged\r\nthat the abbot should alight at his house, and procured him the least\r\ndiscomfortable quarters which it could afford. He thus became for the nonce\r\nthe abbot's seneschal, and being very expert for such office, managed\r\nexcellently, quartering the retinue in divers parts of the town. So the\r\nabbot supped, and, the night being far spent, all went to bed except\r\nAlessandro, who then asked the host where he might find quarters for the\r\nnight. \"In good sooth, I know not,\" replied the host; \"thou seest that every\r\nplace is occupied, and that I and my household must lie on the benches.\r\nHowever, in the abbot's chamber there are some corn-sacks. I can shew thee\r\nthe way thither, and lay a bit of a bed upon them, and there, an it like\r\nthee, thou mayst pass the night very well.\" \"How sayst thou?\" said\r\nAlessandro; \"in the abbot's chamber, which thou knowest is small, so that\r\nthere was not room for any of the monks to sleep there? Had I understood\r\nthis when the curtains were drawn, I would have quartered his monks on the\r\ncorn-sacks, and slept myself where the monks sleep.\" \"'Tis even so,\r\nhowever,\" replied the host, \"and thou canst, if thou wilt, find excellent\r\nquarters there: the abbot sleeps, the curtains are close drawn; I will go in\r\nsoftly and lay a small bed there, on which thou canst sleep.\" Alessandro,\r\nsatisfied that it might be managed without disturbing the abbot, accepted\r\nthe offer, and made his arrangements for passing the night as quietly as he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nThe abbot was not asleep; his mind being far too overwrought by certain\r\nnewly-awakened desires. He had heard what had passed between Alessandro and\r\nthe host, he had marked the place where Alessandro had lain down, and in the\r\ngreat gladness of his heart had begun thus to commune with himself:--\"God\r\nhas sent me the opportunity of gratifying my desire; if I let it pass,\r\nperchance it will be long before another such opportunity occurs.\" So, being\r\nminded by no means to let it slip, when all was quiet in the inn, he softly\r\ncalled Alessandro, and bade him lie down by his side. Alessandro made many\r\nexcuses, but ended by undressing and obeying whereupon the abbot laid a hand\r\non Alessandro's breast, and began to caress him just as amorous girls do\r\ntheir lovers; whereat Alessandro marvelled greatly, doubting the abbot was\r\nprompted to such caresses by a shameful love. Which the abbot speedily\r\ndivined, or else surmised from some movement on Alessandro's part, and,\r\nlaughing, threw off a chemise which she had upon her, and taking\r\nAlessandro's hand, laid it on her bosom, saying:--\"Alessandro, dismiss thy\r\nfoolish thought, feel here, and learn what I conceal.\" Alessandro obeyed,\r\nlaying a hand upon the abbot's bosom, where he encountered two little teats,\r\nround, firm and delicate, as they had been of ivory; whereby he at once knew\r\nthat 'twas a woman, and without awaiting further encouragement forthwith\r\nembraced her, and would have kissed her, when she said:--\"Before thou art\r\nmore familiar with me hearken to what I have to say to thee. As thou mayst\r\nperceive, I am no man, but a woman. Virgin I left my home, and was going to\r\nthe Pope to obtain his sanction for my marriage, when, as Fortune willed,\r\nwhether for thy gain or my loss, no sooner had I seen thee the other day,\r\nthan I burned for thee with such a flame of love as never yet had lady for\r\nany man. Wherefore I am minded to have thee for my husband rather than any\r\nother; so, if thou wilt not have me to wife, depart at once, and return to\r\nthine own place.\" Albeit he knew not who she was, Alessandro by the retinue\r\nwhich attended her conjectured that she must be noble and wealthy, and he\r\nsaw that she was very fair; so it was not long before he answered that, if\r\nsuch were her pleasure, it was very much to his liking. Whereupon she sate\r\nup, set a ring on his finger, and espoused him before a tiny picture of our\r\nLord; after which they embraced, and to their no small mutual satisfaction\r\nsolaced themselves for the rest of the night. At daybreak Alessandro rose,\r\nand by preconcert with the lady, left the chamber as he had entered it, so\r\nthat none knew where he had passed the night: then, blithe at heart beyond\r\nmeasure, he rejoined the abbot and his train, and so, resuming their\r\njourney, they after many days arrived at Rome. They had not been there more\r\nthan a few days, when the abbot, attended by the two knights and Alessandro,\r\nwaited on the Pope, whom, after making the due obeisance, he thus\r\naddressed:--\"Holy Father, as you must know better than any other, whoso\r\nintends to lead a true and honourable life ought, as far as may be, to shun\r\nall occasion of error; for which cause I, having a mind to live honourably,\r\ndid, the better to accomplish my purpose, assume the habit in which you see\r\nme, and depart by stealth from the court of my father, the King of England,\r\nwho was minded to marry me, young as you see me to be, to the aged King of\r\nScotland; and, carrying with me not a little of his treasure, set my face\r\nhitherward that your Holiness might bestow me in marriage. Nor was it the\r\nage of the King of Scotland that moved me to flee so much as fear lest the\r\nfrailty of my youth should, were I married to him, betray me to commit some\r\nbreach of divine law, and sully the honour of my father's royal blood. And\r\nas in this frame of mind I journeyed, God, who knows best what is meet for\r\nevery one, did, as I believe, of His mercy shew me him whom He is pleased to\r\nappoint me for my husband, even this young man\" (pointing to Alessandro)\r\n\"whom you see by my side, who for nobility of nature and bearing is a match\r\nfor any great lady, though the strain of his blood, perhaps, be not of royal\r\npurity. Him, therefore, have I chosen. Him will I have, and no other, no\r\nmatter what my father or any one else may think. And albeit the main purpose\r\nwith which I started is fulfilled, yet I have thought good to continue my\r\njourney, that I may visit the holy and venerable places which abound in this\r\ncity, and your Holiness, and that so in your presence, and by consequence in\r\nthe presence of others, I may renew my marriage-vow with Alessandro, whereof\r\nGod alone was witness. Wherefore I humbly pray you that God's will and mine\r\nmay be also yours, and that you pronounce your benison thereon, that\r\ntherewith, having the more firm assurance of the favour of Him, whose vicar\r\nyou are, we may both live together, and, when the time comes, die to God's\r\nglory and yours.\"\r\n\r\nAlessandro was filled with wonder and secret delight, when he heard that his\r\nwife was the daughter of the King of England; but greater still was the\r\nwonder of the two knights, and such their wrath that, had they been anywhere\r\nelse than in the Pope's presence, they would not have spared to affront\r\nAlessandro, and perhaps the lady too. The Pope, on his part, found matter\r\nenough for wonder as well in the lady's habit as in her choice; but, knowing\r\nthat he could not refuse, he consented to grant her request.\r\n\r\nHe therefore began by smoothing the ruffled tempers of the knights, and\r\nhaving reconciled them with the lady and Alessandro, proceeded to put\r\nmatters in train for the marriage. When the day appointed was come, he gave\r\na great reception, at which were assembled all the cardinals and many other\r\ngreat lords; to whom he presented the lady royally robed, and looking so\r\nfair and so gracious that she won, as she deserved, the praise of all, and\r\nlikewise Alessandro, splendidly arrayed, and bearing himself not a whit like\r\nthe young usurer but rather as one of royal blood, for which cause he\r\nreceived due honour from the knights. There, before the Pope himself, the\r\nmarriage-vows were solemnly renewed; and afterwards the marriage, which was\r\naccompanied by every circumstance that could add grace and splendour to the\r\nceremony, received the sanction of his benediction. Alessandro and the lady\r\non leaving Rome saw fit to visit Florence, whither fame had already wafted\r\nthe news, so that they were received by the citizens with every token of\r\nhonour. The lady set the three brothers at liberty, paying all their\r\ncreditors, and reinstated them and their wives in their several properties.\r\nSo, leaving gracious memories behind them, Alessandro and his lady,\r\naccompanied by Agolante, quitted Florence, and arriving at Paris were\r\nhonourably received by the King. The two knights went before them to\r\nEngland, and by their influence induced the King to restore the lady to his\r\nfavour, and receive her and his son-in-law with every circumstance of joy\r\nand honour. Alessandro he soon afterwards knighted with unwonted ceremony,\r\nand bestowed on him the earldom of Cornwall. And such was the Earl's\r\nconsequence and influence at court that he restored peace between father and\r\nson, thereby conferring a great boon on the island and gaining the love and\r\nesteem of all the people. Agolante, whom he knighted, recovered all the\r\noutstanding debts in full, and returned to Florence immensely rich. The Earl\r\npassed the rest of his days with his lady in great renown. Indeed there are\r\nthose who say, that with the help of his father-in-law he effected by his\r\npolicy and valour the conquest of Scotland, and was crowned king of that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL IV.\r\n\r\n--\r\nLandolfo Ruffolo is reduced to poverty, turns corsair, is captured by\r\nGenoese, is shipwrecked, escapes on a chest full of jewels, and, being cast\r\nashore at Corfu, is hospitably entertained by a woman, and returns home\r\nwealthy.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen Pampinea had brought her story to this glorious conclusion, Lauretta,\r\nwho sate next her, delayed not, but thus began:--\r\n\r\nMost gracious ladies, the potency of Fortune is never, methinks, more\r\nconspicuous than when she raises one, as in Pampinea's story we have seen\r\nher raise Alessandro, from abject misery to regal state. And such being the\r\nlimits which our theme henceforth imposes on our invention, I shall feel no\r\nshame to tell a story wherein reverses yet greater are compensated by a\r\nsequel somewhat less dazzling. Well I know that my story, being compared\r\nwith its predecessor, will therefore be followed with the less interest;\r\nbut, failing of necessity, I shall be excused.\r\n\r\nScarce any part of Italy is reputed so delectable as the sea-coast between\r\nReggio and Gaeta; and in particular the slope which overlooks the sea by\r\nSalerno, and which the dwellers there call the Slope of Amalfi, is studded\r\nwith little towns, gardens and fountains, and peopled by men as wealthy and\r\nenterprising in mercantile affairs as are anywhere to be found; in one of\r\nwhich towns, to wit, Ravello, rich as its inhabitants are to-day, there was\r\nformerly a merchant, who surpassed them all in wealth, Landolfo Ruffolo by\r\nname, who yet, not content with his wealth, but desiring to double it, came\r\nnigh to lose it all and his own life to boot. Know, then, that this man,\r\nhaving made his calculations, as merchants are wont, bought a great ship,\r\nwhich, entirely at his own expense, he loaded with divers sorts of\r\nmerchandise, and sailed to Cyprus. There he found several other ships, each\r\nladen with just such a cargo as his own, and was therefore fain to dispose\r\nof his goods at a very cheap rate, insomuch that he might almost as well\r\nhave thrown them away, and was brought to the verge of ruin. Mortified\r\nbeyond measure to find himself thus reduced in a short space of time from\r\nopulence to something like poverty, he was at his wits' end, and rather than\r\ngo home poor, having left home rich, he was minded to retrieve his losses by\r\npiracy or die in the attempt. So he sold his great ship, and with the price\r\nand the proceeds of the sale of his merchandise bought a light bark such as\r\ncorsairs use, and having excellently well equipped her with the armament and\r\nall things else meet for such service, took to scouring the seas as a rover,\r\npreying upon all folk alike, but more particularly upon the Turk.\r\n\r\nIn this enterprise he was more favoured by Fortune than in his trading\r\nadventures. A year had scarce gone by before he had taken so many ships from\r\nthe Turk that not only had he recovered the fortune which he had lost in\r\ntrade, but was well on the way to doubling it. The bitter memory of his late\r\nlosses taught him sobriety; he estimated his gains and found them ample; and\r\nlest he should have a second fall, he schooled himself to rest content with\r\nthem, and made up his mind to return home without attempting to add to them.\r\nShy of adventuring once more in trade, he refrained from investing them in\r\nany way, but shaped his course for home, carrying them with him in the very\r\nsame bark in which he had gotten them. He had already entered the\r\nArchipelago when one evening a contrary wind sprang up from the south-east,\r\nbringing with it a very heavy sea, in which his bark could not well have\r\nlived. He therefore steered her into a bay under the lee of one of the\r\nislets, and there determined to await better weather. As he lay there two\r\ngreat carracks of Genoa, homeward-bound from Constantinople, found, not\r\nwithout difficulty, shelter from the tempest in the same bay. The masters of\r\nthe carracks espied the bark, and found out to whom she belonged: the fame\r\nof Landolfo and his vast wealth had already reached them, and had excited\r\ntheir natural cupidity and rapacity. They therefore determined to capture\r\nthe bark, which lay without means of escape. Part of their men, well armed\r\nwith cross-bows and other weapons, they accordingly sent ashore, so posting\r\nthem that no one could leave the bark without being exposed to the bolts;\r\nthe rest took to their boats, and rowed up to the side of Landolfo's little\r\ncraft, which in a little time, with little trouble and no loss or risk, they\r\ncaptured with all aboard her. They then cleared the bark of all she\r\ncontained, allowing Landolfo, whom they set aboard one of the carracks, only\r\na pitiful doublet, and sunk her. Next day the wind shifted, and the carracks\r\nset sail on a westerly course, which they kept prosperously enough\r\nthroughout the day; but towards evening a tempest arose, and the sea became\r\nvery boisterous, so that the two ships were parted one from the other. And\r\nsuch was the fury of the gale that the ship, aboard which was poor, hapless\r\nLandolfo, was driven with prodigious force upon a shoal off the island of\r\nCephalonia, and broke up and went to pieces like so much glass dashed\r\nagainst a wall. Wherefore the unfortunate wretches that were aboard her,\r\nlaunched amid the floating merchandise and chests and planks with which the\r\nsea was strewn, did as men commonly do in such a case; and, though the night\r\nwas of the murkiest and the sea rose and fell in mountainous surges, such as\r\ncould swim sought to catch hold of whatever chance brought in their way.\r\nAmong whom hapless Landolfo, who only the day before had again and again\r\nprayed for death, rather than he should return home in such poverty, now,\r\nseeing death imminent, was afraid; and, like the rest, laid hold of the\r\nfirst plank that came to hand, in the hope that, if he could but avoid\r\nimmediate drowning, God would in some way aid his escape. Gripping the beam\r\nwith his legs as best he might, while wind and wave tossed him hither and\r\nthither, he contrived to keep himself afloat until broad day: when, looking\r\naround him, he discerned nothing but clouds and sea and a chest, which,\r\nborne by the wave, from time to time drew nigh him to his extreme terror,\r\nfor he apprehended it might strike against the plank, and do him a mischief;\r\nand ever, as it came near him, he pushed it off with all the little force he\r\nhad in his hand. But, as it happened, a sudden gust of wind swept down upon\r\nthe sea, and struck the chest with such force that it was driven against the\r\nplank on which Landolfo was, and upset it, and Landolfo went under the\r\nwaves. Swimming with an energy begotten rather of fear than of strength, he\r\nrose to the surface only to see the plank so far from him that, doubting he\r\ncould not reach it, he made for the chest, which was close at hand; and\r\nresting his breast upon the lid, he did what he could to keep it straight\r\nwith his arms. In this manner, tossed to and fro by the sea, without tasting\r\nfood, for not a morsel had he with him, and drinking more than he cared for,\r\nknowing not where he was, and seeing nothing but the sea, he remained all\r\nthat day, and the following night. The next day, as the will of God, or the\r\nforce of the wind so ordered, more like a sponge than aught else, but still\r\nwith both hands holding fast by the edges of the chest, as we see those do\r\nthat clutch aught to save themselves from drowning, he was at length borne\r\nto the coast of the island of Corfu, where by chance a poor woman was just\r\nthen scrubbing her kitchen-ware with sand and salt-water to make it shine.\r\nThe woman caught sight of him as he drifted shorewards, but making out only\r\na shapeless mass, was at first startled, and shrieked and drew back.\r\nLandolfo was scarce able to see, and uttered no sound, for his power of\r\nspeech was gone. However, when the sea brought him close to the shore, she\r\ndistinguished the shape of the chest, and gazing more intently, she first\r\nmade out the arms strained over the chest, and then discerned the face and\r\ndivined the truth. So, prompted by pity, she went out a little way into the\r\nsea, which was then calm, took him by the hair of the head, and drew him to\r\nland, chest and all. Then, not without difficulty she disengaged his hands\r\nfrom the chest, which she set on the head of a little girl, her daughter,\r\nthat was with her, carried him home like a little child, and set him in a\r\nbath, where she chafed and laved him with warm water, until, the vital heat\r\nand some part of the strength which he had lost being restored, she saw fit\r\nto take him out and regale him with some good wine and comfits. Thus for\r\nsome days she tended him as best she could, until he recovered his strength,\r\nand knew where he was. Then, in due time, the good woman, who had kept his\r\nchest safe, gave it back to him, and bade him try his fortune.\r\n\r\nLandolfo could not recall the chest, but took it when she brought it to him,\r\nthinking that, however slight its value, it must suffice for a few days'\r\ncharges. He found it very light, and quite lost hope; but when the good\r\nwoman was out of doors, he opened it to see what was inside, and found there\r\na great number of precious stones, some set, others unset. Having some\r\nknowledge of such matters, he saw at a glance that the stones were of great\r\nvalue; wherefore, feeling that he was still not forsaken by God, he praised\r\nHis name, and quite recovered heart. But, having in a brief space of time\r\nbeen twice shrewdly hit by the bolts of Fortune, he was apprehensive of a\r\nthird blow, and deemed it meet to use much circumspection in conveying his\r\ntreasure home; so he wrapped it up in rags as best he could, telling the\r\ngood woman that he had no more use for the chest, but she might keep it if\r\nshe wished, and give him a sack in exchange. This the good woman readily\r\ndid; and he, thanking her as heartily as he could for the service she had\r\nrendered him, threw his sack over his shoulders, and, taking ship, crossed\r\nto Brindisi. Thence he made his way by the coast as far as Trani, where he\r\nfound some of his townsfolk that were drapers, to whom he narrated all his\r\nadventures except that of the chest. They in charity gave him a suit of\r\nclothes, and lent him a horse and their escort as far as Ravello, whither,\r\nhe said, he was minded to return. There, thanking God for bringing him safe\r\nhome, he opened his sack, and examining its contents with more care than\r\nbefore, found the number, and fashion of the stones to be such that the sale\r\nof them at a moderate price, or even less, would leave him twice as rich as\r\nwhen he left Ravello. So, having disposed of his stones, he sent a large sum\r\nof money to Corfu in recompense of the service done him by the good woman\r\nwho had rescued him from the sea, and also to his friends at Trani who had\r\nfurnished him with the clothes; the residue he retained, and, making no more\r\nventures in trade, lived and died in honourable estate.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL V.\r\n\r\n--\r\nAndreuccio da Perugia comes to Naples to buy horses, meets with three\r\nserious adventures in one night, comes safe out of them all, and returns\r\nhome with a ruby.\r\n--\r\n\r\nLandolfo's find of stones, began Fiammetta, on whom the narration now fell,\r\nhas brought to my mind a story in which there are scarce fewer perilous\r\nscapes than in Lauretta's story, but with this difference: that, instead of\r\na course of perhaps several years, a single night, as you shall hear,\r\nsufficed for their occurrence.\r\n\r\nIn Perugia, by what I once gathered, there lived a young man, Andreuccio di\r\nPietro by name, a horse-dealer, who, having learnt that horses were to be\r\nhad cheap at Naples, put five hundred florins of gold in his purse, and in\r\ncompany with some other merchants went thither, never having been away from\r\nhome before. On his arrival at Naples, which was on a Sunday evening, about\r\nvespers, he learnt from his host that the fair would be held on the\r\nfollowing morning. Thither accordingly he then repaired, and looked at many\r\nhorses which pleased him much, and cheapening them more and more, and\r\nfailing to strike a bargain with any one, he from time to time, being raw\r\nand unwary, drew out his purse of florins in view of all that came and went,\r\nto shew that he meant business.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus chaffering, and after he had shewn his purse, there\r\nchanced to come by a Sicilian girl, fair as fair could be, but ready to\r\npleasure any man for a small consideration. He did not see her, but she saw\r\nhim and his purse, and forthwith said to herself:--\"Who would be in better\r\nluck than I if all those florins were mine?\" and so she passed on. With the\r\ngirl was an old woman, also a Sicilian, who, when she saw Andreuccio,\r\ndropped behind the girl, and ran towards him, making as if she would\r\ntenderly embrace him. The girl observing this said nothing, but stopped and\r\nwaited a little way off for the old woman to rejoin her. Andreuccio turned\r\nas the old woman came up, recognised her, and greeted her very cordially;\r\nbut time and place not permitting much converse, she left him, promising to\r\nvisit him at his inn; and he resumed his chaffering, but bought nothing that\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nHer old woman's intimate acquaintance with Andreuccio had no more escaped\r\nthe girl's notice than the contents of Andreuccio's purse; and with the view\r\nof devising, if possible, some way to make the money, either in whole or in\r\npart, her own, she began cautiously to ask the old woman, who and whence he\r\nwas, what he did there, and how she came to know him. The old woman gave her\r\nalmost as much and as circumstantial information touching Andreuccio and his\r\naffairs as he might have done himself, for she had lived a great while with\r\nhis father, first in Sicily, and afterwards at Perugia. She likewise told\r\nthe girl the name of his inn, and the purpose with which he had come to\r\nNaples. Thus fully armed with the names and all else that it was needful for\r\nher to know touching Andreuccio's kith and kin, the girl founded thereon her\r\nhopes of gratifying her cupidity, and forthwith devised a cunning stratagem\r\nto effect her purpose. Home she went, and gave the old woman work enough to\r\noccupy her all day, that she might not be able to visit Andreuccio; then,\r\nsummoning to her aid a little girl whom she had well trained for such\r\nservices, she sent her about vespers to the inn where Andreuccio lodged.\r\nArrived there, the little girl asked for Andreuccio of Andreuccio himself,\r\nwho chanced to be just outside the gate. On his answering that he was the\r\nman, she took him aside, and said:--\"Sir, a lady of this country, so please\r\nyou, would fain speak with you.\" Whereto he listened with all his ears, and\r\nhaving a great conceit of his person, made up his mind that the lady was in\r\nlove with him, as if there were ne'er another handsome fellow in Naples but\r\nhimself; so forthwith he replied, that he would wait on the lady, and asked\r\nwhere and when it would be her pleasure to speak with him. \"Sir,\" replied\r\nthe little girl, \"she expects you in her own house, if you be pleased to\r\ncome.\" \"Lead on then, I follow thee,\" said Andreuccio promptly, vouchsafing\r\nnever a word to any in the inn. So the little girl guided him to her\r\nmistress's house, which was situated in a quarter the character of which may\r\nbe inferred from its name, Evil Hole. Of this, however, he neither knew nor\r\nsuspected aught, but, supposing that the quarter was perfectly reputable and\r\nthat he was going to see a sweet lady, strode carelessly behind the little\r\ngirl into the house of her mistress, whom she summoned by calling out,\r\n\"Andreuccio is here;\" and Andreuccio then saw her advance to the head of the\r\nstairs to await his ascent. She was tall, still in the freshness of her\r\nyouth, very fair of face, and very richly and nobly clad. As Andreuccio\r\napproached, she descended three steps to meet him with open arms, and\r\nclasped him round the neck, but for a while stood silent as if from excess\r\nof tenderness; then, bursting into a flood of tears, she kissed his brow,\r\nand in slightly broken accents said:--\"O Andreuccio, welcome, welcome, my\r\nAndreuccio.\" Quite lost in wonder to be the recipient of such caresses,\r\nAndreuccio could only answer:--\"Madam, well met.\" Whereupon she took him by\r\nthe hand, led him up into her saloon, and thence without another word into\r\nher chamber, which exhaled throughout the blended fragrance of roses,\r\norange-blossoms and other perfumes. He observed a handsome curtained bed,\r\ndresses in plenty hanging, as is customary in that country, on pegs, and\r\nother appointments very fair and sumptuous; which sights, being strange to\r\nhim, confirmed his belief that he was in the house of no other than a great\r\nlady. They sate down side by side on a chest at the foot of the bed, and\r\nthus she began to speak:--\"Andreuccio, I cannot doubt that thou dost marvel\r\nboth at the caresses which I bestow upon thee, and at my tears, seeing that\r\nthou knowest me not, and, maybe, hast never so much as heard my name; wait\r\nbut a moment and thou shalt learn what perhaps will cause thee to marvel\r\nstill, more to wit, that I am thy sister; and I tell thee, that, since of\r\nGod's especial grace it is granted me to see one, albeit I would fain see\r\nall, of my brothers before I die, I shall not meet death, when the hour\r\ncomes, without consolation; but thou, perchance, hast never heard aught of\r\nthis; wherefore listen to what I shall say to thee. Pietro, my father and\r\nthine, as I suppose thou mayst have heard, dwelt a long while at Palermo,\r\nwhere his good heart and gracious bearing caused him to be (as he still is)\r\nmuch beloved by all that knew him; but by none was he loved so much as by a\r\ngentlewoman, afterwards my mother, then a widow, who, casting aside all\r\nrespect for her father and brothers, ay, and her honour, grew so intimate\r\nwith him that a child was born, which child am I thy sister, whom thou seest\r\nbefore thee. Shortly after my birth it so befell that Pietro must needs\r\nleave Palermo and return to Perugia, and I, his little daughter, was left\r\nbehind with my mother at Palermo; nor, so far as I have been able to learn,\r\ndid he ever again bestow a thought upon either of us. Wherefore--to say\r\nnothing of the love which he should have borne me, his daughter by no\r\nservant or woman of low degree--I should, were he not my father, gravely\r\ncensure the ingratitude which he shewed towards my mother, who, prompted by\r\na most loyal love, committed her fortune and herself to his keeping, without\r\nso much as knowing who he was. But to what end? The wrongs of long-ago are\r\nmuch more easily censured than redressed; enough that so it was. He left me\r\na little girl at Palermo, where, when I was grown to be almost as thou seest\r\nme, my mother, who was a rich lady, gave me in marriage to an honest\r\ngentleman of the Girgenti family, who for love of my mother and myself\r\nsettled in Palermo, and there, being a staunch Guelf, entered into\r\ncorrespondence with our King Charles;(1) which being discovered by King\r\nFrederic (2) before the time was ripe for action, we had perforce to flee\r\nfrom Sicily just when I was expecting to become the greatest lady that ever\r\nwas in the island. So, taking with us such few things as we could, few, I\r\nsay, in comparison of the abundance which we possessed, we bade adieu to our\r\nestates and palaces, and found a refuge in this country, and such favour\r\nwith King Charles that, in partial compensation for the losses which we had\r\nsustained on his account, he has granted us estates and houses and an ample\r\npension, which he regularly pays to my husband and thy brother-in-law, as\r\nthou mayst yet see. In this manner I live here but that I am blest with the\r\nsight of thee, I ascribe entirely to the mercy of God; and no thanks to\r\nthee, my sweet brother.\" So saying she embraced him again, and melting anew\r\ninto tears kissed his brow.\r\n\r\nThis story, so congruous, so consistent in every detail, came trippingly and\r\nwithout the least hesitancy from her tongue. Andreuccio remembered that his\r\nfather had indeed lived at Palermo; he knew by his own experience the ways\r\nof young folk, how prone they are to love; he saw her melt into tears, he\r\nfelt her embraces and sisterly kisses; and he took all she said for gospel.\r\nSo, when she had done, he answered:--\"Madam, it should not surprise you that\r\nI marvel, seeing that, in sooth, my father, for whatever cause, said never a\r\nword of you and your mother, or, if he did so, it came not to my knowledge,\r\nso that I knew no more of you than if you had not been; wherefore, the\r\nlonelier I am here, and the less hope I had of such good luck, the better\r\npleased I am to have found here my sister. And indeed, I know not any man,\r\nhowever exalted his station, who ought not to be well pleased to have such a\r\nsister; much more, then, I, who am but a petty merchant; but, I pray you,\r\nresolve me of one thing: how came you to know that I was here?\" Then\r\nanswered she:--\"'Twas told me this morning by a poor woman who is much about\r\nthe house, because, as she tells me, she was long in the service of our\r\nfather both at Palermo and at Perugia, and, but that it seemed more fitting\r\nthat thou shouldst come to see me at home than that I should visit thee at\r\nan inn, I had long ago sought thee out.\" She then began to inquire\r\nparticularly after all his kinsfolk by name, and Andreuccio, becoming ever\r\nmore firmly persuaded of that which it was least for his good to believe,\r\nanswered all her questions. Their conversation being thus prolonged and the\r\nheat great, she had Greek wine and sweetmeats brought in, and gave\r\nAndreuccio to drink; and when towards supper-time he made as if he would\r\nleave, she would in no wise suffer it; but, feigning to be very much vexed,\r\nshe embraced him, saying:--\"Alas! now 'tis plain how little thou carest for\r\nme: to think that thou art with thy sister, whom thou seest for the first\r\ntime, and in her own house, where thou shouldst have alighted on thine\r\narrival, and thou wouldst fain depart hence to go sup at an inn! Nay but,\r\nfor certain, thou shalt sup with me; and albeit, to my great regret, my\r\nhusband is not here, thou shalt see that I can do a lady's part in shewing\r\nthee honour.\" Andreuccio, not knowing what else to say, replied:--\"Sister, I\r\ncare for you with all a brother's affection; but if I go not, supper will\r\nawait me all the evening at the inn, and I shall justly be taxed with\r\ndiscourtesy.\" Then said she:--\"Blessed be God, there is even now in the\r\nhouse one by whom I can send word that they are not to expect thee at the\r\ninn, albeit thou wouldst far better discharge the debt of courtesy by\r\nsending word to thy friends, that they come here to sup; and then, if go\r\nthou must, you might all go in a body.\" Andreuccio replied, that he would\r\nhave none of his friends that evening, but since she would have him stay, he\r\nwould even do her the pleasure. She then made a shew of sending word to the\r\ninn that they should not expect him at dinner. Much more talk followed; and\r\nthen they sate down to a supper of many courses splendidly served, which she\r\ncunningly protracted until nightfall; nor, when they were risen from table,\r\nand Andreuccio was about to take his departure, would she by any means\r\nsuffer it, saying that Naples was no place to walk about in after dark,\r\nleast of all for a stranger, and that, as she had sent word to the inn that\r\nthey were not to expect him at supper, so she had done the like in regard of\r\nhis bed. Believing what she said, and being (in his false confidence)\r\noverjoyed to be with her, he stayed. After supper there was matter enough\r\nfor talk both various and prolonged; and, when the night was in a measure\r\nspent, she gave up her own chamber to Andreuccio, leaving him with a small\r\nboy to shew him aught that he might have need of, while she retired with her\r\nwomen to another chamber.\r\n\r\nIt was a very hot night , so, no sooner was Andreuccio alone than he\r\nstripped himself to his doublet, and drew off his stockings and laid them on\r\nthe bed's head; and nature demanding a discharge of the surplus weight which\r\nhe carried within him, he asked the lad where this might be done, and was\r\nshewn a door in a corner of the room, and told to go in there. Andreuccio,\r\nnothing doubting, did so, but, by ill luck, set his foot on a plank which\r\nwas detached from the joist at the further end, whereby down it went, and he\r\nwith it. By God's grace he took no hurt by the fall, though it was from some\r\nheight, beyond sousing himself from head to foot in the ordure which filled\r\nthe whole place, which, that you may the better understand what has been\r\nsaid, and that which is to follow, I will describe to you. A narrow and\r\nblind alley, such as we commonly see between two houses, was spanned by\r\nplanks supported by joists on either side, and on the planks was the stool;\r\nof which planks that which fell with Andreuccio was one. Now Andreuccio,\r\nfinding himself down there in the alley, fell to calling on the lad, who, as\r\nsoon as he heard him fall, had run off, and promptly let the lady know what\r\nhad happened. She hied forthwith to her chamber, and after a hasty search\r\nfound Andreuccio's clothes and the money in them, for he foolishly thought\r\nto secure himself against risk by carrying it always on his person, and thus\r\nbeing possessed of the prize for which she had played her ruse, passing\r\nherself off as the sister of a man of Perugia, whereas she was really of\r\nPalermo, she concerned herself no further with Andreuccio except to close\r\nwith all speed the door by which he had gone out when he fell. As the lad\r\ndid not answer, Andreuccio began to shout more loudly; but all to no\r\npurpose. Whereby his suspicions were aroused, and he began at last to\r\nperceive the trick that had been played upon him; so he climbed over a low\r\nwall that divided the alley from the street, and hied him to the door of the\r\nhouse, which he knew very well. There for a long while he stood shouting and\r\nbattering the door till it shook on its hinges; but all again to no purpose.\r\nNo doubt of his misadventure now lurking in his mind, he fell to bewailing\r\nhimself, saying:--\"Alas! in how brief a time have I lost five hundred\r\nflorins and a sister!\" with much more of the like sort. Then he recommenced\r\nbattering the door and shouting, to such a tune that not a few of the\r\nneighbours were roused, and finding the nuisance intolerable, got up; and\r\none of the lady's servant-girls presented herself at the window with a very\r\nsleepy air, and said angrily:--\"Who knocks below there?\" \"Oh!\" said\r\nAndreuccio, \"dost not know me? I am Andreuccio, Madam Fiordaliso's brother.\"\r\n\"Good man,\" she rejoined, \"if thou hast had too much to drink, go, sleep it\r\noff, and come back to-morrow. I know not Andreuccio, nor aught of the\r\nfantastic stuff thou pratest; prithee begone and be so good as to let us\r\nsleep in peace.\" \"How?\" said Andreuccio, \"dost not understand what I say?\r\nFor sure thou dost understand; but if Sicilian kinships are of such a sort\r\nthat folk forget them so soon, at least return me my clothes, which I left\r\nwithin, and right glad shall I be to be off.\" Half laughing, she rejoined:--\r\n\"Good man, methinks thou dost dream;\" and, so saying, she withdrew and\r\nclosed the window. Andreuccio by this time needed no further evidence of his\r\nwrongs; his wrath knew no bounds, and mortification well-nigh converted it\r\ninto frenzy; he was minded to exact by force what he had failed to obtain by\r\nentreaties; and so, arming himself with a large stone, he renewed his attack\r\nupon the door with fury, dealing much heavier blows than at first.\r\nWherefore, not a few of the neighbours, whom he had already roused from\r\ntheir beds, set him down as an ill-conditioned rogue, and his story as a\r\nmere fiction intended to annoy the good woman, (3) and resenting the din\r\nwhich he now made, came to their windows, just as, when a stranger dog makes\r\nhis appearance, all the dogs of the quarter will run to bark at him, and\r\ncalled out in chorus:--\"'Tis a gross affront to come at this time of night\r\nto the house of the good woman with this silly story. Prithee, good man, let\r\nus sleep in peace; begone in God's name; and if thou hast a score to settle\r\nwith her, come to-morrow, but a truce to thy pestering to-night.\"\r\n\r\nEmboldened, perhaps, by these words, a man who lurked within the house, the\r\ngood woman's bully, whom Andreuccio had as yet neither seen nor heard,\r\nshewed himself at the window, and said in a gruff voice and savage, menacing\r\ntone:--\"Who is below there?\" Andreuccio looked up in the direction of the\r\nvoice, and saw standing at the window, yawning and rubbing his eyes as if he\r\nhad just been roused from his bed, or at any rate from deep sleep, a fellow\r\nwith a black and matted beard, who, as far as Andreuccio's means of judging\r\nwent, bade fair to prove a most redoubtable champion. It was not without\r\nfear, therefore, that he replied:--\"I am a brother of the lady who is\r\nwithin.\" The bully did not wait for him to finish his sentence, but,\r\naddressing him in a much sterner tone than before, called out:--\"I know not\r\nwhy I come not down and give thee play with my cudgel, whilst thou givest me\r\nsign of life, ass, tedious driveller that thou must needs be, and drunken\r\nsot, thus to disturb our night's rest.\" Which said, he withdrew, and closed\r\nthe window. Some of the neighbours who best knew the bully's quality gave\r\nAndreuccio fair words. \"For God's sake,\" said they, \"good man, take thyself\r\noff, stay not here to be murdered. 'Twere best for thee to go.\" These\r\ncounsels, which seemed to be dictated by charity, reinforced the fear which\r\nthe voice and aspect of the bully had inspired in Andreuccio, who, thus\r\ndespairing of recovering his money and in the deepest of dumps, set his face\r\ntowards the quarter whence in the daytime he had blindly followed the little\r\ngirl, and began to make his way back to the inn. But so noisome was the\r\nstench which he emitted that he resolved to turn aside and take a bath in\r\nthe sea. So he bore leftward up a street called Ruga Catalana, and was on\r\nhis way towards the steep of the city, when by chance he saw two men coming\r\ntowards him, bearing a lantern, and fearing that they might be patrols or\r\nother men who might do him a mischief, he stole away and hid himself in a\r\ndismantled house to avoid them. The house, however, was presently entered by\r\nthe two men, just as if they had been guided thither; and one of them having\r\ndisburdened himself of some iron tools which he carried on his shoulder,\r\nthey both began to examine them, passing meanwhile divers comments upon\r\nthem. While they were thus occupied, \"What,\" said one, means this? Such a\r\nstench as never before did I smell the like. \"So saying, he raised the\r\nlantern a little; whereby they had a view of hapless Andreuccio, and asked\r\nin amazement:--\"Who is there?\" Whereupon Andreuccio was at first silent, but\r\nwhen they flashed the light close upon him, and asked him what he did there\r\nin such a filthy state, he told them all that had befallen him. Casting\r\nabout to fix the place where it occurred, they said one to another:--\"Of a\r\nsurety 'twas in the house of Scarabone Buttafuoco.\" Then said one, turning\r\nto Andreuccio:--\"Good man, albeit thou hast lost thy money, thou hast cause\r\nenough to praise God that thou hadst the luck to fall; for hadst thou not\r\nfallen, be sure that, no sooner wert thou asleep, than thou hadst been\r\nknocked on the head, and lost not only thy money but thy life. But what\r\nboots it now to bewail thee? Thou mightest as soon pluck a star from the\r\nfirmament as recover a single denier; nay, 'tis as much as thy life is worth\r\nif he do but hear that thou breathest a word of the affair.\"\r\n\r\nThe two men then held a short consultation, at the close of which they\r\nsaid:--\"Lo now; we are sorry for thee, and so we make thee a fair offer. If\r\nthou wilt join with us in a little matter which we have in hand, we doubt\r\nnot but thy share of the gain will greatly exceed what thou hast lost.\"\r\nAndreuccio, being now desperate, answered that he was ready to join them.\r\nNow Messer Filippo Minutolo, Archbishop of Naples, had that day been buried\r\nwith a ruby on his finger, worth over five hundred florins of gold, besides\r\nother ornaments of extreme value. The two men were minded to despoil the\r\nArchbishop of his fine trappings, and imparted their design to Andreuccio,\r\nwho, cupidity getting the better of caution, approved it; and so they all\r\nthree set forth. But as they were on their way to the cathedral, Andreuccio\r\ngave out so rank an odour that one said to the other:--\"Can we not contrive\r\nthat he somehow wash himself a little, that he stink not so shrewdly?\" \"Why\r\nyes,\" said the other, \"we are now close to a well, which is never without\r\nthe pulley and a large bucket; 'tis but a step thither, and we will wash him\r\nout of hand.\" Arrived at the well, they found that the rope was still there,\r\nbut the bucket had been removed; so they determined to attach him to the\r\nrope, and lower him into the well, there to wash himself, which done, he was\r\nto jerk the rope, and they would draw him up. Lowered accordingly he was;\r\nbut just as, now washen, he jerked the rope, it so happened that a company\r\nof patrols, being thirsty because 'twas a hot night and some rogue had led\r\nthem a pretty dance, came to the well to drink. The two men fled,\r\nunobserved, as soon as they caught sight of the newcomers, who, parched with\r\nthirst, laid aside their bucklers, arms and surcoats, and fell to hauling on\r\nthe rope, that it bore the bucket, full of water. When, therefore, they saw\r\nAndreuccio, as he neared the brink of the well, loose the rope and clutch\r\nthe brink with his hands, they were stricken with a sudden terror, and\r\nwithout uttering a word let go the rope, and took to flight with all the\r\nspeed they could make. Whereat Andreuccio marvelled mightily, and had he not\r\nkept a tight grip on the brink of the well, he would certainly have gone\r\nback to the bottom and hardly have escaped grievous hurt, or death. Still\r\ngreater was his astonishment, when, fairly landed on terra firma, he found\r\nthe patrols' arms lying there, which he knew had not been carried by his\r\ncomrades. He felt a vague dread, he knew not why; he bewailed once more his\r\nevil fortune; and without venturing to touch the arms, he left the well and\r\nwandered he knew not whither. As he went, however, he fell in with his two\r\ncomrades, now returning to draw him out of the well; who no sooner saw him\r\nthan in utter amazement they demanded who had hauled him up. Andreuccio\r\nanswered that he knew not, and then told them in detail how it had come\r\nabout, and what he had found beside the well. They laughed as they\r\napprehended the circumstances, and told him why they had fled, and who they\r\nwere that had hauled him up. Then without further parley, for it was now\r\nmidnight, they hied them to the cathedral. They had no difficulty in\r\nentering and finding the tomb, which was a magnificent structure of marble,\r\nand with their iron implements they raised the lid, albeit it was very\r\nheavy, to a height sufficient to allow a man to enter, and propped it up.\r\nThis done, a dialogue ensued. \"Who shall go in?\" said one. \"Not I,\" said the\r\nother. \"Nor I,\" rejoined his companion; \"let Andreuccio go in.\" \"That will\r\nnot I,\" said Andreuccio. Whereupon both turned upon him and said:--\"How?\r\nthou wilt not go in? By God, if thou goest not in, we will give thee that\r\nover the pate with one of these iron crowbars that thou shalt drop down\r\ndead.\" Terror-stricken, into the tomb Andreuccio went, saying to himself as\r\nhe did so:--\"These men will have me go in, that they may play a trick upon\r\nme: when I have handed everything up to them, and am sweating myself to get\r\nout of the tomb, they will be off about their business, and I shall be left,\r\nwith nothing for my pains.\" So he determined to make sure of his own part\r\nfirst; and bethinking him of the precious ring of which he had heard them\r\nspeak, as soon as he had completed the descent, he drew the ring off the\r\nArchbishop's finger, and put it on his own: he then handed up one by one the\r\ncrosier, mitre and gloves, and other of the Archbishop's trappings,\r\nstripping him to his shirt; which done, he told his comrades that there was\r\nnothing more. They insisted that the ring must be there, and bade him search\r\neverywhere. This he feigned to do, ejaculating from time to time that he\r\nfound it not; and thus he kept them a little while in suspense. But they,\r\nwho, were in their way as cunning as he, kept on exhorting him to make a\r\ncareful search, and, seizing their opportunity, withdrew the prop that\r\nsupported the lid of the tomb, and took to their heels, leaving him there a\r\nclose prisoner. You will readily conceive how Andreuccio behaved when he\r\nunderstood his situation. More than once he applied his head and shoulders\r\nto the lid and sought with might and main to heave it up; but all his\r\nefforts were fruitless; so that at last, overwhelmed with anguish he fell in\r\na swoon on the corpse of the Archbishop, and whether of the twain were the\r\nmore lifeless, Andreuccio or the Archbishop, 'twould have puzzled an\r\nobserver to determine.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to himself he burst into a torrent of tears, seeing now nothing\r\nin store for him but either to perish there of hunger and fetid odours\r\nbeside the corpse and among the worms, or, should the tomb be earlier\r\nopened, to be taken and hanged as a thief. These most lugubrious meditations\r\nwere interrupted by a sound of persons walking and talking in the church.\r\nThey were evidently a numerous company, and their purpose, as Andreuccio\r\nsurmised, was the very same with which he and his comrades had come thither:\r\nwhereby his terror was mightily increased. Presently the folk opened the\r\ntomb, and propped up the lid, and then fell to disputing as to who should go\r\nin. None was willing, and the contention was protracted; but at length one--\r\n'twas a priest--said:--\"Of what are ye afeared? Think ye to be eaten by him?\r\nNay, the dead eat not the living. I will go in myself.\" So saying he propped\r\nhis breast upon the edge of the lid, threw his head back, and thrust his\r\nlegs within, that he might go down feet foremost. On sight whereof\r\nAndreuccio started to his feet, and seizing hold of one of the priest's\r\nlegs, made as if he would drag him down; which caused the priest to utter a\r\nprodigious yell, and bundle himself out of the tomb with no small celerity.\r\nThe rest took to flight in a panic, as if a hundred thousand devils were at\r\ntheir heels. The tomb being thus left open, Andreuccio, the ring still on\r\nhis finger, spring out. The way by which he had entered the church served\r\nhim for egress, and roaming at random, he arrived towards daybreak at the\r\ncoast. Diverging thence he came by chance upon his inn, where he found that\r\nhis host and his comrades had been anxious about him all night. When he told\r\nthem all that had befallen him, they joined with the host in advising him to\r\nleave Naples at once. He accordingly did so, and returned to Perugia, having\r\ninvested in a ring the money with which he had intended to buy horses.\r\n\r\n(1) Charles II. of Naples, son of Charles of Anjou.\r\n(2) Frederic II. of Sicily, younger son of Peter III. of Arragon.\r\n(3) I. e. the bawd.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VI.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMadam Beritola loses two sons, is found with two kids on an island, goes\r\nthence to Lunigiana, where one of her sons takes service with her master,\r\nand lies with his daughter, for which he is put in prison. Sicily rebels\r\nagainst King Charles, the son is recognised by the mother, marries the\r\nmaster's daughter, and, his brother being discovered, is reinstated in great\r\nhonour.\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe ladies and the young men alike had many a hearty laugh over Fiammetta's\r\nnarrative of Andreuccio's adventures, which ended, Emilia, at the queen's\r\ncommand, thus began:--\r\n\r\nGrave and grievous are the vicissitudes with which Fortune makes us\r\nacquainted, and as discourse of such matter serves to awaken our minds,\r\nwhich are so readily lulled to sleep by her flatteries, I deem it worthy of\r\nattentive hearing by all, whether they enjoy her favour or endure her frown,\r\nin that it ministers counsel to the one sort and consolation to the other.\r\nWherefore, albeit great matters have preceded it, I mean to tell you a\r\nstory, not less true than touching, of adventures whereof the issue was\r\nindeed felicitous, but the antecedent bitterness so long drawn out that\r\nscarce can I believe that it was ever sweetened by ensuing happiness.\r\n\r\nDearest ladies, you must know that after the death of the Emperor Frederic\r\nII. the crown of Sicily passed to Manfred; whose favour was enjoyed in the\r\nhighest degree by a gentleman of Naples, Arrighetto Capece by name, who had\r\nto wife Madonna Beritola Caracciola, a fair and gracious lady, likewise a\r\nNeapolitan. Now when Manfred was conquered and slain by King Charles I. at\r\nBenevento, and the whole realm transferred its allegiance to the conqueror,\r\nArrighetto, who was then governor of Sicily, no sooner received the tidings\r\nthan he prepared for instant flight, knowing that little reliance was to be\r\nplaced on the fleeting faith of the Sicilians, and not being minded to\r\nbecome a subject of his master's enemy. But the Sicilians having\r\nintelligence of his plans, he and many other friends and servants of King\r\nManfred were surprised, taken prisoners and delivered over to King Charles,\r\nto whom the whole island was soon afterwards surrendered. In this signal\r\nreversal of the wonted course of things Madam Beritola, knowing not what was\r\nbecome of Arrighetto, and from the past ever auguring future evil, lest she\r\nshould suffer foul dishonour, abandoned all that she possessed, and with a\r\nson of, perhaps, eight years, Giusfredi by name, being also pregnant, fled\r\nin a boat to Lipari, where she gave birth to another male child, whom she\r\nnamed Outcast. Then with her sons and a hired nurse she took ship for\r\nNaples, intending there to rejoin her family. Events, however, fell out\r\notherwise than she expected; for by stress of weather the ship was carried\r\nout of her course to the desert island of Ponza, (1) where they put in to a\r\nlittle bay until such time as they might safely continue their voyage. Madam\r\nBeritola landed with the rest on the island, and, leaving them all, sought\r\nout a lonely and secluded spot, and there abandoned herself to melancholy\r\nbrooding on the loss of her dear Arrighetto. While thus she spent her days\r\nin solitary preoccupation with her grief it chanced that a galley of\r\ncorsairs swooped down upon the island, and, before either the mariners or\r\nany other folk were aware of their peril, made an easy capture of them all\r\nand sailed away; so that, when Madam Beritola, her wailing for that day\r\nended, returned, as was her wont, to the shore to solace herself with the\r\nsight of her sons, she found none there. At first she was lost in wonder,\r\nthen with a sudden suspicion of the truth she bent her eyes seaward, and\r\nthere saw the galley still at no great distance, towing the ship in her\r\nwake. Thus apprehending beyond all manner of doubt that she had lost her\r\nsons as well as her husband, and that, alone, desolate and destitute, she\r\nmight not hope, that any of her lost ones would ever be restored to her, she\r\nfell down on the shore in a swoon with the names of her husband and sons\r\nupon her lips. None was there to administer cold water or aught else that\r\nmight recall her truant powers; her animal spirits might even wander\r\nwhithersoever they would at their sweet will: strength, however, did at last\r\nreturn to her poor exhausted frame, and therewith tears and lamentations,\r\nas, plaintively repeating her sons' names, she roamed in quest of them from\r\ncavern to cavern. Long time she sought them thus; but when she saw that her\r\nlabour was in vain, and that night was closing in, hope, she knew not why,\r\nbegan to return, and with it some degree of anxiety on her own account.\r\nWherefore she left the shore and returned to the cavern where she had been\r\nwont to indulge her plaintive mood. She passed the night in no small fear\r\nand indescribable anguish; the new day came, and, as she had not supped, she\r\nwas fain after tierce to appease her hunger, as best she could, by a\r\nbreakfast of herbs: this done, she wept and began to ruminate on her future\r\nway of life. While thus engaged, she observed a she-goat come by and go into\r\nan adjacent cavern, and after a while come forth again and go into the wood:\r\nthus roused from her reverie she got up, went into the cavern from which the\r\nshe-goat had issued, and there saw two kids, which might have been born that\r\nvery day, and seemed to her the sweetest and the most delicious things in\r\nthe world: and, having, by reason of her recent delivery, milk still within\r\nher, she took them up tenderly, and set them to her breast. They, nothing\r\nloath, sucked at her teats as if she had been their own dam; and thenceforth\r\nmade no distinction between her and the dam. Which caused the lady to feel\r\nthat she had found company in the desert; and so, living on herbs and water,\r\nweeping as often as she bethought her of her husband and sons and her past\r\nlife, she disposed herself to live and die there, and became no less\r\nfamiliar with the she-goat than with her young.\r\n\r\nThe gentle lady thus leading the life of a wild creature, it chanced that\r\nafter some months stress of weather brought a Pisan ship to the very same\r\nbay in which she had landed. The ship lay there for several days, having on\r\nboard a gentleman, Currado de' Malespini by name (of the same family as the\r\nMarquis), who with his noble and most devout lady was returning home from a\r\npilgrimage, having visited all the holy places in the realm of Apulia. To\r\nbeguile the tedium of the sojourn Currado with his lady, some servants and\r\nhis dogs, set forth one day upon a tour through the island. As they neared\r\nthe place where Madam Beritola dwelt, Currado's dogs on view of the two\r\nkids, which, now of a fair size, were grazing, gave chase. The kids, pursued\r\nby the dogs, made straight for Madam Beritola's cavern. She, seeing what was\r\ntoward, started to her feet, caught up a stick, and drove the dogs back.\r\nCurrado and his lady coming up after the dogs, gazed on Madam Beritola, now\r\ntanned and lean and hairy, with wonder, which she more than reciprocated. At\r\nher request Currado called off the dogs; and then he and his lady besought\r\nher again and again to say who she was and what she did there. So she told\r\nthem all about herself, her rank, her misfortunes, and the savage life which\r\nshe was minded to lead. Currado, who had known Arrighetto Capece very well,\r\nwas moved to tears by compassion, and exhausted all his eloquence to induce\r\nher to change her mind, offering to escort her home, or to take her to live\r\nwith him in honourable estate as his sister until God should vouchsafe her\r\nkindlier fortune. The lady, declining all his offers, Currado left her with\r\nhis wife, whom he bade see that food was brought thither, and let Madam\r\nBeritola, who was all in rags, have one of her own dresses to wear, and do\r\nall that she could to persuade her to go with them. So the gentle lady\r\nstayed with Madam Beritola, and after condoling with her at large on her\r\nmisfortunes had food and clothing brought to her, and with the greatest\r\ndifficulty in the world prevailed upon her to eat and dress herself. At\r\nlast, after much beseeching, she induced her to depart from her oft-declared\r\nintention never to go where she might meet any that knew her, and accompany\r\nthem to Lunigiana, taking with her the two kids and the dam, which latter\r\nhad in the meantime returned, and to the gentle lady's great surprise had\r\ngreeted Madam Beritola with the utmost affection. So with the return of fair\r\nweather Madam Beritola, taking with her the dam and the two kids, embarked\r\nwith Currado and his lady on their ship, being called by them--for her true\r\nname was not to be known of all--Cavriuola; (2) and the wind holding fair,\r\nthey speedily reached the mouth of the Magra, (3) and landing hied them to\r\nCurrado's castle where Madam Beritola abode with Currado's lady in the\r\nquality of her maid, serving her well and faithfully, wearing widow's weeds,\r\nand feeding and tending her kids with assiduous and loving care.\r\n\r\nThe corsairs, who, not espying Madam Beritola, had left her at Ponza when\r\nthey took the ship on which she had come thither, had made a course to\r\nGenoa, taking with them all the other folk. On their arrival the owners of\r\nthe galley shared the booty, and so it happened that as part thereof Madam\r\nBeritola's nurse and her two boys fell to the lot of one Messer Guasparrino\r\nd'Oria, who sent all three to his house, being minded to keep them there as\r\ndomestic slaves. The nurse, beside herself with grief at the loss of her\r\nmistress and the woful plight in which she found herself and her two\r\ncharges, shed many a bitter tear. But, seeing that they were unavailing, and\r\nthat she and the boys were slaves together, she, having, for all her low\r\nestate, her share of wit and good sense, made it her first care to comfort\r\nthem; then, regardful of the condition to which they were reduced, she\r\nbethought her, that, if the lads were recognised, 'twould very likely be\r\ninjurious to them. So, still hoping that some time or another Fortune would\r\nchange her mood, and they be able, if living, to regain their lost estate,\r\nshe resolved to let none know who they were, until she saw a fitting\r\noccasion; and accordingly, whenever she was questioned thereof by any, she\r\ngave them out as her own children. The name of the elder she changed from\r\nGiusfredi to Giannotto di Procida; the name of the younger she did not think\r\nit worth while to change. She spared no pains to make Giusfredi understand\r\nthe reason why she had changed his name, and, the risk which he might run if\r\nhe were recognised. This she impressed upon him not once only but many\r\ntimes; and the boy, who was apt to learn, followed the instructions of the\r\nwise nurse with perfect exactitude.\r\n\r\nSo the two boys, ill clad and worse shod, continued with the nurse in Messer\r\nGuasparrino's house for two years, patiently performing all kinds of menial\r\noffices. But Giannotto, being now sixteen years old, and of a spirit that\r\nconsorted ill with servitude, brooked not the baseness of his lot, and\r\ndismissed himself from Messer Guasparrino's service by getting aboard a\r\ngalley bound for Alexandria, and travelled far and wide, and fared never the\r\nbetter. In the course of his wanderings he learned that his father, whom he\r\nhad supposed to be dead, was still living, but kept in prison under watch\r\nand ward by King Charles. He was grown a tall handsome young man, when,\r\nperhaps three or four years after he had given Messer Guasparrino the slip,\r\nweary of roaming and all but despairing of his fortune, he came to\r\nLunigiana, and by chance took service with Currado Malespini, who found him\r\nhandy, and was well-pleased with him. His mother, who was in attendance on\r\nCurrado's lady, he seldom saw, and never recognised her, nor she him; so\r\nmuch had time changed both from their former aspect since they last met.\r\nWhile Giannotto was thus in the service of Currado, it fell out by the death\r\nof Niccolo da Grignano that his widow, Spina, Currado's daughter, returned\r\nto her father's house. Very fair she was and loveable, her age not more than\r\nsixteen years, and so it was that she saw Giannotto with favour, and he her,\r\nand both fell ardently in love with one another. Their passion was early\r\ngratified; but several months elapsed before any detected its existence.\r\nWherefore, growing overbold, they began to dispense with the precautions\r\nwhich such an affair demanded. So one day, as they walked with others\r\nthrough a wood, where the trees grew fair and close, the girl and Giannotto\r\nleft the rest of the company some distance behind, and, thinking that they\r\nwere well in advance, found a fair pleasaunce girt in with trees and\r\ncarpeted with abundance of grass and flowers, and fell to solacing\r\nthemselves after the manner of lovers. Long time they thus dallied, though\r\nsuch was their delight that all too brief it seemed to them, and so it\r\nbefell that they were surprised first by the girl's mother and then by\r\nCurrado. Pained beyond measure by what he had seen, Currado, without\r\nassigning any cause, had them both arrested by three of his servants and\r\ntaken in chains to one of his castles; where in a frenzy of passionate wrath\r\nhe left them, resolved to put them to an ignominious death. The girl's\r\nmother was also very angry, and deemed her daughter's fall deserving of the\r\nmost rigorous chastisement, but, when by one of Currado's chance words she\r\ndivined the doom which he destined for the guilty pair, she could not\r\nreconcile herself to it, and hasted to intercede with her angry husband,\r\nbeseeching him to refrain the impetuous wrath which would hurry him in his\r\nold age to murder his daughter and imbrue his hands in the blood of his\r\nservant, and vent it in some other way, as by close confinement and duress,\r\nwhereby the culprits should be brought to repent them of their fault in\r\ntears. Thus, and with much more to the like effect, the devout lady urged\r\nher suit, and at length prevailed upon her husband to abandon his murderous\r\ndesign. Wherefore, he commanded that the pair should be confined in separate\r\nprisons, and closely guarded, and kept short of food and in sore discomfort,\r\nuntil further order; which was accordingly done; and the life which the\r\ncaptives led, their endless tears, their fasts of inordinate duration, may\r\nbe readily imagined.\r\n\r\nGiannotto and Spina had languished in this sorry plight for full a year,\r\nentirely ignored by Currado, when in concert with Messer Gian di Procida,\r\nKing Peter of Arragon raised a rebellion (4) in the island of Sicily, and\r\nwrested it from King Charles, whereat Currado, being a Ghibelline, was\r\noverjoyed. Hearing the tidings from one of his warders, Giannotto heaved a\r\ngreat sigh, and said:--\"Alas, fourteen years have I been a wanderer upon the\r\nface of the earth, looking for no other than this very event; and now, that\r\nmy hopes of happiness may be for ever frustrate, it has come to pass only to\r\nfind me in prison, whence I may never think to issue alive.\" \"How?\" said the\r\nwarder; \"what signify to thee these doings of these mighty monarchs? What\r\npart hadst thou in Sicily?\" Giannotto answered:--\"'Tis as if my heart were\r\nbreaking when I bethink me of my father and what part he had in Sicily. I\r\nwas but a little lad when I fled the island, but yet I remember him as its\r\ngovernor in the time of King Manfred.\" \"And who then was thy father?\"\r\ndemanded the warder. \"His name,\" rejoined Giannotto, \"I need no longer\r\nscruple to disclose, seeing that I find myself in the very strait which I\r\nhoped to avoid by concealing it. He was and still is, if he live, Arrighetto\r\nCapece; and my name is not Giannotto but Giusfredi; and I doubt not but,\r\nwere I once free, and back in Sicily, I might yet hold a very honourable\r\nposition in the island.\"\r\n\r\nThe worthy man asked no more questions, but, as soon as he found\r\nopportunity, told what he had learned to Currado, who, albeit he made light\r\nof it in the warder's presence, repaired to Madam Beritola, and asked her in\r\na pleasant manner, whether she had had by Arrighetto a son named Giusfredi.\r\nThe lady answered, in tears, that, if the elder of her two sons were living,\r\nsuch would be his name, and his age twenty-two years. This inclined Currado\r\nto think that Giannotto and Giusfredi were indeed one and the same; and it\r\noccurred to him, that, if so it were, he might at once shew himself most\r\nmerciful and blot out his daughter's shame and his own by giving her to him\r\nin marriage; wherefore he sent for Giannotto privily, and questioned him in\r\ndetail touching his past life. And finding by indubitable evidence that he\r\nwas indeed Giusfredi, son of Arrighetto Capece, he said to him:--\"Giannotto,\r\nthou knowest the wrong which thou hast done me in the person of my daughter,\r\nwhat and how great it is, seeing that I used thee well and kindly, and thou\r\nshouldst therefore, like a good servant, have shewn thyself jealous of my\r\nhonour, and zealous in my interest; and many there are who, hadst thou\r\ntreated them as thou hast treated me, would have caused thee to die an\r\nignominious death; which my clemency would not brook. But now, as it is even\r\nso as thou sayst, and thou art of gentle blood by both thy parents, I am\r\nminded to put an end to thy sufferings as soon as thou wilt, releasing thee\r\nfrom the captivity in which thou languishest, and setting thee in a happy\r\nplace, and reinstating at once thy honour and my own. Thy intimacy with\r\nSpina--albeit, shameful to both--was yet prompted by love. Spina, as thou\r\nknowest, is a widow, and her dower is ample and secure. What her breeding\r\nis, and her father's and her mother's, thou knowest: of thy present\r\ncondition I say nought. Wherefore, when thou wilt, I am consenting, that,\r\nhaving been with dishonour thy friend, she become with honour thy wife, and\r\nthat, so long as it seem good to thee, thou tarry here with her and me as my\r\nson.\"\r\n\r\nCaptivity had wasted Giannotto's flesh, but had in no degree impaired the\r\ngenerosity of spirit which he derived from his ancestry, or the\r\nwhole-hearted love which he bore his lady. So, albeit he ardently desired\r\nthat which Currado offered, and knew that he was in Currado's power, yet,\r\neven as his magnanimity prompted, so, unswervingly, he made answer:--\r\n\"Currado, neither ambition nor cupidity nor aught else did ever beguile me\r\nto any treacherous machination against either thy person or thy property.\r\nThy daughter I loved, and love and shall ever love, because I deem her\r\nworthy of my love, and, if I dealt with her after a fashion which to the\r\nmechanic mind seems hardly honourable, I did but commit that fault which is\r\never congenial to youth, which can never be eradicated so long as youth\r\ncontinues, and which, if the aged would but remember that they were once\r\nyoung and would measure the delinquencies of others by their own and their\r\nown by those of others, would not be deemed so grave as thou and many others\r\ndepict it; and what I did, I did as a friend, not as an enemy. That which\r\nthou offerest I have ever desired and should long ago have sought, had I\r\nsupposed that thou wouldst grant it, and 'twill be the more grateful to me\r\nin proportion to the depth of my despair. But if thy intent be not such, as\r\nthy words import, feed me not with vain hopes, but send me back to prison\r\nthere to suffer whatever thou mayst be pleased to inflict; nor doubt that\r\neven as I love Spina, so for love of her shall I ever love thee, though thou\r\ndo thy worst, and still hold thee in reverent regard.\r\n\r\nCurrado marvelled to hear him thus speak, and being assured of his\r\nmagnanimity and the fervour of his love, held him the more dear; wherefore\r\nhe rose, embraced and kissed him, and without further delay bade privily\r\nbring thither Spina, who left her prison wasted and wan and weak, and so\r\nchanged that she seemed almost another woman than of yore, even as Giannotto\r\nwas scarce his former self. Then and there in Currado's presence they\r\nplighted their troth according to our custom of espousals; and some days\r\nafterwards Currado, having in the meantime provided all things meet for\r\ntheir convenience and solace, yet so as that none should surmise what had\r\nhappened, deemed it now time to gladden their mothers with the news. So he\r\nsent for his lady and Cavriuola, and thus, addressing Cavriuola, he\r\nspoke:--\"What would you say, madam, were I to restore you your elder son as\r\nthe husband of one of my daughters?\" Cavriuola answered:--\"I should say,\r\nthat, were it possible for you to strengthen the bond which attaches me to\r\nyou, then assuredly you had so done, in that you restored to me that which I\r\ncherish more tenderly than myself, and in such a guise as in some measure to\r\nrenew within me the hope which I had lost: more I could not say.\" And so,\r\nweeping, she was silent. Then, turning to his lady, Currado said:--\"And\r\nthou, madam, what wouldst thou think if I were to present thee with such a\r\nson-in-law?\" \"A son-in-law,\" she answered, \"that was not of gentle blood,\r\nbut a mere churl, so he pleased you, would well content me.\" \"So!\" returned\r\nCurrado; \"I hope within a few days to gladden the hearts of both of you.\"\r\n\r\nHe waited only until the two young folk had recovered their wonted mien, and\r\nwere clad in a manner befitting their rank. Then, addressing Giusfredi, he\r\nsaid:--\"Would it not add to thy joy to see thy mother here?\" \"I dare not\r\nhope,\" returned Giusfredi,\" that she has survived calamities and sufferings\r\nsuch as hers; but were it so, great indeed would be my joy, and none the\r\nless that by her counsel I might be aided to the recovery (in great measure)\r\nof my lost heritage in Sicily.\" Whereupon Currado caused both the ladies to\r\ncome thither, and presented to them the bride. The gladness with which they\r\nboth greeted her was a wonder to behold, and no less great was their wonder\r\nat the benign inspiration that had prompted Currado to unite her in wedlock\r\nwith Giannotto, whom Currado's words caused Madam Beritola to survey with\r\nsome attention. A hidden spring of memory was thus touched; she recognised\r\nin the man the lineaments of her boy, and awaiting no further evidence she\r\nran with open arms and threw herself upon his neck. No word did she utter,\r\nfor very excess of maternal tenderness and joy; but, every avenue of sense\r\nclosed, she fell as if bereft of life within her son's embrace. Giannotto,\r\nwho had often seen her in the castle and never recognised her, marvelled not\r\na little, but nevertheless it at once flashed upon him that 'twas his\r\nmother, and blaming himself for his past inadvertence he took her in his\r\narms and wept and tenderly kissed her. With gentle solicitude Currado's lady\r\nand Spina came to her aid, and restored her suspended animation with cold\r\nwater and other remedies. She then with many tender and endearing words\r\nkissed him a thousand times or more, which tokens of her love he received\r\nwith a look of reverential acknowledgment. Thrice, nay a fourth time were\r\nthese glad and gracious greetings exchanged, and joyful indeed were they\r\nthat witnessed them, and hearkened while mother and son compared their past\r\nadventures. Then Currado, who had already announced his new alliance to his\r\nfriends, and received their felicitations proceeded to give order for the\r\ncelebration of the event with all becoming gaiety and splendour. As he did\r\nso, Giusfredi said to him:--\"Currado, you have long given my mother\r\nhonourable entertainment, and on me you have conferred many boons;\r\nwherefore, that you may fill up the measure of your kindness, 'tis now my\r\nprayer that you be pleased to gladden my mother and my marriage feast and me\r\nwith the presence of my brother, now in servitude in the house of Messer\r\nGuasparrino d'Oria, who, as I have already told you, made prize of both him\r\nand me; and that then you send some one to Sicily, who shall make himself\r\nthoroughly acquainted with the circumstances and condition of the country,\r\nand find out how it has fared with my father Arrighetto, whether he be alive\r\nor dead, and if alive, in what circumstances, and being thus fully informed,\r\nreturn to us with the tidings.\" Currado assented, and forthwith sent most\r\ntrusty agents both to Genoa and to Sicily. So in due time an envoy arrived\r\nat Genoa, and made instant suit to Guasparrino on Currado's part for the\r\nsurrender of Outcast and the nurse, setting forth in detail all that had\r\npassed between Currado and Giusfredi and his mother. Whereat Messer\r\nGuasparrino was mightily astonished, and said:--\"Of a surety there is nought\r\nthat, being able, I would not do to pleasure Currado; and, true it is that I\r\nhave had in my house for these fourteen years the boy whom thou dost now\r\ndemand of me, and his mother, and gladly will I surrender them; but tell\r\nCurrado from me to beware of excessive credulity, and to put no faith in the\r\nidle tales of Giannotto, or Giusfredi, as thou sayst he calls himself, who\r\nis by no means so guileless as he supposes.\"\r\n\r\nThen, having provided for the honourable entertainment of the worthy envoy,\r\nhe sent privily for the nurse, and cautiously sounded her as to the affair.\r\nThe nurse had heard of the revolt of Sicily, and had learned that Arrighetto\r\nwas still alive. She therefore banished fear, and told Messer Guasparrino\r\nthe whole story, and explained to him the reasons why she had acted as she\r\nhad done. Finding that what she said accorded very well with what he had\r\nlearned from Currado's envoy, he inclined to credit the story, and most\r\nastutely probing the matter in divers ways, and always finding fresh grounds\r\nfor confidence, he reproached himself for the sorry manner in which he had\r\ntreated the boy, and by way of amends gave him one of his own daughters, a\r\nbeautiful girl of eleven years, to wife with a dowry suited to Arrighetto's\r\nrank, and celebrated their nuptials with great festivity, He then brought\r\nthe boy and girl, Currado's envoy, and the nurse in a well-armed galliot to\r\nLerici, being there met by Currado, who had a castle not far off, where\r\ngreat preparations had been made for their entertainment: and thither\r\naccordingly he went with his whole company. What cheer the mother had of her\r\nson, the brothers of one another, and all the three of the faithful nurse;\r\nwhat cheer Messer Guasparrino and his daughter had of all, and all of them,\r\nand what cheer all had of Currado and his lady and their sons and their\r\nfriends, words may not describe; wherefore, my ladies, I leave it to your\r\nimagination. And that their joy might be full, God, who, when He gives,\r\ngives most abundantly, added the glad tidings that Arrighetto Capece was\r\nalive and prosperous. For, when in the best of spirits the ladies and\r\ngentlemen had sat them down to feast, and they were yet at the first course,\r\nthe envoy from Sicily arrived, and among other matters reported, that, no\r\nsooner had the insurrection broken out in the island than the people hied\r\nthem in hot haste to the prison where Arrighetto was kept in confinement by\r\nKing Charles, and despatching the guards, brought him forth, and knowing him\r\nto be a capital enemy to King Charles made him their captain, and under his\r\ncommand fell upon and massacred the French. Whereby he had won the highest\r\nplace in the favour of King Peter, who had granted him restitution of all\r\nhis estates and honours, so that he was now both prosperous and mighty. The\r\nenvoy added that Arrighetto had received him with every token of honour, had\r\nmanifested the utmost delight on hearing of his lady and son, of whom no\r\ntidings had reached him since his arrest, and had sent, to bring them home,\r\na brigantine with some gentlemen aboard, whose arrival might hourly be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nThe envoy, and the good news which he brought, were heartily welcome; and\r\npresently Currado, with some of his friends, encountered the gentlemen who\r\ncame for Madam Beritola and Giusfredi, and saluting them cordially invited\r\nthem to his feast, which was not yet half done. Joy unheard of was depicted\r\non the faces of the lady, of Giusfredi, and of all the rest as they greeted\r\nthem; nor did they on their part take their places at the table before, as\r\nbest they might, they had conveyed to Currado and his lady Arrighetto's\r\ngreetings and grateful acknowledgments of the honour which they had\r\nconferred upon his lady and his son, and had placed Arrighetto, to the\r\nuttermost of his power, entirely at their service. Then, turning to Messer\r\nGuasparrino, of whose kindness Arrighetto surmised nothing, they said that\r\nthey were very sure that, when he learned the boon which Outcast had\r\nreceived at his hands, he would pay him the like and an even greater tribute\r\nof gratitude. This speech ended, they feasted most joyously with the brides\r\nand bridegrooms. So passed the day, the first of many which Currado devoted\r\nto honouring his son-in-law and his other intimates, both kinsfolk and\r\nfriends. The time of festivity ended, Madam Beritola and Giusfredi and the\r\nrest felt that they must leave: so, taking Spina with them, they parted, not\r\nwithout many tears, from Currado and his lady and Guasparrino, and went\r\naboard the brigantine, which, wafted by a prosperous wind, soon brought them\r\nto Sicily. At Palermo they were met by Arrighetto, who received them all,\r\nladies and sons alike, with such cheer as it were vain to attempt to\r\ndescribe. There it is believed that they all lived long and happily and in\r\namity with God, being not unmindful of the blessings which He had conferred\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\n(1) The largest, now inhabited, of a group of islets in the Gulf of Gaeta.\r\n(2) I.e. she-goat.\r\n(3) Between Liguria and Tuscany.\r\n(4) The Sicilian Vespers, Easter, 1282.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VII.\r\n\r\n--\r\nThe Soldan of Babylon sends one of his daughters overseas, designing to\r\nmarry her to the King of Algarve. By divers adventures she comes in the\r\nspace of four years into the hands of nine men in divers places. At last she\r\nis restored to her father, whom she quits again in the guise of a virgin,\r\nand, as was at first intended, is married to the King of Algarve.\r\n--\r\n\r\nHad Emilia's story but lasted a little longer, the young ladies would\r\nperhaps have been moved to tears, so great was the sympathy which they felt\r\nfor Madam Beritola in her various fortunes. But now that it was ended, the\r\nQueen bade Pamfilo follow suit; and he, than whom none was more obedient,\r\nthus began:--\r\n\r\nHardly, gracious ladies, is it given to us to know that which makes for our\r\ngood; insomuch that, as has been observable in a multitude of instances,\r\nmany, deeming that the acquisition of great riches would ensure them an easy\r\nand tranquil existence, have not only besought them of God in prayer, but\r\nhave sought them with such ardour that they have spared no pains and shrunk\r\nfrom no danger in the quest, and have attained their end only to lose, at\r\nthe hands of some one covetous of their vast inheritance, a life with which\r\nbefore the days of their prosperity they were well content. Others, whose\r\ncourse, perilous with a thousand battles, stained with the blood of their\r\nbrothers and their friends, has raised them from base to regal estate, have\r\nfound in place of the felicity they expected an infinity of cares and fears,\r\nand have proved by experience that a chalice may be poisoned, though it be\r\nof gold, and set on the table of a king. Many have most ardently desired\r\nbeauty and strength and other advantages of person, and have only been\r\ntaught their error by the death or dolorous life which these very advantages\r\nentailed upon them. And so, not to instance each particular human desire, I\r\nsay, in sum, that there is none of, them that men may indulge in full\r\nconfidence as exempt from the chances and changes of fortune; wherefore, if\r\nwe would act rightly, we ought to school ourselves to take and be content\r\nwith that which He gives us, who alone knows and can afford us that of which\r\nwe have need. But, divers as are the aberrations of desire to which men are\r\nprone, so, gracious ladies, there is one to which you are especially liable,\r\nin that you are unduly solicitous of beauty, insomuch, that, not content\r\nwith the charms which nature has allotted you, you endeavour to enhance them\r\nwith wondrous ingenuity of art; wherefore I am minded to make you acquainted\r\nwith the coil of misadventures in which her beauty involved a fair Saracen,\r\nwho in the course of, perhaps, four years was wedded nine several times.\r\n\r\nThere was of yore a Soldan of Babylon (1), by name of Beminedab, who in his\r\nday had cause enough to be well content with his luck. Many children male\r\nand female had he, and among them a daughter, Alatiel by name, who by common\r\nconsent of all that saw her was the most beautiful woman then to be found in\r\nthe world. Now the Soldan, having been signally aided by the King of Algarve\r\n(2) in inflicting a great defeat upon a host of Arabs that had attacked him,\r\nhad at his instance and by way of special favour given Alatiel to the King\r\nto wife; wherefore, with an honourable escort of gentlemen and ladies most\r\nnobly and richly equipped, he placed her aboard a well-armed, well-furnished\r\nship, and, commending her to God, sped her on her journey. The mariners, as\r\nsoon as the weather was favourable, hoisted sail, and for some days after\r\ntheir departure from Alexandria had a prosperous voyage; but when they had\r\npassed Sardinia, and were beginning to think that they were nearing their\r\njourney's end, they were caught one day between divers cross winds, each\r\nblowing with extreme fury, whereby the ship laboured so sorely that not only\r\nthe lady but the seamen from time to time gave themselves up for lost. But\r\nstill, most manfully and skilfully they struggled might and main with the\r\ntempest, which, ever waxing rather than waning, buffeted them for two days\r\nwith immense unintermittent surges; and being not far from the island of\r\nMajorca, as the third night began to close in, wrapt in clouds and mist and\r\nthick darkness, so that they saw neither the sky nor aught else, nor by any\r\nnautical skill might conjecture where they were, they felt the ship's\r\ntimbers part. Wherefore, seeing no way to save the ship, each thought only\r\nhow best to save himself, and, a boat being thrown out, the masters first,\r\nand then the men, one by one, though the first-comers sought with knives in\r\ntheir hands to bar the passage of the rest, all, rather than remain in the\r\nleaky ship, crowded into it, and there found the death which they hoped to\r\nescape. For the boat, being in such stress of weather, and with such a\r\nburden quite unmanageable, went under, and all aboard her perished; whereas\r\nthe ship, leaky though she was, and all but full of water, yet, driven by\r\nthe fury of the tempest, was hurled with prodigious velocity upon the shore\r\nof the island of Majorca, and struck it with such force as to embed herself\r\nin the sand, perhaps a stone's throw from terra firma, where she remained\r\nall night beaten and washed by the sea, but no more to be moved by the\r\nutmost violence of the gale. None had remained aboard her but the lady and\r\nher women, whom the malice of the elements and their fears had brought to\r\nthe verge of death. When it was broad day and the storm was somewhat abated,\r\nthe lady, half dead, raised her head, and in faltering accents began to call\r\nfirst one and then another of her servants. She called in vain, however; for\r\nthose whom she called were too far off to hear. Great indeed was her wonder\r\nand fear to find herself thus without sight of human face or sound of other\r\nvoice than her own; but, struggling to her feet as best she might, she\r\nlooked about her, and saw the ladies that were of her escort, and the other\r\nwomen, all prostrate on the deck; so, after calling them one by one, she\r\nbegan at length to touch them, and finding few that shewed sign of life, for\r\nindeed, between grievous sea-sickness and fear, they had little life left,\r\nshe grew more terrified than before. However, being in sore need of counsel,\r\nall alone as she was, and without knowledge or means of learning where she\r\nwas, she at last induced such as had life in them to get upon their feet,\r\nwith whom, as none knew where the men were gone, and the ship was now full\r\nof water and visibly breaking up, she abandoned herself to piteous\r\nlamentations.\r\n\r\nIt was already none before they descried any one on the shore or elsewhere\r\nto whom they could make appeal for help; but shortly after none it so\r\nchanced that a gentleman, Pericone da Visalgo by name, being on his return\r\nfrom one of his estates, passed that way with some mounted servants.\r\nCatching sight of the ship, he apprehended the circumstances at a glance,\r\nand bade one of his servants try to get aboard her, and let him know the\r\nresult. The servant with some difficulty succeeded in boarding the vessel,\r\nand found the gentle lady with her few companions ensconced under shelter of\r\nthe prow, and shrinking timidly from observation. At the first sight of him\r\nthey wept, and again and again implored him to have pity on them; but\r\nfinding that he did not understand them, nor they him, they sought by\r\ngestures to make him apprehend their forlorn condition.\r\n\r\nWith these tidings the servant, after making such survey of the ship as he\r\ncould, returned to Pericone, who forthwith caused the ladies, and all\r\narticles of value which were in the ship and could be removed, to be brought\r\noff her, and took them with him to one of his castles. The ladies' powers\r\nwere soon in a measure restored by food and rest, and by the honour which\r\nwas paid to Alatiel, and Alatiel alone by all the rest, as well as by the\r\nrichness of her dress, Pericone perceived that she must be some great lady.\r\nNor, though she was still pale, and her person bore evident marks of the\r\nsea's rough usage, did he fail to note that it was cast in a mould of\r\nextraordinary beauty. Wherefore his mind was soon made up that, if she\r\nlacked a husband, he would take her to wife and that, if he could not have\r\nher to wife, then he would make her his mistress. So this ardent lover, who\r\nwas a man of powerful frame and haughty mien, devoted himself for several\r\ndays to the service of the lady with excellent effect, for the lady\r\ncompletely recovered her strength and spirits, so that her beauty far\r\nexceeded Pericone's most sanguine conjectures. Great therefore beyond\r\nmeasure was his sorrow that he understood not her speech, nor she his, so\r\nthat neither could know who the other was; but being inordinately enamoured\r\nof her beauty, he sought by such mute blandishments as he could devise to\r\ndeclare his love, and bring her of her own accord to gratify his desire. All\r\nin vain, however; she repulsed his advances point blank; whereby his passion\r\nonly grew the stronger. So some days passed; and the lady perceiving\r\nPericone's constancy, and bethinking her that sooner or later she must yield\r\neither to force or to love, and gratify his passion, and judging by what she\r\nobserved of the customs of the people that she was amongst Christians, and\r\nin a part where, were she able to speak their language, she would gain\r\nlittle by making herself known, determined with a lofty courage to stand\r\nfirm and immovable in this extremity of her misfortunes. Wherefore she bade\r\nthe three women, who were all that were left to her, on no account to let\r\nany know who they were, unless they were so circumstanced that they might\r\nsafely count on assistance in effecting their escape: she also exhorted them\r\nmost earnestly to preserve their chastity, averring that she was firmly\r\nresolved that none but her husband should enjoy her. The women heartily\r\nassented, and promised that her injunctions should be obeyed to the utmost\r\nof their power.\r\n\r\nDay by day Pericone's passion waxed more ardent, being fomented by the\r\nproximity and contrariety of its object. Wherefore seeing that blandishment\r\navailed nothing, he was minded to have recourse to wiles and stratagems, and\r\nin the last resort to force. The lady, debarred by her law from the use of\r\nwine, found it, perhaps, on that account all the more palatable, which\r\nPericone observing determined to enlist Bacchus in the service of Venus. So,\r\nignoring her coyness, he provided one evening a supper, which was ordered\r\nwith all possible pomp and beauty, and graced by the presence of the lady.\r\nNo lack was there of incentives to hilarity; and Pericone directed the\r\nservant who waited on Alatiel to ply her with divers sorts of blended wines;\r\nwhich command the man faithfully executed. She, suspecting nothing, and\r\nseduced by the delicious flavour of the liquor, drank somewhat more freely\r\nthan was seemly, and forgetting her past woes, became frolicsome, and\r\nincited by some women who trod some measures in the Majorcan style, she\r\nshewed the company how they footed it in Alexandria. This novel demeanour\r\nwas by no means lost on Pericone, who saw in it a good omen of his speedy\r\nsuccess; so, with profuse relays of food and wine he prolonged the supper\r\nfar into the night.\r\n\r\nWhen the guests were at length gone, he attended the lady alone to her\r\nchamber, where, the heat of the wine overpowering the cold counsels of\r\nmodesty, she made no more account of Pericone's presence than if he had been\r\none of her women, and forthwith undressed and went to bed. Pericone was not\r\nslow to follow her, and as soon as the light was out lay down by her side,\r\nand taking her in his arms, without the least demur on her part, began, to\r\nsolace himself with her after the manner of lovers; which experience--she\r\nknew not till then with what horn men butt--caused her to repent that she\r\nhad not yielded to his blandishments; nor did she thereafter wait to be\r\ninvited to such nights of delight, but many a time declared her readiness,\r\nnot by words, for she had none to convey her meaning, but by gestures.\r\n\r\nBut this great felicity which she now shared with Pericone was not to last:\r\nfor not content with making her, instead of the consort of a king, the\r\nmistress of a castellan, Fortune had now in store for her a harsher\r\nexperience, though of an amorous character. Pericone had a brother,\r\ntwenty-five years of age, fair and fresh as a rose, his name Marato. On\r\nsight of Alatiel Marato had been mightily taken with her; he inferred from\r\nher bearing that he stood high in her good graces; he believed that nothing\r\nstood between him and the gratification of his passion but the jealous\r\nvigilance with which Pericone guarded her. So musing, he hit upon a ruthless\r\nexpedient, which had effect in action as hasty as heinous.\r\n\r\nIt so chanced that there then lay in the port of the city a ship, commanded\r\nby two Genoese, bound with a cargo of merchandise for Klarenza in the Morea:\r\nher sails were already hoist; and she tarried only for a favourable breeze.\r\nMarato approached the masters and arranged with them to take himself and the\r\nlady aboard on the following night. This done he concerted further action\r\nwith some of his most trusty friends, who readily lent him their aid to\r\ncarry his design into execution. So on the following evening towards\r\nnightfall, the conspirators stole unobserved into Pericone's house, which\r\nwas entirely unguarded, and there hid themselves, as pre-arranged. Then, as\r\nthe night wore on, Marato shewed them where Pericone and the lady slept, and\r\nthey entered the room, and slew Pericone. The lady thus rudely roused wept;\r\nbut silencing her by menaces of death they carried her off with the best\r\npart of Pericone's treasure, and hied them unobserved to the coast, where\r\nMarato parted from his companions, and forthwith took the lady aboard the\r\nship. The wind was now fair and fresh, the mariners spread the canvas, and\r\nthe vessel sped on her course.\r\n\r\nThis new misadventure, following so hard upon the former, caused the lady no\r\nsmall chagrin; but Marato, with the aid, of the good St. Crescent-in-hand\r\nthat God has given us, found means to afford her such consolation that she\r\nwas already grown so familiar with him as entirely to forget Pericone, when\r\nFortune, not content with her former caprices, added a new dispensation of\r\nwoe; for what with. the beauty of her person, which, as we have often said,\r\nwas extra ordinary, and the exquisite charm of her manners the two young\r\nmen, who commanded the ship, fell so desperately in love with her that they\r\nthought of nothing but how they might best serve and please her, so only\r\nthat Marato should not discover the reason of their assiduous attentions.\r\nAnd neither being ignorant of the other's love, they held secret counsel\r\ntogether, and resolved to make conquest of the lady on joint account: as if\r\nlove admitted of being held in partnership like merchandise or money. Which\r\ndesign being thwarted by the jealousy with which Alatiel was guarded by\r\nMarato, they chose a day and hour, when the ship was speeding amain under\r\ncanvas, and Marato was on the poop looking out over the sea and quite off\r\nhis guard; and going stealthily up behind him, they suddenly laid hands on\r\nhim, and threw him into the sea, and were already more than a mile on their\r\ncourse before any perceived that Marato was overboard. Which when the lady\r\nlearned, and knew that he was irretrievably lost, she relapsed into her\r\nformer plaintive mood. But the twain were forthwith by her side with soft\r\nspeeches and profuse promises, which, however ill she understood them, were\r\nnot altogether inapt to allay a grief which had in it more of concern for\r\nher own hapless self than of sorrow for her lost lover. So, in course of\r\ntime, the lady beginning visibly to recover heart, they began privily to\r\ndebate which of them should first take her to bed with him; and neither\r\nbeing willing to give way to the other, and no compromise being\r\ndiscoverable, high words passed between them, and the dispute grew so hot,\r\nthat they both waxed very wroth, drew their knives, and rushed madly at one\r\nanother, and before they could be parted by their men, several stabs had\r\nbeen given and received on either side, whereby the one fell dead on the\r\nspot, and the other was severely wounded in divers parts of the body. The\r\nlady was much disconcerted to find herself thus alone with none to afford\r\nher either succour or counsel, and was mightily afraid lest the wrath of the\r\nkinsfolk and friends of the twain should vent itself upon her. From this\r\nmortal peril she was, however, delivered by the intercessions of the wounded\r\nman and their speedy arrival at Klarenza.\r\n\r\nAs there she tarried at the same inn with her wounded lover, the fame of her\r\ngreat beauty was speedily bruited abroad, and reached the ears of the Prince\r\nof the Morea, who was then staying there. The Prince was curious to see her,\r\nand having so done, pronounced her even more beautiful than rumour had\r\nreported her; nay, he fell in love with her in such a degree that he could\r\nthink of nought else; and having heard in what guise she had come thither,\r\nhe deemed that he might have her. While he was casting about how to compass\r\nhis end, the kinsfolk of the wounded man, being apprised of the fact,\r\nforthwith sent her to him to the boundless delight, as well of the lady, who\r\nsaw therein her deliverance from a great peril, as of the Prince. The royal\r\nbearing, which enhanced the lady's charms, did not escape the Prince, who,\r\nbeing unable to discover her true rank, set her down as at any rate of noble\r\nlineage; wherefore he loved her as much again as before, and shewed her no\r\nsmall honour, treating her not as his mistress but as his wife. So the lady,\r\ncontrasting her present happy estate with her past woes, was comforted; and,\r\nas her gaiety revived, her beauty waxed in such a degree that all the Morea\r\ntalked of it and of little else: insomuch that the Prince's friend and\r\nkinsman, the young, handsome and gallant Duke of Athens, was smitten with a\r\ndesire to see her, and taking occasion to pay the Prince a visit, as he was\r\nnow and again wont to do, came to Klarenza with a goodly company of\r\nhonourable gentlemen. The Prince received him with all distinction and made\r\nhim heartily welcome, but did not at first shew him the lady. By and by,\r\nhowever, their conversation began to turn upon her and her charms, and the\r\nDuke asked if she were really so marvellous a creature as folk said. The\r\nPrince replied:--\"Nay, but even more so; and thereof thou shalt have better\r\nassurance than my words, to wit, the witness of thine own eyes.\" So, without\r\ndelay, for the Duke was now all impatience, they waited on the lady, who was\r\nprepared for their visit, and received them very courteously and graciously.\r\nThey seated her between them, and being debarred from the pleasure of\r\nconversing with her, for of their speech she understood little or nothing,\r\nthey both, and especially the Duke, who was scarce able to believe that she\r\nwas of mortal mould, gazed upon her in mute admiration; whereby the Duke,\r\ncheating himself with the idea that he was but gratifying his curiosity,\r\ndrank with his eyes, unawares, deep draughts of the poisoned chalice of\r\nlove, and, to his own lamentable hurt, fell a prey to a most ardent passion.\r\nHis first thought, when they had left her, and he had time for reflection,\r\nwas that the Prince was the luckiest man in the world to have a creature so\r\nfair to solace him; and swayed by his passion, his mind soon inclined to\r\ndivers other and less honourable meditations, whereof the issue was that,\r\ncome what might, he would despoil the Prince of his felicity, and, if\r\npossible, make it his own. This resolution was no sooner taken than, being\r\nof a hasty temperament, he cast to the winds all considerations of honour\r\nand justice, and studied only how to compass his end by craft. So, one day,\r\nas the first step towards the accomplishment of his evil purpose, he\r\narranged with the Prince's most trusted chamberlain, one Ciuriaci, that his\r\nhorses and all other his personal effects should, with the utmost secrecy,\r\nbe got ready against a possible sudden departure: and then at nightfall,\r\nattended by a single comrade (both carrying arms), he was privily admitted\r\nby Ciuriaci into the Prince's chamber. It was a hot night, and the Prince\r\nhad risen without disturbing the lady, and was standing bare to the skin at\r\nan open window fronting the sea, to enjoy a light breeze that blew thence.\r\nSo, by preconcert with his comrade, the Duke stole up to the window, and in\r\na trice ran the Prince through the body, and caught him up, and threw him\r\nout of the window. The palace was close by the sea, but at a considerable\r\naltitude above it, and the window, through which the Prince's body was\r\nthrown, looked over some houses, which, being sapped by the sea, had become\r\nruinous, and were rarely or never visited by a soul; whereby, as the Duke\r\nhad foreseen, the fall of the Prince's body passed, as indeed it could not\r\nbut pass, unobserved. Thereupon the Duke's accomplice whipped out a halter,\r\nwhich he had brought with him for the purpose, and, making as if he were but\r\nin play, threw it round Ciuriaci's neck, drew it so tight that he could not\r\nutter a sound, and then, with the Duke's aid, strangled him, and sent him\r\nafter his master. All this was accomplished, as the Duke knew full well,\r\nwithout awakening any in the palace, not even the lady, whom he now\r\napproached with a light, and holding it over the bed gently uncovered her\r\nperson, as she lay fast asleep, and surveyed her from head to foot to his no\r\nsmall satisfaction; for fair as she had seemed to him dressed, he found her\r\nunadorned charms incomparably greater. As he gazed, his passion waxed beyond\r\nmeasure, and, reckless of his recent crime, and of the blood which still\r\nstained his hands, he got forthwith into the bed; and she, being too sound\r\nasleep to distinguish between him and the Prince, suffered him to lie with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nBut, boundless as was his delight, it brooked no long continuance, so,\r\nrising, he called to him some of his comrades, by whom he had the lady\r\nsecured in such manner that she could utter no sound, and borne out of the\r\npalace by the same secret door by which he had gained entrance; he then set\r\nher on horseback and in dead silence put his troop in motion, taking the\r\nroad to Athens. He did not, however, venture to take the lady to Athens,\r\nwhere she would have encountered his Duchess--for he was married--but lodged\r\nher in a very beautiful villa which he had hard by the city overlooking the\r\nsea, where, most forlorn of ladies, she lived secluded, but with no lack of\r\nmeet and respectful service.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the Prince's courtiers awaited his rising until\r\nnone, but perceiving no sign of it, opened the doors, which had not been\r\nsecured, and entered his bedroom. Finding it vacant, they supposed that the\r\nPrince was gone off privily somewhere to have a few days of unbroken delight\r\nwith his fair lady; and so they gave themselves no further trouble. But the\r\nnext day it so chanced that an idiot, roaming about the ruins where lay the\r\ncorpses of the Prince and Ciuriaci, drew the latter out by the halter and\r\nwent off dragging it after him. The corpse was soon recognised by not a few,\r\nwho, at first struck dumb with amazement, soon recovered sense enough to\r\ncajole the idiot into retracing his steps and shewing them the spot where he\r\nhad found it; and having thus, to the immeasurable grief of all the\r\ncitizens, discovered the Prince's body, they buried it with all honour.\r\nNeedless to say that no pains were spared to trace the perpetrators of so\r\nheinous a crime, and that the absence and evidently furtive departure of the\r\nDuke of Athens caused him to be suspected both of the murder and of the\r\nabduction of the lady. So the citizens were instant with one accord that the\r\nPrince's brother, whom they chose as his successor, should exact the debt of\r\nvengeance; and he, having satisfied himself by further investigation that\r\ntheir suspicion was well founded, summoned to his aid his kinsfolk, friends\r\nand divers vassals, and speedily gathered a large, powerful and\r\nwell-equipped army, with intent to make war upon the Duke of Athens. The\r\nDuke, being informed of his movements, made ready likewise to defend himself\r\nwith all his power; nor had he any lack of allies, among whom the Emperor of\r\nConstantinople sent his son, Constantine, and his nephew, Manuel, with a\r\ngreat and goodly force. The two young men were honourably received by the\r\nDuke, and still more so by the Duchess, who was Constantine's sister.\r\n\r\nDay by day war grew more imminent, and at last the Duchess took occasion to\r\ncall Constantine and Manuel into her private chamber, and with many tears\r\ntold them the whole story at large, explaining the casus belli, dilating on\r\nthe indignity which she suffered at the hands of the Duke if as was\r\nbelieved, he really kept a mistress in secret, and beseeching them in most\r\npiteous accents to do the best they could to devise some expedient whereby\r\nthe Duke's honour might be cleared, and her own peace of mind assured. The\r\nyoung men knew exactly how matters stood; and so, without wearying the\r\nDuchess with many questions, they did their best to console her, and\r\nsucceeded in raising her hopes. Before taking their leave they learned from\r\nher where the lady was, whose marvellous beauty they had heard lauded so\r\noften; and being eager to see her, they besought the Duke to afford them an\r\nopportunity. Forgetful of what a like complaisance had cost the Prince, he\r\nconsented, and next morning brought them to the villa where the lady lived,\r\nand with her and a few of his boon companions regaled them with a lordly\r\nbreakfast, which was served in a most lovely garden. Constantine had no\r\nsooner seated himself and surveyed the lady, than he was lost in admiration,\r\ninly affirming that he had never seen so beautiful a creature, and that for\r\nsuch a prize the Duke, or any other man, might well be pardoned treachery or\r\nany other crime: he scanned her again and again, and ever with more and more\r\nadmiration; where-by it fared with him even as it had fared with the Duke.\r\nHe went away hotly in love with her, and dismissing all thought of the war,\r\ncast about for some method by which, without betraying his passion to any,\r\nhe might devise some means of wresting the lady from the Duke.\r\n\r\nAs he thus burned and brooded, the Prince drew dangerously near the Duke's\r\ndominions; wherefore order was given for an advance, and the Duke, with\r\nConstantine and the rest, marshalled his forces and led them forth from\r\nAthens to bar the Prince's passage of the frontier at certain points. Some\r\ndays thus passed, during which Constantine, whose mind and soul were\r\nentirely absorbed by his passion for the lady, bethought him, that, as the\r\nDuke was no longer in her neighbourhood, he might readily compass his end.\r\nHe therefore feigned to be seriously unwell, and, having by this pretext\r\nobtained the Duke's leave, he ceded his command to Manuel, and returned to\r\nhis sister at Athens. He had not been there many days before the Duchess\r\nrecurred to the dishonour which the Duke did her by keeping the lady;\r\nwhereupon he said that of that, if she approved, he would certainly relieve\r\nher by seeing that the lady was removed from the villa to some distant\r\nplace. The Duchess, supposing that Constantine was prompted not by jealousy\r\nof the Duke but by jealousy for her honour, gave her hearty consent to his\r\nplan, provided he so contrived that the Duke should never know that she had\r\nbeen privy to it; on which point Constantine gave her ample assurance. So,\r\nbeing authorised by the Duchess to act as he might deem best, he secretly\r\nequipped a light bark and manned her with some of his men, to whom he\r\nconfided his plan, bidding them lie to off the garden of the lady's villa;\r\nand so, having sent the bark forward, he hied him with other of his men to\r\nthe villa. He gained ready admission of the servants, and was made heartily\r\nwelcome by the lady, who, at his desire, attended by some of her servants,\r\nwalked with him and some of his comrades in the garden. By and by, feigning\r\nthat he had a message for her from the Duke, he drew her aside towards a\r\ngate that led down to the sea, and which one of his confederates had already\r\nopened. A concerted signal brought the bark alongside, and to seize the lady\r\nand set her aboard the bark was but the work of an instant. Her retinue hung\r\nback as they heard Constantine menace with death whoso but stirred or spoke,\r\nand suffered him, protesting that what he did was done not to wrong the\r\nDuke, but solely to vindicate his sister's honour, to embark with his men.\r\nThe lady wept, of course, but Constantine was at her side, the rowers gave\r\nway, and the bark, speeding like a thing of life over the waves, made Egina\r\nshortly after dawn. There Constantine and the lady landed, she still\r\nlamenting her fatal beauty, and took a little rest and pleasure. Then,\r\nre-embarking, they continued their voyage, and in the course of a few days\r\nreached Chios, which Constantine, fearing paternal censure, and that he\r\nmight be deprived of his fair booty, deemed a safe place of sojourn. So,\r\nafter some days of repose the lady ceased to bewail her harsh destiny, and\r\nsuffering Constantine to console her as his predecessors had done, began\r\nonce more to enjoy the good gifts which Fortune sent her.\r\n\r\nNow while they thus dallied, Osbech, King of the Turks, who was perennially\r\nat war with the Emperor, came by chance to Smyrna; and there learning, that\r\nConstantine was wantoning in careless ease at Chios with a lady of whom he\r\nhad made prize, he made a descent by night upon the island with an armed\r\nflotilla. Landing his men in dead silence, he made captives of not a few of\r\nthe Chians whom he surprised in their beds; others, who took the alarm and\r\nrushed to arms, he slew; and having wasted the whole island with fire, he\r\nshipped the booty and the prisoners, and sailed back to Smyrna. As there he\r\noverhauled the booty, he lit upon the fair lady, and knew her for the same\r\nthat had been taken in bed and fast asleep with Constantine: whereat, being\r\na young man, he was delighted beyond measure, and made her his wife out of\r\nhand with all due form and ceremony. And so for several months he enjoyed\r\nher.\r\n\r\nNow there had been for some time and still was a treaty pending between the\r\nEmperor and Basano, King of Cappadocia, whereby Basano with his forces was\r\nto fall on Osbech on one side while the Emperor attacked him on the other.\r\nSome demands made by Basano, which the Emperor deemed unreasonable, had so\r\nfar retarded the conclusion of the treaty; but no sooner had the Emperor\r\nlearned the fate of his son than, distraught with grief, he forthwith\r\nconceded the King of Cappadocia's demands, and was instant with him to fall\r\nat once upon Osbech while he made ready to attack him on the other side.\r\nGetting wind of the Emperor's design, Osbech collected his forces, and, lest\r\nhe should be caught and crushed between the convergent armies of two most\r\nmighty potentates, advanced against the King of Cappadocia. The fair lady he\r\nleft at Smyrna in the care of a faithful dependant and friend, and after a\r\nwhile joined battle with the King of Cappadocia, in which battle he was\r\nslain, and his army defeated and dispersed. Wherefore Basano with his\r\nvictorious host advanced, carrying everything before him, upon Smyrna, and\r\nreceiving everywhere the submission due to a conqueror.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Osbech's dependant, by name Antioco, who had charge of the fair\r\nlady, was so smitten with her charms that, albeit he was somewhat advanced\r\nin years, he broke faith with his friend and lord, and allowed himself to\r\nbecome enamoured of her. He had the advantage of knowing her language, which\r\ncounted for much with one who for some years had been, as it were, compelled\r\nto live the life of a deaf mute, finding none whom she could understand or\r\nby whom she might be understood; and goaded by passion, he in the course of\r\na few days established such a degree of intimacy with her that in no long\r\ntime it passed from friendship into love, so that their lord, far away amid\r\nthe clash of arms and the tumult of the battle, was forgotten, and\r\nmarvellous pleasure had they of one another between the sheets.\r\n\r\nHowever, news came at last of Osbech's defeat and death, and the victorious\r\nand unchecked advance of Basano, whose advent they were by no means minded\r\nto await. Wherefore, taking with them the best part of the treasure that\r\nOsbech had left there, they hied them with all possible secrecy to Rhodes.\r\nThere they had not along abode before Antioco fell ill of a mortal disease.\r\nHe had then with him a Cypriote merchant, an intimate and very dear friend,\r\nto whom, as he felt his end approach, he resolved to leave all that he\r\npossessed, including his dear lady. So, when he felt death imminent, he\r\ncalled them to him and said:--\"'Tis now quite evident to me that my life is\r\nfast ebbing away; and sorely do I regret it, for never had I so much\r\npleasure of life as now. Well content indeed I am in one respect, in that,\r\nas die I must, I at least die in the arms of the two persons whom I love\r\nmore than any other in the world, to wit, in thine arms, dearest friend, and\r\nthose of this lady, whom, since I have known her, I have loved more than\r\nmyself. But yet 'tis grievous to me to know that I must leave her here in a\r\nstrange land with none to afford her either protection or counsel; and but\r\nthat I leave her with thee, who, I doubt not, wilt have for my sake no less\r\ncare of her than thou wouldst have had of me, 'twould grieve me still more;\r\nwherefore with all my heart and soul I pray thee, that, if I die, thou take\r\nher with all else that belongs to me into thy charge, and so acquit thyself\r\nof thy trust as thou mayst deem conducive to the peace of my soul. And of\r\nthee, dearest lady, I entreat one favour, that I be not forgotten of, thee,\r\nafter my death, so that there whither I go it may still be my boast to be\r\nbeloved here of the most beautiful lady that nature ever formed. Let me but\r\ndie with these two hopes assured, and without doubt I shall depart in\r\npeace.\"\r\n\r\nBoth the merchant and the lady wept to hear him thus speak, and, when he had\r\ndone, comforted him, and promised faithfully, in the event of his death, to\r\ndo even as he besought them. He died almost immediately afterwards, and was\r\nhonourably buried by them. A few days sufficed the merchant to wind up all\r\nhis affairs in Rhodes and being minded to return to Cyprus aboard a Catalan\r\nboat that was there, he asked the fair lady what she purposed to do if he\r\nwent back to Cyprus. The lady answered, that, if it were agreeable to him,\r\nshe would gladly accompany him, hoping that for love of Antioco, he would\r\ntreat and regard her as his sister. The merchant replied, that it would\r\nafford him all the pleasure in the world; and, to protect her from insult\r\nuntil their arrival in Cyprus, he gave her out as his wife, and, suiting\r\naction to word, slept with her on the boat in an alcove in a little cabin in\r\nthe poop. Whereby that happened which on neither side was intended when they\r\nleft Rhodes, to wit, that the darkness and the comfort and the warmth of the\r\nbed, forces of no mean efficacy, did so prevail with them that dead Antioco\r\nwas forgotten alike as lover and as friend, and by a common impulse they\r\nbegan to wanton together, insomuch that before they were arrived at Baffa,\r\nwhere the Cypriote resided, they were indeed man and wife. At Baffa the lady\r\ntarried with the merchant a good while, during which it so befell that a\r\ngentleman, Antigono by name, a man of ripe age and riper wisdom but no great\r\nwealth, being one that had had vast and various experience of affairs in the\r\nservice of the King of Cyprus but had found fortune adverse to him, came to\r\nBaffa on business; and passing one day by the house where the fair lady was\r\nthen living by herself, for the Cypriote merchant was gone to Armenia with\r\nsome of his wares, he chanced to catch sight of the lady at one of the\r\nwindows, and, being struck by her extraordinary beauty, regarded her\r\nattentively, and began to have some vague recollection of having seen her\r\nbefore, but could by no means remember where. The fair lady, however, so\r\nlong the sport of Fortune, but now nearing the term of her woes, no sooner\r\nsaw Antigono than she remembered to have seen him in her father's service,\r\nand in no mean capacity, at Alexandria. Wherefore she forthwith sent for\r\nhim, hoping that by his counsel she might elude her merchant and be\r\nreinstated in her true character and dignity of princess. When he presented\r\nhimself, she asked him with some embarrassment whether he were, as she took\r\nhim to be, Antigono of Famagosta. He answered in the affirmative,\r\nadding:--\"And of you, madam, I have a sort of recollection, though I cannot\r\nsay where I have seen you; wherefore so it irk you not, bring, I pray you,\r\nyourself to my remembrance.\" Satisfied that it was Antigono himself, the\r\nlady in a flood of tears threw herself upon him to his no small amazement,\r\nand embraced his neck: then, after a little while, she asked him whether he\r\nhad never see her in Alexandria. The question awakened Antigono's memory; he\r\nat once recognised Alatiel, the Soldan's daughter, whom he had though to\r\nhave been drowned at sea, and would have paid her due homage; but she would\r\nnot suffer it, and bade him be seated with her for a while. Being seated, he\r\nrespectfully asked her, how, and when and whence she had come thither,\r\nseeing that all Egypt believed for certain that she had been drowned at sea\r\nsome years before. \"And would that so it had been,\" said the lady, \"rather\r\nthan I should have led the life that I have led; and so doubtless will my\r\nfather say, if he shall ever come to know of it.\" And so saying, she burst\r\ninto such a flood of tears that 'twas a wonder to see. Wherefore Antigono\r\nsaid to her:--\"Nay but, madam, be not distressed before the occasion arises.\r\nI pray you, tell me the story of your adventures, and what has been the\r\ntenor of your life; perchance 'twill prove to be no such matter but, God\r\nhelping us, we may set it all straight.\" \"Antigono,\" said the fair lady,\r\n\"when I saw thee, 'twas as if I saw my father, and 'twas the tender love by\r\nwhich I am holden to him that prompted me to make myself known to thee,\r\nthough I might have kept my secret; and few indeed there are, whom to have\r\nmet would have afforded me such pleasure as this which I have in meeting and\r\nrecognising thee before all others; wherefore I will now make known to thee\r\nas to my father that which in my evil fortune I have ever kept close. If,\r\nwhen thou hast heard my story, thou seest any means whereby I may be\r\nreinstated in my former honour, I pray thee use it. If not, disclose to none\r\nthat thou hast seen me or heard aught of me.\"\r\n\r\nThen, weeping between every word, she told him her whole story from the day\r\nof the shipwreck at Majorca to that hour. Antigono wept in sympathy, and\r\nthen said:--\"Madam, as throughout this train of misfortunes you have happily\r\nescaped recognition, I undertake to restore you to your father in such sort\r\nthat you shall be dearer to him than ever before, and be afterwards married\r\nto the King of Algarve. \"How?\" she asked. Whereupon he explained to her in\r\ndetail how he meant to proceed; and, lest delay should give occasion to\r\nanother to interfere, he went back at once to Famagosta, and having obtained\r\naudience of the King, thus he spoke:--\"Sire, so please you, you have it in\r\nyour power at little cost to yourself to do a thing, which will at once\r\nredound most signally to your honour and confer a great boon on me, who have\r\ngrown poor in your service.\" \"How?\" asked the King. Then said Antigono:--\"At\r\nBaffa is of late arrived a fair damsel, daughter of the Soldan, long thought\r\nto be drowned, who to preserve her chastity has suffered long and severe\r\nhardship. She is now reduced to poverty, and is desirous of returning to her\r\nfather. If you should be pleased to send her back to him under my escort,\r\nyour honour and my interest would be served in high and equal measure; nor\r\ndo I think that such a service would ever be forgotten by the Soldan.\"\r\n\r\nWith true royal generosity the King forthwith signified his approval, and\r\nhad Alatiel brought under honourable escort to Famagosta, where, attended by\r\nhis Queen, he received her with every circumstance of festal pomp and\r\ncourtly magnificence. Schooled by Antigono, she gave the King and Queen such\r\na version of her adventures as satisfied their inquiries in every\r\nparticular. So, after a few days, the King sent her back to the Soldan under\r\nescort of Antigono, attended by a goodly company of honourable men and\r\nwomen; and of the cheer which the Soldan made her, and not her only but\r\nAntigono and all his company, it boots not to ask. When she was somewhat\r\nrested, the Soldan inquired how it was that she was yet alive, and where she\r\nhad been go long without letting him know how it fared with her. Whereupon\r\nthe lady, who had got Antigono's lesson by heart, answered thus:--\"My\r\nfather, 'twas perhaps the twentieth night after my departure from you when\r\nour ship parted her timbers in a terrible storm and went ashore nigh a place\r\ncalled Aguamorta, away there in the West: what was the fate of the men that\r\nwere aboard our ship I know not, nor knew I ever; I remember only, that,\r\nwhen day came, and I returned, as it were, from death to life, the wreck,\r\nhaving been sighted, was boarded by folk from all the country-side, intent\r\non plunder; and I and two of my women were taken ashore, where the women\r\nwere forthwith parted from me by the young men, nor did I ever learn their\r\nfate. Now hear my own. Struggling might and main, I was seized by two young\r\nmen, who dragged me, weeping bitterly, by the hair of the head, towards a\r\ngreat forest; but, on sight of four men who were then passing that way on\r\nhorseback, they forthwith loosed me and took to flight. Whereupon the four\r\nmen, who struck me as persons of great authority, ran up to me; and much\r\nthey questioned me, and much I said to them; but neither did they understand\r\nme, nor I them. So, after long time conferring together, they set me on one\r\nof their horses and brought me to a house, where dwelt a community of\r\nladies, religious according to their law; and what the men may have said I\r\nknow not, but there I was kindly received and ever honourably entreated by\r\nall; and with them I did afterwards most reverentially pay my devotions to\r\nSt. Crescent-in-Hollow, who is held in great honour by the women of that\r\ncountry. When I had been some time with them, and had learned something of\r\ntheir language, they asked me who and whence I was: whereto I, knowing that\r\nI was in a convent, and fearing to be cast out as a foe to their law if I\r\ntold the truth, answered that I was the daughter of a great gentleman of\r\nCyprus, who had intended to marry me to a gentleman of Crete; but that on\r\nthe voyage we had been driven out of our course and wrecked at Aguamorta.\r\nAnd so I continued, as occasion required, observing their usages with much\r\nassiduity, lest worse should befall me; but being one day asked by their\r\nsuperior, whom they call abbess, whether I was minded to go back to Cyprus,\r\nI answered that, there was nought that I desired so much. However, so\r\nsolicitous for my honour was the abbess, that there was none going to Cyprus\r\nto whom she would entrust me, until, two months or so ago, there arrived\r\nsome worthy men from France, of whom one was a kinsman of the abbess, with\r\ntheir wives. They were on their way to visit the sepulchre where He whom\r\nthey hold to be God was buried after He had suffered death at the hands of\r\nthe Jews; and the abbess, learning their destination, prayed them to take\r\ncharge of me, and restore me to my father in Cyprus. With what cheer, with\r\nwhat honour, these gentlemen and their wives entertained me, 'twere long to\r\ntell. But, in brief, we embarked, and in the course of a few days arrived at\r\nBaffa, where it was so ordered by the providence of God, who perchance took\r\npity on me, that in the very hour of our disembarkation I, not knowing a\r\nsoul and being at a loss how to answer the gentlemen, who would fain have\r\ndischarged the trust laid upon them by the reverend abbess and restored me\r\nto my father, fell in, on the shore, with Antigono, whom I forthwith called,\r\nand in our language, that I might be understood neither of the gentlemen nor\r\nof their wives, bade him acknowledge me as his daughter. He understood my\r\ncase at once, made much of me, and to the utmost of his slender power\r\nhonourably requited the gentlemen. He then brought me to the King of Cyprus,\r\nwho accorded me welcome there and conduct hither so honourable as words of\r\nmine can never describe. If aught remains to tell, you had best learn it\r\nfrom the lips of Antigono, who has often heard my story.\"\r\n\r\nThen Antigono, addressing the Soldan, said:--\"Sire, what she has told you\r\naccords with what she has often told me, and, with what I have learned from\r\nthe gentlemen and ladies who accompanied her. One thing, however, she has\r\nomitted, because, I suppose, it hardly becomes her to tell it; to wit, all\r\nthat the gentlemen and ladies, who accompanied her, said of the virtuous and\r\ngracious and noble life which she led with the devout ladies, and of the\r\ntears and wailings of both the ladies and the gentlemen, when they parted\r\nwith her to me. But were I to essay to repeat all that they said to me, the\r\nday that now is, and the night that is to follow, were all too short:\r\nsuffice it to say so much as this, that, by what I gathered from their words\r\nand have been able to see for myself, you may make it your boast, that among\r\nall the daughters of all your peers that wear the crown none can be matched\r\nwith yours for virtue and true worth.\"\r\n\r\nBy all which the Soldan was so overjoyed that 'twas a wonder to see. Again\r\nand again he made supplication to God, that of His grace power might be\r\nvouchsafed him adequately to recompense all who had done honour to his\r\ndaughter, and most especially the King of Cyprus, for the honourable escort\r\nunder which he had sent her thither; for Antigono he provided a magnificent\r\nguerdon, and some days later gave him his conge to return to Cyprus, at the\r\nsame time by a special ambassage conveying to the King his grateful\r\nacknowledgments of the manner in which he had treated his daughter. Then,\r\nbeing minded that his first intent, to wit, that his daughter should be the\r\nbride of the King of Algarve, should not be frustrate, he wrote to the King,\r\ntelling him all, and adding that, if he were still minded to have her, he\r\nmight send for her. The King was overjoyed by these tidings, and having sent\r\nfor her with great pomp, gave her on her arrival a hearty welcome. So she,\r\nwho had lain with eight men, in all, perhaps, ten thousand times, was bedded\r\nwith him as a virgin, and made him believe that a virgin she was, and lived\r\nlong and happily with him as his queen: wherefore 'twas said:--\"Mouth, for\r\nkisses, was never the worse: like as the moon reneweth her course.\"\r\n\r\n(1) I.e. according to medieval usage, Egypt.\r\n(2) I.e. Garbo, the coast of Africa opposite Andalusia and Granada.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VIII.\r\n\r\n--\r\nThe Count of Antwerp, labouring under a false accusation goes into exile. He\r\nleaves his two children in different places in England, and takes service in\r\nIreland. Returning to England an unknown man, he finds his sons prosperous.\r\nHe serves as a groom in the army of the King of France; his innocence is\r\nestablished and he is restored to his former honours.\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe ladies heaved many sighs over the various fortunes of the fair lady: but\r\nwhat prompted those sighs who shall say? With some, perchance, 'twas as much\r\nenvy as pity of one to whose lot fell so many nights of delight. But,\r\nhowever this may be, when Pamfilo's story was ended, and the laughter which\r\ngreeted his last words had subsided, the queen turned to Elisa, and bade her\r\nfollow suit with one of her stories. So Elisa with a cheerful courage thus\r\nbegan:--\r\n\r\nVast indeed is the field that lies before us, wherein to roam at large;\r\n'twould readily afford each of us not one course but ten, so richly has\r\nFortune diversified it with episodes both strange and sombre; wherefore\r\nselecting one such from this infinite store, I say:--That, after the\r\ntransference of the Roman Empire from the Franks to the Germans, the\r\ngreatest enmity prevailed between the two nations, with warfare perpetual\r\nand relentless: wherefore, deeming that the offensive would be their best\r\ndefence, the King of France and his son mustered all the forces they could\r\nraise from their own dominions and those of their kinsmen and allies, and\r\narrayed a grand army for the subjugation of their enemies. Before they took\r\nthe field, as they could not leave the realm without a governor, they chose\r\nfor that office Gautier, Count of Antwerp, a true knight and sage\r\ncounsellor, and their very loyal ally and vassal, choosing him the rather,\r\nbecause, albeit he was a thorough master of the art of war, yet they deemed\r\nhim less apt to support its hardships than for the conduct of affairs of a\r\ndelicate nature. Him, therefore, they set in their place as their\r\nvicar-general and regent of the whole realm of France, and having so done,\r\nthey took the field.\r\n\r\nCount Gautier ordered his administration wisely and in a regular course,\r\ndiscussing all matters with the queen and her daughter-in-law; whom, albeit\r\nthey were left under his charge and jurisdiction, he nevertheless treated as\r\nhis ladies paramount. The Count was about forty years of age, and the very\r\nmould of manly beauty; in bearing as courteous and chivalrous as ever a\r\ngentleman might be, and withal so debonair and dainty, so feat and trim of\r\nperson that he had not his peer, among the gallants of that day. His wife\r\nwas dead, leaving him two children and no more, to wit, a boy and a girl,\r\nstill quite young. Now the King and his son being thus away at the war, and\r\nthe Count frequenting the court of the two said ladies, and consulting with\r\nthem upon affairs of state, it so befell, that the Prince's lady regarded\r\nhim with no small favour, being very sensible alike of the advantages of his\r\nperson and the nobility of his bearing; whereby she conceived for him a\r\npassion which was all the more ardent because it was secret. And, as he was\r\nwithout a wife, and she was still in the freshness of her youth, she saw not\r\nwhy she should not readily be gratified; but supposing that nothing stood in\r\nthe way but her own shamefastness, she resolved to be rid of that, and\r\ndisclose her mind to him without any reserve. So one day, when she was\r\nalone, she seized her opportunity, and sent for him, as if she were desirous\r\nto converse with him on indifferent topics. The Count, his mind entirely\r\naloof from the lady's purpose, presented himself forthwith, and at her\r\ninvitation sate down by her side on a settee. They were quite alone in the\r\nroom; but the Count had twice asked her the reason why she had so honoured\r\nhim, before, overcome by passion, she broke silence, and crimson from neck\r\nwith shame, half sobbing, trembling in every limb, and at every word, she\r\nthus spoke:--\"Dearest friend and sweet my lord, sagacity such as yours\r\ncannot but be apt to perceive how great is the frailty of men and women, and\r\nhow, for divers reasons, it varies in different persons in such a degree\r\nthat no just judge would mete out the same measure to each indifferently,\r\nthough the fault were apparently the same. Who would not acknowledge that a\r\npoor man or woman, fain to earn daily bread by the sweat of the brow, is far\r\nmore reprehensible in yielding to the solicitations of love, than a rich\r\nlady, whose life is lapped in ease and unrestricted luxury? Not a soul, I am\r\npersuaded, but would so acknowledge! Wherefore I deem that the possession of\r\nthese boons of fortune should go far indeed to acquit the possessor, if she,\r\nperchance, indulge an errant love; and, for the rest, that, if she have\r\nchosen a wise and worthy lover, she should be entirely exonerated. And as I\r\nthink I may fairly claim the benefit of both these pleas, and of others\r\nbeside, to wit, my youth and my husband's absence, which naturally incline\r\nme to love, 'tis meet that I now urge them in your presence in defence of my\r\npassion; and if they have the weight with you which they should have with\r\nthe wise, I pray you to afford me your help and counsel in the matter\r\nwherein I shall demand it. I avow that in the absence of my husband I have\r\nbeen unable to withstand the promptings of the flesh and the power of love,\r\nforces of such potency that even the strongest men--not to speak of delicate\r\nwomen--have not seldom been, nay daily are, overcome by them; and so, living\r\nthus, as you see me, in ease and luxury, I have allowed the allurements of\r\nlove to draw me on until at last I find myself a prey to passion. Wherein\r\nwere I discovered, I were, I confess, dishonoured; but discovery being\r\navoided, I count the dishonour all but nought. Moreover, love has been so\r\ngracious to me that not only has he spared to blind me in the choice of my\r\nlover, but he has even lent me his most effective aid, pointing me to one\r\nwell worthy of the love of a lady such as I, even to yourself; whom, if I\r\nmisread not my mind, I deem the most handsome and courteous and debonair,\r\nand therewithal the sagest cavalier that the realm of France may shew. And\r\nas you are without a wife, so may I say that I find myself without a\r\nhusband. Wherefore in return for this great love I bear you, deny me not, I\r\npray you, yours; but have pity on my youth, which wastes away for you like\r\nice before the fire.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were followed by such a flood of tears, that, albeit she had\r\nintended yet further to press her suit, speech failed her; her eyes drooped,\r\nand, almost swooning with emotion, she let her head fall upon the Count's\r\nbreast. The Count, who was the most loyal of knights, began with all\r\nseverity to chide her mad passion and to thrust her from him--for she was\r\nnow making as if she would throw her arms around his neck--and to asseverate\r\nwith oaths that he would rather be hewn in pieces than either commit, or\r\nabet another in committing such an offence against the honour of his lord;\r\nwhen the lady, catching his drift, and forgetting all her love in a sudden\r\nfrenzy of rage, cried out:--\"So! unknightly knight, is it thus you flout my\r\nlove? Now Heaven forbid, but, as you would be the death of me, I either do\r\nyou to death or drive you from the world!\" So saying, she dishevelled and\r\ntore her hair and rent her garments to shreds about her bosom. Which done,\r\nshe began shrieking at the top of her voice:--\"Help! help! The Count of\r\nAntwerp threatens to violate me!\" Whereupon the Count, who knew that a clear\r\nconscience was no protection against the envy of courtiers, and doubted that\r\nhis innocence would prove scarce a match for the cunning of the lady,\r\nstarted to his feet, and hied him with all speed out of the room, out of the\r\npalace, and back to his own house. Counsel of none he sought; but forthwith\r\nset his children on horseback, and taking horse himself, departed post haste\r\nfor Calais. The lady's cries brought not a few to her aid, who, observing\r\nher plight, not only gave entire credence to her story, but improved upon\r\nit, alleging that the debonair and accomplished Count had long employed all\r\nthe arts of seduction to compass his end. So they rushed in hot haste to the\r\nCount's house, with intent to arrest him, and not finding him, sacked it and\r\nrazed it to the ground. The news, as glosed and garbled, being carried to\r\nthe King and Prince in the field, they were mightily incensed, and offered a\r\ngreat reward for the Count, dead or alive, and condemned him and his\r\nposterity to perpetual banishment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Count, sorely troubled that by his flight his innocence shewed\r\nas guilt, pursued his journey, and concealing his identity, and being\r\nrecognised by none, arrived with his two children at Calais. Thence he\r\nforthwith crossed to England, and, meanly clad, fared on for London, taking\r\ncare as he went to school his children in all that belonged to their new way\r\nof life, and especially in two main articles: to wit, that they should bear\r\nwith resignation the poverty to which, by no fault of theirs, but solely by\r\none of Fortune's caprices, they and he were reduced, and that they should be\r\nmost sedulously on their guard to betray to none, as they valued their\r\nlives, whence they were, or who their father was. The son, Louis by name,\r\nwas perhaps nine, and the daughter, Violante, perhaps seven years of age.\r\nFor years so tender they proved apt pupils, and afterwards shewed by their\r\nconduct that they had well learned their father's lesson. He deemed it\r\nexpedient to change their names, and accordingly called the boy Perrot and\r\nthe girl Jeannette. So, meanly clad, the Count and his two children arrived\r\nat London, and there made shift to get a living by going about soliciting\r\nalms in the guise of French mendicants.\r\n\r\nNow, as for this purpose they waited one morning outside a church, it so\r\nbefell that a great lady, the wife of one of the marshals of the King of\r\nEngland, observed them, as she left the church, asking alms, and demanded of\r\nthe Count whence he was, and whether the children were his. He answered that\r\nhe was from Picardy, that the children were his, and that he had been fain\r\nto leave Picardy by reason of the misconduct of their reprobate elder\r\nbrother. The lady looked at the girl, who being fair, and of gentle and\r\nwinning mien and manners, found much favour in her eyes. So the kind-hearted\r\nlady said to the Count:--\"My good man, if thou art willing to leave thy\r\nlittle daughter with me, I like her looks so well that I will gladly take\r\nher; and if she grow up a good woman, I will see that she is suitably\r\nmarried when the right time comes.\" The Count was much gratified by the\r\nproposal, which he forthwith accepted, and parted with the girl, charging\r\nthe lady with tears to take every care of her.\r\n\r\nHaving thus placed the girl with one in whom he felt sure that he might\r\ntrust, he determined to tarry no longer in London; wherefore, taking Perrot\r\nwith him and begging as he went, he made his way to Wales, not without great\r\nsuffering, being unused to go afoot. Now in Wales another of the King's\r\nmarshals had his court, maintaining great state and a large number of\r\nretainers; to which court, the Count and his son frequently repaired, there\r\nto get food; and there Perrot, finding the marshal's son and other\r\ngentlemen's sons vying with one another in boyish exercises, as running and\r\nleaping, little by little joined their company, and shewed himself a match\r\nor more for them all in all their contests. The marshal's attention being\r\nthus drawn to him, he was well pleased with the boy's mien and bearing, and\r\nasked who he was. He was told that he was the son of a poor man who\r\nsometimes came there to solicit alms. Whereupon he asked the Count to let\r\nhim have the boy, and the Count, to whom God could have granted no greater\r\nboon, readily consented, albeit he was very loath to part with Perrot.\r\n\r\nHaving thus provided for his son and daughter, the Count resolved to quit\r\nthe island; and did so, making his way as best he could to Stamford, in\r\nIreland, where he obtained a menial's place in the service of a knight,\r\nretainer to one of the earls of that Country, and so abode there a long\r\nwhile, doing all the irksome and wearisome drudgery of a lackey or groom.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile under the care of the gentle lady at London Violante or Jeannette\r\nincreased, as in years and stature so also in beauty, and in such favour\r\nwith the lady and her husband and every other member of the household and\r\nall who knew her that 'twas a wonder to see; nor was there any that,\r\nobserving her bearing and manners, would not have said that estate or\r\ndignity there was none so high or honourable but she was worthy of it. So\r\nthe lady, who, since she had received her from her father, had been unable\r\nto learn aught else about him than what he had himself told, was minded to\r\nmarry her honourably according to what she deemed to be her rank. But God,\r\nwho justly apportions reward according to merit, having regard to her noble\r\nbirth, her innocence, and the load of suffering which the sin of another had\r\nlaid upon her, ordered otherwise; and in His good providence, lest the young\r\ngentlewoman should be mated with a churl, permitted, we must believe, events\r\nto take the course they did.\r\n\r\nThe gentle lady with whom Jeannette lived had an only son, whom she and her\r\nhusband loved most dearly, as well because he was a son as for his rare and\r\nnoble qualities, for in truth there were few that could compare with him in\r\ncourtesy and courage and personal beauty. Now the young man marked the\r\nextraordinary beauty and grace of Jeannette, who was about six years his\r\njunior, and fell so desperately in love with her that he had no eyes for any\r\nother maiden; but, deeming her to be of low degree, he not only hesitated to\r\nask her of his parents in marriage, but, fearing to incur reproof for\r\nindulging a passion for an inferior, he did his utmost to conceal his love.\r\nWhereby it gave him far more disquietude than if he had avowed it; insomuch\r\nthat--so extreme waxed his suffering--he fell ill, and that seriously.\r\nDivers physicians were called in, but, for all their scrutiny of his\r\nsymptoms, they could not determine the nature of his malady, and one and all\r\ngave him up for lost. Nothing could exceed the sorrow and dejection of his\r\nfather and mother, who again and again piteously implored him to discover to\r\nthem the cause of his malady, and received no other answer than sighs or\r\ncomplaints that he seemed to be wasting away. Now it so happened that one\r\nday, Jeannette, who from regard for his mother was sedulous in waiting upon\r\nhim, for some reason or another came into the room where he lay, while a\r\nvery young but very skilful physician sate by him and held his pulse. The\r\nyoung man gave her not a word or other sign of recognition; but his passion\r\nwaxed, his heart smote him, and the acceleration of his pulse at once\r\nbetrayed his inward commotion to the physician, who, albeit surprised,\r\nremained quietly attentive to see how long it would last, and observing that\r\nit ceased when Jeannette left the room, conjectured that he was on the way\r\nto explain the young man's malady. So, after a while, still holding the\r\nyoung man's pulse, he sent for Jeannette, as if he had something to ask of\r\nher. She returned forthwith; the young man's pulse mounted as soon as she\r\nentered the room, and fell again as soon as she left it. Wherefore the\r\nphysician no longer hesitated, but rose, and taking the young man's father\r\nand mother aside, said to them:--\"The restoration of your son's health rests\r\nnot with medical skill, but solely with Jeannette, whom, as by unmistakable\r\nsigns I have discovered, he ardently loves, though, so far I can see, she is\r\nnot aware of it. So you know what you have to do, if you value his life.\"\r\nThe prospect thus afforded of their son's deliverance from death reassured\r\nthe gentleman and his lady, albeit they were troubled, misdoubting it must\r\nbe by his marriage with Jeannette. So, when the physician was gone, they\r\nwent to the sick lad, and the lady thus spoke:--\"My son, never would I have\r\nbelieved that thou wouldst have concealed from me any desire of thine, least\r\nof all if such it were that privation should cause thee to languish; for\r\nwell assured thou shouldst have been and shouldst be, that I hold thee dear\r\nas my very self, and that whatever may be for thy contentment, even though\r\nit were scarce seemly, I would do it for thee; but, for all thou hast so\r\ndone, God has shewn Himself more merciful to theeward than thyself, and,\r\nlest thou die of this malady, has given me to know its cause, which is\r\nnothing else than the excessive love which thou bearest to a young woman, be\r\nshe who she may. Which love in good sooth thou needest not have been ashamed\r\nto declare; for it is but natural at thy age; and hadst thou not loved, I\r\nshould have deemed thee of very little worth. So, my son, be not shy of me,\r\nbut frankly discover to me thy whole heart; and away with this gloom and\r\nmelancholy whereof thy sickness is engendered, and be comforted, and assure\r\nthyself that there is nought that thou mayst require of me which I will not\r\ndo to give thee ease, so far as my powers may reach, seeing that thou art\r\ndearer to me than my own life. Away with thy shamefastness and fears, and\r\ntell me if there is aught wherein I may be helpful to thee in the matter of\r\nthy love; and if I bestir not myself and bring it to pass, account me the\r\nmost harsh mother that ever bore son.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man was at first somewhat shamefast to hear his mother thus speak,\r\nbut, reflecting that none could do more for his happiness than she, he took\r\ncourage, and thus spoke:--\"Madam, my sole reason for concealing my love from\r\nyou was that I have observed that old people for the most part forget that\r\nthey once were young; but, as I see that no such unreasonableness is to be\r\napprehended in you, I not only acknowledge the truth of what you say that\r\nyou have discerned, but I will also disclose to you the object of my\r\npassion, on the understanding that your promise shall to the best of your\r\npower be performed, as it must be, if I am to be restored to you in sound\r\nhealth.\" Whereupon the lady, making too sure of that which was destined to\r\nfall out otherwise than she expected, gave him every encouragement to\r\ndiscover all his heart, and promised to lose no time and spare no pains in\r\nendeavouring to compass his gratification. \"Madam,\" said then the young man,\r\n\"the rare beauty and exquisite manners of our Jeannette, my powerlessness to\r\nmake her understand--I do not say commiserate--my love, and my reluctance to\r\ndisclose it to any, have brought me to the condition in which you see me;\r\nand if your promise be not in one way or another performed, be sure that my\r\nlife will be brief.\" The lady, deeming that the occasion called rather for\r\ncomfort than for admonition, replied with a smile:--\"Ah! my son, was this\r\nthen of all things the secret of thy suffering? Be of good cheer, and leave\r\nme to arrange the affair, when you are recovered.\" So, animated by a\r\ncheerful hope, the young man speedily gave sign of a most marked\r\nimprovement, which the lady observed with great satisfaction, and then began\r\nto cast about how she might keep her promise. So one day she sent for\r\nJeannette, and in a tone of gentle raillery asked her if she had a lover.\r\nJeannette turned very red as she answered:--\"Madam, 'twould scarce, nay,\r\n'twould ill become a damsel such as I, poor, outcast from home, and in the\r\nservice of another, to occupy herself with thoughts of love.\" Whereto the\r\nlady answered:--\"So you have none, we will give you one, who will brighten\r\nall your life and give you more joy of your beauty; for it is not right that\r\nso fair a damsel as you remain without a lover.\" \"Madam,\" rejoined\r\nJeannette, \"you found me living in poverty with my father, you adopted me,\r\nyou have brought me up as your daughter; wherefore I should, if possible,\r\ncomply with your every wish; but in this matter I will render you no\r\ncompliance, nor do I doubt that I do well. So you will give me a husband, I\r\nwill love him, but no other will I love; for, as patrimony I now have none\r\nsave my honour, that I am minded to guard and preserve while my life shall\r\nlast.\" Serious though the obstacle was which these words opposed to the plan\r\nby which the lady had intended to keep her promise to her son, her sound\r\njudgment could not but secretly acknowledge that the spirit which they\r\nevinced was much to be commended in the damsel. Wherefore she said:--\"Nay\r\nbut, Jeannette; suppose that our Lord the King, who is a young knight as\r\nthou art a most fair damsel, craved some indulgence of thy love, wouldst\r\nthou deny him?\" \"The King,\" returned Jeannette without the least hesitation,\r\n\"might constrain me, but with my consent he should never have aught of me\r\nthat was not honourable.\" Whereto the lady made no answer, for she now\r\nunderstood the girl's temper; but, being minded to put her to the proof, she\r\ntold her son that, as soon as he was recovered, she would arrange that he\r\nshould be closeted with her in the same room, and be thus able to use all\r\nhis arts to bring her to his will, saying that it ill became her to play the\r\npart of procuress and urge her son's suit upon her own maid. But as the\r\nyoung man, by no means approving this idea, suddenly grew worse, the lady at\r\nlength opened her mind to Jeannette, whom she found in the same frame as\r\nbefore, and indeed even more resolute. Wherefore she told her husband all\r\nthat she had done; and as both preferred that their son should marry beneath\r\nhim, and live, than that he should remain single and die, they resolved,\r\nalbeit much disconcerted, to give Jeannette to him to wife; and so after\r\nlong debate they did. Whereat Jeannette was overjoyed, and with devout heart\r\ngave thanks to God that He had not forgotten her; nevertheless she still\r\ngave no other account of herself than that she was the daughter of a Picard.\r\nSo the young man recovered, and blithe at heart as ne'er another, was\r\nmarried, and began to speed the time gaily with his bride.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Perrot, left in Wales with the marshal of the King of England, had\r\nlikewise with increase of years increase of favour with his master, and grew\r\nup most shapely and well-favoured, and of such prowess that in all the\r\nisland at tourney or joust or any other passage of arms he had not his peer;\r\nbeing everywhere known and renowned as Perrot the Picard. And as God had not\r\nforgotten Jeannette, so likewise He made manifest by what follows that He\r\nhad not forgotten Perrot. Well-nigh half the population of those parts being\r\nswept off by a sudden visitation of deadly pestilence, most of the survivors\r\nfled therefrom in a panic, so that the country was, to all appearance,\r\nentirely deserted. Among those that died of the pest were the marshal, his\r\nlady, and his son, besides brothers and nephews and kinsfolk in great\r\nnumber; whereby of his entire household there were left only one of his\r\ndaughters, now marriageable, and a few servants, among them Perrot. Now\r\nPerrot being a man of such notable prowess, the damsel, soon after the\r\npestilence had spent itself, took him, with the approval and by the advice\r\nof the few folk that survived, to be her husband, and made him lord of all\r\nthat fell to her by inheritance. Nor was it long before the King of England,\r\nlearning that the marshal was dead, made Perrot the Picard, to whose merit\r\nhe was no stranger, marshal in the dead man's room. Such, in brief, was the\r\nhistory of the two innocent children, with whom the Count of Antwerp had\r\nparted, never expecting to see them again.\r\n\r\n'Twas now the eighteenth year since the Count of Antwerp had taken flight\r\nfrom Paris, when, being still in Ireland, where he had led a very sorry and\r\nsuffering sort of life, and feeling that age was now come upon him, he felt\r\na longing to learn, if possible, what was become of his children. The\r\nfashion of his outward man was now completely changed; for long hardship had\r\n(as he well knew) given to his age a vigour which his youth, lapped in ease,\r\nhad lacked. So he hesitated not to take his leave of the knight with whom he\r\nhad so long resided, and poor and in sorry trim he crossed to England, and\r\nmade his way to the place where he had left Perrot--to find him a great lord\r\nand marshal of the King, and in good health, and withal a hardy man and very\r\nhandsome. All which was very grateful to the old man; but yet he would not\r\nmake himself known to his son, until he had learned the fate of Jeannette.\r\nSo forth he fared again, nor did he halt until he was come to London, where,\r\ncautiously questing about for news of the lady with whom he had left his\r\ndaughter, and how it fared with her, he learned that Jeannette was married\r\nto the lady's son. Whereat, in the great gladness of his heart, he counted\r\nall his past adversity but a light matter, since he had found his children\r\nalive and prosperous. But sore he yearned to see Jeannette. Wherefore he\r\ntook to loitering, as poor folk are wont, in the neighbourhood of the house.\r\nAnd so one day Jacques Lamiens--such was the name of Jeannette's husband--\r\nsaw him and had pity on him, observing that he was poor and aged, and bade\r\none of his servants take him indoors, and for God's sake give him something\r\nto eat; and nothing loath the servant did so. Now Jeannette had borne\r\nJacques several children, the finest and the most winsome children in the\r\nworld, the eldest no more than eight years old; who gathered about the Count\r\nas he ate, and, as if by instinct divining that he was their grandfather,\r\nbegan to make friends with him. He, knowing them for his grandchildren,\r\ncould not conceal his love, and repaid them with caresses; insomuch that\r\nthey would not hearken to their governor when he called them, but remained\r\nwith the Count. Which being reported to Jeannette, she came out of her room,\r\ncrossed to where the Count was sitting with the children, and bade them do\r\nas their master told them, or she would certainly have them whipped. The\r\nchildren began to cry, and to say that they would rather stay with the\r\nworthy man, whom they liked much better than their master; whereat both the\r\nlady and the Count laughed in sympathy. The Count had risen, with no other\r\nintention--for he was not minded to disclose his paternity--than to pay his\r\ndaughter the respect due from his poverty to her rank, and the sight of her\r\nhad thrilled his soul with a wondrous delight. By her he was and remained\r\nunrecognised; utterly changed as he was from his former self; aged,\r\ngrey-haired, bearded, lean and tanned--in short to all appearance another\r\nman than the Count.\r\n\r\nHowever, seeing that the children were unwilling to leave him, but wept when\r\nshe made as if she would constrain them, she bade the master let them be for\r\na time. So the children remained with the worthy man, until by chance\r\nJacques' father came home, and learned from the master what had happened.\r\nWhereupon, having a grudge against Jeannette, he said:--\"Let them be; and\r\nGod give them the ill luck which He owes them: whence they sprang, thither\r\nthey must needs return; they descend from a vagabond on the mother's side,\r\nand so 'tis no wonder that they consort readily with vagabonds.\" The Count\r\ncaught these words and was sorely pained, but, shrugging his shoulders, bore\r\nthe affront silently as he had borne many another. Jacques, who had noted\r\nhis children's fondness for the worthy man, to wit, the Count, was\r\ndispleased; but nevertheless, such was the love he bore them, that, rather\r\nthan see them weep, he gave order that, if the worthy man cared to stay\r\nthere in his service, he should be received. The Count answered that he\r\nwould gladly do so, but that he was fit for nothing except to look after\r\nhorses, to which he had been used all his life. So a horse was assigned him,\r\nand when he had groomed him, he occupied himself in playing with the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nWhile Fortune thus shaped the destinies of the Count of Antwerp and his\r\nchildren, it so befell that after a long series of truces made with the\r\nGermans the King of France died, and his crown passed to his son, whose wife\r\nhad been the occasion of the Count's banishment. The new king, as soon as\r\nthe last truce with the Germans was run out, renewed hostilities with\r\nextraordinary vigour, being aided by his brother of England with a large\r\narmy under the command of his marshal, Perrot, and his other marshal's son,\r\nJacques Lamiens. With them went the worthy man, that is to say, the Count,\r\nwho, unrecognised by any, served for a long while in the army in the\r\ncapacity of groom, and acquitted himself both in counsel and in arms with a\r\nwisdom and valour unwonted in one of his supposed rank. The war was still\r\nraging when the Queen of France fell seriously ill, and, as she felt her end\r\napproach, made a humble and contrite confession of all her sins to the\r\nArchbishop of Rouen, who was universally reputed a good and most holy man.\r\nAmong her other sins she confessed the great wrong that she had done to the\r\nCount of Antwerp; nor was she satisfied to confide it to the Archbishop, but\r\nrecounted the whole affair, as it had passed, to not a few other worthy men,\r\nwhom she besought to use their influence with the King to procure the\r\nrestitution of the Count, if he were still alive, and if not, of his\r\nchildren, to honour and estate. And so, dying shortly afterwards, she was\r\nhonourably buried. The Queen's confession wrung from the King a sigh or two\r\nof compunction for a brave man cruelly wronged; after which he caused\r\nproclamation to be made throughout the army and in many other parts, that\r\nwhoso should bring him tidings of the Count of Antwerp, or his children,\r\nshould receive from him such a guerdon for each of them as should justly be\r\nmatter of marvel; seeing that he held him acquitted, by confession of the\r\nQueen, of the crime for which he had been banished, and was therefore now\r\nminded to grant him not only restitution but increase of honour and estate.\r\n\r\nNow the Count, being still with the army in his character of groom, heard\r\nthe proclamation, which he did not doubt was made in good faith. Wherefore\r\nhe hied him forthwith to Jacques, and begged a private interview with him\r\nand Perrot, that he might discover to them that whereof the King was in\r\nquest. So the meeting was had; and Perrot was on the point of declaring\r\nhimself, when the Count anticipated him:--\"Perrot,\" he said, \"Jacques here\r\nhas thy sister to wife, but never a dowry had he with her. Wherefore that\r\nthy sister be not dowerless, 'tis my will that he, and no other, have this\r\ngreat reward which the King offers for thee, son, as he shall certify, of\r\nthe Count of Antwerp, and for his wife and thy sister, Violante, and for me,\r\nCount of Antwerp, thy father.\" So hearing, Perrot scanned the Count closely,\r\nand forthwith recognising him, burst into tears, and throwing himself at his\r\nfeet embraced him, saying:--\"My father, welcome, welcome indeed art thou.\"\r\nWhereupon, between what he had heard from the Count and what he had\r\nwitnessed on the part of Perrot, Jacques was so overcome with wonder and\r\ndelight, that at first he was at a loss to know how to act. However, giving\r\nentire credence to what he had heard, and recalling insulting language which\r\nhe had used towards the quondam groom, the Count, he was sore stricken with\r\nshame, and wept, and fell at the Count's feet, and humbly craved his pardon\r\nfor all past offences; which the Count, raising him to his feet, most\r\ngraciously granted him. So with many a tear and many a hearty laugh the\r\nthree men compared their several fortunes; which done, Perrot and Jacques\r\nwould have arrayed the Count in manner befitting his rank, but he would by\r\nno means suffer it, being minded that Jacques, so soon as he was well\r\nassured that the guerdon was forthcoming, should present him to the King in\r\nhis garb of groom, that thereby the King might be the more shamed. So\r\nJacques, with the Count and Perrot, went presently to the King and offered\r\nto present to him the Count and his children, provided the guerdon were\r\nforthcoming according to the proclamation. Jacques wondered not a little as\r\nforthwith at a word from the King a guerdon was produced ample for all\r\nthree, and he was bidden take it away with him, so only that he should in\r\nvery truth produce, as he had promised, the Count and his children in the\r\nroyal presence. Then, withdrawing a little and causing his quondam groom,\r\nnow Count, to come forward with Perrot, he said:--\"Sire, father and son are\r\nbefore you; the daughter, my wife, is not here, but, God willing, you shall\r\nsoon see her.\" So hearing, the King surveyed the Count, whom,\r\nnotwithstanding his greatly changed appearance, he at length recognised, and\r\nwell-nigh moved to tears, he raised him from his knees to his feet, and\r\nkissed and embraced him. He also gave a kindly welcome to Perrot, and bade\r\nforthwith furnish the Count with apparel, servants and horses, suited to his\r\nrank; all which was no sooner said than done. Moreover the King shewed\r\nJacques no little honour, and particularly questioned him of all his past\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\nAs Jacques was about to take the noble guerdons assigned him for the\r\ndiscovery of the Count and his children, the Count said to him:--\"Take these\r\ntokens of the magnificence of our Lord the King, and forget not to tell thy\r\nfather that 'tis from no vagabond that thy children, his and my\r\ngrandchildren, descend on the mother's side.\" So Jacques took the guerdons,\r\nand sent for his wife and mother to join him at Paris. Thither also came\r\nPerrot's wife: and there with all magnificence they were entertained by the\r\nCount, to whom the King had not only restored all his former estates and\r\nhonours, but added thereto others, whereby he was now become a greater man\r\nthan he had ever been before. Then with the Count's leave they all returned\r\nto their several houses. The Count himself spent the rest of his days at\r\nParis in greater glory than ever.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL IX.\r\n\r\n--\r\nBernabo of Genoa, deceived by Ambrogiuolo, loses his money and commands his\r\ninnocent wife to be put to death. She escapes, habits herself as a man, and\r\nserves the Soldan. She discovers the deceiver, and brings Bernabo to\r\nAlexandria, where the deceiver is punished. She then resumes the garb of a\r\nwoman, and with her husband returns wealthy to Genoa.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen Elisa had performed her part, and brought her touching story to a\r\nclose, Queen Philomena, a damsel no less stately than fair of person, and of\r\na surpassingly sweet and smiling mien, having composed herself to speak,\r\nthus began:--\r\n\r\nOur engagements with Dioneo shall be faithfully observed; wherefore, as he\r\nand I alone remain to complete the day's narration, I will tell my story\r\nfirst, and he shall have the grace he craved, and be the last to speak.\r\nAfter which prelude she thus began her story:--'Tis a proverb current among\r\nthe vulgar that the deceived has the better of the deceiver; a proverb\r\nwhich, were it not exemplified by events, might hardly in any manner be\r\njustified. Wherefore, while adhering to our theme, I am minded at the same\r\ntime dearest ladies to shew you that there is truth in this proverb; the\r\nproof whereof should be none the less welcome to you that it may put you on\r\nyour guard against deceivers.\r\n\r\nKnow then that certain very great merchants of Italy, being met, as\r\nmerchants use, for divers reasons proper to each, at a hostelry in Paris,\r\nand having one evening jovially supped together, fell a talking of divers\r\nmatters, and so, passing from one topic to another, they came at last to\r\ndiscuss the ladies whom they had left at home, and one jocosely said:--\"I\r\ncannot answer for my wife; but for myself I own, that, whenever a girl that\r\nis to my mind comes in my way, I give the go-by to the love that I bear my\r\nwife, and take my pleasure of the new-comer to the best of my power.\" \"And\r\nso do I,\" said another, \"because I know that, whether I suspect her or no,\r\nmy wife tries her fortune, and so 'tis do as you are done by; the ass and\r\nthe wall are quits.\" A third added his testimony to the same effect; and in\r\nshort all seemed to concur in the opinion that the ladies they had left\r\nbehind them were not likely to neglect their opportunities, when one, a\r\nGenoese, Bernabo Lomellin by name, dissociated himself from the rest,\r\naffirming that by especial grace of God he was blessed with a wife who was,\r\nperhaps, the most perfect paragon to be found in Italy of all the virtues\r\nproper to a lady, ay, and in great measure, to a knight or squire; inasmuch\r\nas she was fair, still quite young, handy, hardy, and clever beyond all\r\nother women in embroidery work and all other forms of lady's handicraft.\r\nMoreover so well-mannered, discreet and sensible was she that she was as fit\r\nto wait at a lord's table as any squire or manservant or such like, the best\r\nand most adroit that could be found. To which encomium he added that she\r\nknew how to manage a horse, fly a hawk, read, write and cast up accounts\r\nbetter than as if she were a merchant; and after much more in the same\r\nstrain of commendation he came at length to the topic of their conversation,\r\nasseverating with an oath that 'twas not possible to find a woman more\r\nhonest, more chaste than she: nay, he verily believed that, if he remained\r\nfrom home for ten years, or indeed for the rest of his days, she would never\r\nthink of any of these casual amours with any other man.\r\n\r\nAmong the merchants who thus gossiped was a young man, Ambrogiuolo da\r\nPiacenza, by name, who, when Bernabo thus concluded his eulogy of his wife,\r\nbroke out into a mighty laugh, and asked him with a leer, whether he of all\r\nmen had this privilege by special patent of the Emperor. Bernabo replied,\r\nsomewhat angrily, that 'twas a boon conferred upon him by God, who was\r\nrather more powerful than the Emperor. To which Ambrogiuolo rejoined:--\"I\r\nmake no doubt, Bernabo, that thou believest that what thou sayst is true;\r\nbut, methinks, thou hast been but a careless observer of the nature of\r\nthings; otherwise, I do not take thee to be of so gross understanding but\r\nthat thou must have discerned therein reasons for speaking more judiciously\r\nof this matter. And that thou mayst not think that we, who have spoken with\r\nmuch freedom about our wives, deem them to be of another nature and mould\r\nthan thine, but mayst know that we have but uttered what common sense\r\ndictates, I am minded to go a little further into this matter with thee. I\r\nhave always understood, that of all mortal beings created by God man is the\r\nmost noble, and next after him woman: man, then, being, as is universally\r\nbelieved, and is indeed apparent by his works, more perfect than woman, must\r\nwithout doubt be endowed with more firmness and constancy, women being one\r\nand all more mobile, for reasons not a few and founded in nature, which I\r\nmight adduce, but mean for the present to pass over. And yet, for all his\r\ngreater firmness, man cannot withstand--I do not say a woman's\r\nsupplications, but--the mere lust of the eye which she unwittingly excites,\r\nand that in such sort that he will do all that is in his power to induce her\r\nto pleasure him, not once, perhaps, in the course of a month, but a thousand\r\ntimes a day. How, then, shouldst thou expect a woman, mobile by nature, to\r\nresist the supplications, the flatteries, the gifts, and all the other modes\r\nof attack that an accomplished seducer will employ? Thou thinkest that she\r\nmay hold out! Nay verily, affirm it as thou mayst, I doubt thou dost not\r\nreally so think. Thou dost not deny that thy wife is a woman, a creature of\r\nflesh and blood like the rest; and if so, she must have the same cravings,\r\nthe same natural propensities as they, and no more force to withstand them;\r\nwherefore 'tis at least possible, that, however honest she be, she will do\r\nas others do; and nought that is possible admits such peremptory denial or\r\naffirmation of its contrary as this of thine.\"\r\n\r\nWhereto Bernabo returned--\"I am a merchant and no philosopher, and I will\r\ngive thee a merchant's answer. I acknowledge that what thou sayst is true of\r\nvain and foolish women who have no modesty, but such as are discreet are so\r\nsensitive in regard of their honour that they become better able to preserve\r\nit than men, who have no such solicitude; and my wife is one of this sort.\"\r\n\"Doubtless,\" observed Ambrogiuolo, \"few would be found to indulge in these\r\ncasual amours, if every time they did so a horn grew out on the brow to\r\nattest the fact; but not only does no horn make its appearance but not so\r\nmuch as a trace or vestige of a horn, so only they be but prudent; and the\r\nshame and dishonour consist only in the discovery: wherefore, if they can do\r\nit secretly, they do it, or are fools to refrain. Hold it for certain that\r\nshe alone is chaste who either had never suit made to her, or, suing\r\nherself, was repulsed. And albeit I know that for reasons true and founded\r\nin nature this must needs be, yet I should not speak so positively thereof\r\nas I do, had I not many a time with many a woman verified it by experience.\r\nAnd I assure thee that, had I but access to this most saintly wife of thine,\r\nI should confidently expect very soon to have the same success with her as\r\nwith others.\" Then Bernabo angrily:--\"'Twere long and tedious to continue\r\nthis discussion. I should have my say, and thou thine, and in the end\r\n'twould come to nothing. But, as thou sayst that they are all so compliant,\r\nand that thou art so accomplished a seducer, I give thee this pledge of the\r\nhonour of my wife: I consent to forfeit my head, if thou shouldst succeed in\r\nbringing her to pleasure thee in such a sort; and shouldst thou fail, thou\r\nshalt forfeit to me no more than one thousand florins of gold.\"\r\n\r\nElated by this unexpected offer, Ambrogiuolo replied:--\"I know not what I\r\nshould do with thy blood, Bernabo, if I won the wager; but, if thou wouldst\r\nhave proof of what I have told thee, lay five thousand florins of gold,\r\nwhich must be worth less to thee than thy head, against a thousand of mine,\r\nand, whereas thou makest no stipulation as to time, I will bind myself to go\r\nto Genoa, and within three months from my departure hence to have had my\r\npleasure of thy wife, and in witness thereof to bring back with me, of the\r\nthings which she prizes most dearly, evidence of her compliance so weighty\r\nand conclusive that thou thyself shalt admit the fact; nor do I require\r\nought of thee but that thou pledge thy faith neither to come to Genoa nor to\r\nwrite word to her of this matter during the said three months.\" Bernabo\r\nprofessed himself well content; and though the rest of the company, seeing\r\nthat the compact might well have very evil consequences, did all that they\r\ncould to frustrate it, yet the two men were now so heated that, against the\r\nwill of the others, they set it down fairly in writing, and signed it each\r\nwith his own hand. This done, Ambrogiuolo, leaving Bernabo at Paris, posted\r\nwith all speed for Genoa. Arrived there, he set to work with great caution;\r\nand having found out the quarter in which the lady resided, he learned in\r\nthe course of a few days enough about her habits of life and her character\r\nto know that what Bernabo had told him was rather less than the truth. So,\r\nrecognising that his enterprise was hopeless, he cast about for some device\r\nwhereby he might cover his defeat; and having got speech of a poor woman,\r\nwho was much in the lady's house, as also in her favour, he bribed her\r\n(other means failing) to convey him in a chest, which he had had made for\r\nthe purpose, not only into the house but into the bedroom of the lady, whom\r\nthe good woman, following Bernabo's instructions, induced to take charge of\r\nit for some days, during which, she said, she would be away.\r\n\r\nSo the lady suffered the chest to remain in the room; and when the night was\r\nso far spent that Bernabo thought she must be asleep, he opened it with some\r\ntools with which he had provided himself, and stole softly out. There was a\r\nlight in the room, so that he was able to form an idea of its situation, to\r\ntake note of the pictures and everything else of consequence that it\r\ncontained, and to commit the whole to memory. This done, he approached the\r\nbed; and observing that the lady, and a little girl that was with her, were\r\nfast asleep, he gently uncovered her, and saw that nude she was not a whit\r\nless lovely than when dressed: he looked about for some mark that might\r\nserve him as evidence that he had seen her in this state, but found nothing\r\nexcept a mole, which she had under the left breast, and which was fringed\r\nwith a few fair hairs that shone like gold. So beautiful was she that he was\r\ntempted at the hazard of his life to take his place by her side in the bed;\r\nbut, remembering what he had heard of her inflexible obduracy in such\r\naffairs, he did not venture; but quietly replaced the bedclothes; and having\r\npassed the best part of the night very much at his ease in her room, he took\r\nfrom one of the lady's boxes a purse, a gown, a ring and a girdle, and with\r\nthese tokens returned to the chest, and locked himself in as before. In this\r\nmanner he passed two nights, nor did the lady in the least suspect his\r\npresence. On the third day the good woman came by preconcert to fetch her\r\nchest, and took it back to the place whence she had brought it. So\r\nAmbrogiuolo got out, paid her the stipulated sum, and hied him back with all\r\nspeed to Paris, where he arrived within the appointed time. Then, in\r\npresence of the merchants who were witnesses of his altercation with\r\nBernabo, and the wager to which it had given occasion, he told Bernabo that\r\nhe had won the bet, having done what he had boasted that he would do; and in\r\nproof thereof he first of all described the appearance of the room and the\r\npictures, and then displayed the articles belonging to the lady which he had\r\nbrought away with him, averring that she had given them to him. Bernabo\r\nacknowledged the accuracy of his description of the room, and that the\r\narticles did really belong to his wife, but objected that Ambrogiuolo might\r\nhave learned characteristic features of the room from one of the servants,\r\nand have come by the things in a similar way, and therefore, unless he had\r\nsomething more to say, he could not justly claim to have won the bet.\r\n\"Verily,\" rejoined Ambrogiuolo, \"this should suffice; but, as thou requirest\r\nthat I say somewhat further, I will satisfy thee. I say, then, that Madam\r\nZinevra, thy wife, has under her left breast a mole of some size, around\r\nwhich are, perhaps, six hairs of a golden hue.\" As Bernabo heard this, it\r\nwas as if a knife pierced his heart, so poignant was his suffering; and,\r\nthough no word escaped him, the complete alteration of his mien bore\r\nunmistakable witness to the truth of Ambrogiuolo's words. After a while he\r\nsaid:--\"Gentlemen, 'tis even as Ambrogiuolo says; he has won the bet; he has\r\nbut to come when he will, and he shall be paid.\" And so the very next day\r\nAmbrogiuolo was paid in full, and Bernabo, intent on wreaking vengeance on\r\nhis wife, left Paris and set his face towards Genoa. He had no mind,\r\nhowever, to go home, and accordingly halted at an estate which he had some\r\ntwenty miles from the city, whither he sent forward a servant, in whom he\r\nreposed much trust, with two horses and a letter advising the lady of his\r\nreturn, and bidding her come out to meet him. At the same time he gave the\r\nservant secret instructions to choose some convenient place, and ruthlessly\r\nput the lady to death, and so return to him. On his arrival at Genoa the\r\nservant delivered his message and the letter to the lady, who received him\r\nwith great cheer, and next morning got on horseback and set forth with him\r\nfor her husband's estate. So they rode on, talking of divers matters, until\r\nthey came to a deep gorge, very lonely, and shut in by high rocks and trees.\r\nThe servant, deeming this just the place in which he might without risk of\r\ndiscovery fulfil his lord's behest, whipped out a knife, and seizing the\r\nlady by the arm, said:--\"Madam, commend your soul to God, for here must end\r\nat once your journey and your life.\" Terror-stricken by what she saw and\r\nheard, the lady cried out:--\"Mercy for God's sake; before thou slay me, tell\r\nme at least wherein I have wronged thee, that thou art thus minded to put me\r\nto death.\" \"Madam,\" said the servant, \"me you have in no wise wronged; but\r\nyour husband--how you may have wronged him I know not--charged me shew you\r\nno mercy, but to slay you on this journey, and threatened to have me hanged\r\nby the neck, should I not do so. You know well how bound I am to him, and\r\nthat I may not disobey any of his commands: God knows I pity you, but yet I\r\ncan no otherwise.\" Whereat the lady burst into tears, saying:--\"Mercy for\r\nGod's sake; make not thyself the murderer of one that has done thee no\r\nwrong, at the behest of another. The all-seeing God knows that I never did\r\naught to merit such requital at my husband's hands. But enough of this for\r\nthe present: there is a way in which thou canst serve at once God and thy\r\nmaster and myself, if thou wilt do as I bid thee: take, then, these clothes\r\nof mine and give me in exchange just thy doublet and a hood; and carry the\r\nclothes with thee to my lord and thine, and tell him that thou hast slain\r\nme; and I swear to thee by the life which I shall have received at thy\r\nhands, that I will get me gone, and there abide whence news of me shall\r\nnever reach either him or thee or these parts.\" The servant, being loath to\r\nput her to death, soon yielded to pity; and so he took her clothes, allowing\r\nher to retain a little money that she had, and gave her one of his worser\r\ndoublets and a hood; then, praying her to depart the country, he left her\r\nafoot in the gorge, and returned to his master, whom he gave to understand\r\nthat he had not only carried out his orders but had left the lady's body a\r\nprey to wolves. Bernabo after a while returned to Genoa, where, the supposed\r\nmurder being bruited abroad, he was severely censured.\r\n\r\nAlone and disconsolate, the lady, as night fell, disguised herself as best\r\nshe could, and hied her to a neighbouring village, where, having procured\r\nwhat was needful from an old woman, she shortened the doublet and fitted it\r\nto her figure, converted her chemise into a pair of breeches, cut her hair\r\nclose, and, in short, completely disguised herself as a sailor. She then\r\nmade her way to the coast, where by chance she encountered a Catalan\r\ngentleman, by name Segner Encararch, who had landed from one of his ships,\r\nwhich lay in the offing, to recreate himself at Alba, where there was a\r\nfountain. So she made overture to him of her services, was engaged and taken\r\naboard the ship, assuming the name Sicurano da Finale. The gentleman put her\r\nin better trim as to clothes, and found her so apt and handy at service that\r\nhe was exceeding well pleased with her.\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards the Catalan sailed one of his carracks to Alexandria. He\r\ntook with him some peregrine falcons, which he presented to the Soldan, who\r\nfeasted him once or twice; and noting with approbation the behaviour of\r\nSicurano, who always attended his master, he craved him of the Catalan,\r\nwhich request the Catalan reluctantly granted. Sicurano proved so apt for\r\nhis new service that he was soon as high in grace and favour with the Soldan\r\nas he had been with the Catalan. Wherefore, when the time of year came at\r\nwhich there was wont to be held at Acre, then under the Soldan's sway, a\r\ngreat fair, much frequented by merchants, Christian and Saracen alike, and\r\nto which, for the security of the merchants and their goods, the Soldan\r\nalways sent one of his great officers of state with other officers and a\r\nguard to attend upon them, he determined to send Sicurano, who by this time\r\nknew the language very well. So Sicurano was sent to Acre as governor and\r\ncaptain of the guard for the protection of the merchants and merchandise.\r\nArrived there, he bestirred himself with great zeal in all matters\r\nappertaining to his office; and as he went his rounds of inspection, he\r\nespied among the merchants not a few from Italy, Sicilians, Pisans, Genoese,\r\nVenetians, and so forth, with whom he consorted the more readily because\r\nthey reminded him of his native land. And so it befell that, alighting once\r\nat a shop belonging to some Venetian merchants, he saw there among other\r\ntrinkets a purse and a girdle, which he forthwith recognised as having once\r\nbeen his own. Concealing his surprise, he blandly asked whose they were, and\r\nif they were for sale. He was answered by Ambrogiuolo da Piacenza, who had\r\ncome thither with much merchandise aboard a Venetian ship, and hearing that\r\nthe captain of the guard was asking about the ownership of the purse and\r\ngirdle, came forward, and said with a smile:--\"The things are mine, Sir, and\r\nI am not disposed to sell them, but, if they take your fancy, I will gladly\r\ngive them to you.\" Observing the smile, Sicurano misdoubted that something\r\nhad escaped him by which Ambrogiuolo had recognised him; but he answered\r\nwith a composed air:--\"Thou dost smile, perchance, to see me, a soldier,\r\ncome asking about this woman's gear?\" \"Not so, Sir,\" returned Ambrogiuolo;\r\n\"I smile to think of the manner in which I came by it.\" \"And pray,\" said\r\nSicurano, \"if thou hast no reason to conceal it, tell me, in God's name, how\r\nthou didst come by the things.\" \" Why, Sir,\" said Ambrogiuolo, \"they were\r\ngiven me by a Genoese lady, with whom I once spent a night, Madam Zinevra by\r\nname, wife of Bernabo Lomellin, who prayed me to keep them as a token of her\r\nlove. I smiled just now to think of the folly of Bernabo, who was so mad as\r\nto stake five thousand florins of gold, against my thousand that I could not\r\nbring his wife to surrender to me; which I did. I won the bet; and he, who\r\nshould rather have been punished for his insensate folly, than she for doing\r\nwhat all women do, had her put to death, as I afterwards gathered, on his\r\nway back from Paris to Genoa.\"\r\n\r\nAmbrogiuolo had not done speaking before Sicurano had discerned in him the\r\nevident cause of her husband's animosity against her, and all her woe, and\r\nhad made up her mind that he should not escape with impunity. She therefore\r\nfeigned to be much interested by this story, consorted frequently and very\r\nfamiliarly with Ambrogiuolo, and insidiously captured his confidence,\r\ninsomuch that at her suggestion, when the fair was done, he, taking with him\r\nall his wares, accompanied her to Alexandria, where she provided him with a\r\nshop, and put no little of her own money in his hands; so that he, finding\r\nit very profitable, was glad enough to stay. Anxious to make her innocence\r\nmanifest to Bernabo, Sicurano did not rest until, with the help of some\r\ngreat Genoese merchants that were in Alexandria, she had devised an\r\nexpedient to draw him thither. Her plan succeeded; Bernabo arrived; and, as\r\nhe was now very poor, she privily arranged that he should be entertained by\r\none of her friends until occasion should serve to carry out her design. She\r\nhad already induced Ambrogiuolo to tell his story to the Soldan, and the\r\nSoldan to interest himself in the matter. So Bernabo being come, and further\r\ndelay inexpedient, she seized her opportunity, and persuaded the Soldan to\r\ncite Ambrogiuolo and Bernabo before him, that in Bernabo's presence\r\nAmbrogiuolo might be examined of his boast touching Bernabo's wife, and the\r\ntruth hereof, if not to be had from him by gentle means, be elicited by\r\ntorture. So the Soldan, having Ambrogiuolo and Bernabo before him, amid a\r\ngreat concourse of his people questioned Ambrogiuolo of the five thousand\r\nflorins of gold that he had won from Bernabo, and sternly bade him tell the\r\ntruth. Still more harsh was the aspect of Sicurano, in whom Ambrogiuolo had\r\nplaced his chief reliance, but who now threatened him with the direst\r\ntorments if the truth were not forthcoming. Thus hard bested on this side\r\nand on that, and in a manner coerced, Ambrogiuolo, thinking he had but to\r\nrefund, in presence of Bernabo and many others accurately recounted the\r\naffair as it had happened. When he had done, Sicurano, as minister of the\r\nSoldan for the time being, turned to Bernabo and said:--\"And thy wife, thus\r\nfalsely accused, what treatment did she meet with at thy hands?\"\r\n\"Mortified,\" said Bernabo, \"by the loss of my money, and the dishonour which\r\nI deemed to have been done me by my wife, I was so overcome by wrath that I\r\nhad her put to death by one of my servants, who brought me word that her\r\ncorpse had been instantly devoured by a pack of wolves.\"\r\n\r\nAlbeit the Soldan had heard and understood all that had passed, yet he did\r\nnot as yet apprehend the object for which Sicurano had pursued the\r\ninvestigation. Wherefore Sicurano thus addressed him:--\"My lord, what cause\r\nthis good lady has to boast of her lover and her husband you have now\r\nabundant means of judging; seeing that the lover at one and the same time\r\ndespoils her of her honour, blasting her fair fame with slanderous\r\naccusations, and ruins her husband; who, more prompt to trust the falsehood\r\nof another than the verity of which his own long experience should have\r\nassured him, devotes her to death and the devouring wolves; and, moreover,\r\nsuch is the regard, such the love which both bear her that, though both\r\ntarry a long time with her, neither recognises her. However, that you may\r\nknow full well what chastisements they have severally deserved, I will now\r\ncause her to appear in your presence and theirs, provided you, of your\r\nespecial grace, be pleased to punish the deceiver and pardon the deceived.\"\r\nThe Soldan, being minded in this matter to defer entirely to Sicurano,\r\nanswered that he was well content, and bade produce the lady. Bernabo, who\r\nhad firmly believed that she was dead, was lost in wonder; likewise\r\nAmbrogiuolo, who now divined his evil plight, and dreading something worse\r\nthan the disbursement of money, knew not whether to expect the lady's advent\r\nwith fear or with hope. His suspense was not of long duration; for, as soon\r\nas the Soldan signified his assent, Sicurano, weeping, threw herself on her\r\nknees at his feet, and discarding the tones, as she would fain have divested\r\nherself of the outward semblance, of a man, said:--\"My lord, that forlorn,\r\nhapless Zinevra am I, falsely and foully slandered by this traitor\r\nAmbrogiuolo, and by my cruel and unjust husband delivered over to his\r\nservant to slaughter and cast out as a prey to the wolves; for which cause I\r\nhave now for six years been a wanderer on the face of the earth in the guise\r\nof a man.\" Then rending her robes in front and baring her breast, she made\r\nit manifest to the Soldan and all others who were present, that she was\r\nindeed a woman; then turning to Ambrogiuolo she haughtily challenged him to\r\nsay when she had ever lain with him, as he had boasted. Ambrogiuolo said\r\nnever a word, for he now recognised her, and it was as if shame had reft\r\nfrom him the power of speech. The Soldan, who had never doubted that\r\nSicurano was a man, was so wonder-struck by what he saw and heard that at\r\ntimes he thought it must be all a dream. But, as wonder gave place to\r\nconviction of the truth, he extolled in the amplest terms the constancy and\r\nvirtue and seemliness with which Zinevra, erstwhile Sicurano, had ordered\r\nher life. He then directed that she should be most nobly arrayed in the garb\r\nof her sex and surrounded by a bevy of ladies. Mindful of her intercession,\r\nhe granted to Bernabo the life which he had forfeited; and she, when Bernabo\r\nthrew himself at her feet and wept and craved her pardon, raised him,\r\nunworthy though he was, to his feet and generously forgave him, and tenderly\r\nembraced him as her husband. Ambrogiuolo the Soldan commanded to be bound to\r\na stake, that his bare flesh, anointed with honey, might be exposed to the\r\nsun on one of the heights of the city, there to remain until it should fall\r\nto pieces of its own accord: and so 'twas done. He then decreed that the\r\nlady should have the traitor's estate, which was worth not less but rather\r\nmore than ten thousand doubloons; whereto he added, in jewels and vessels of\r\ngold and silver and in money, the equivalent of upwards of other ten\r\nthousand doubloons, having first entertained her and her husband with most\r\nmagnificent and ceremonious cheer, accordant with the lady's worth. Which\r\ndone, he placed a ship at their disposal, and gave them leave to return to\r\nGenoa at their pleasure. So to Genoa they returned very rich and happy, and\r\nwere received with all honour, especially Madam Zinevra, whom all the\r\ncitizens had believed to be dead, and whom thenceforth, so long as she\r\nlived, they held of great consequence and excellency. As for Ambrogiuolo,\r\nthe very same day that he was bound to the stake, the honey with which his\r\nbody was anointed attracted such swarms of flies, wasps and gadflies,\r\nwherewith that country abounds, that not only was his life sucked from him\r\nbut his very bones were completely denuded of flesh; in which state, hanging\r\nby the sinews, they remained a long time undisturbed, for a sign and a\r\ntestimony of his baseness to all that passed by. And so the deceived had the\r\nbetter of the deceiver.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL X.\r\n\r\n--\r\nPaganino da Monaco carries off the wife of Messer Ricciardo di Chinzica,\r\nwho, having learned where she is, goes to Paganino and in a friendly manner\r\nasks him to restore her. He consents, provided she be willing. She refuses\r\nto go back with her husband. Messer Ricciardo dies, and she marries\r\nPaganino.\r\n--\r\n\r\nTheir queen's story, by its beauty, elicited hearty commendation from all\r\nthe honourable company, and most especially from Dioneo, with whom it now\r\nrested to conclude the day's narration. Again and again he renewed his\r\neulogy of the queen's story; and then began on this wise:--\r\n\r\nFair ladies, there is that in the queen's story which has caused me to\r\nchange my purpose, and substitute another story for that which I had meant\r\nto tell: I refer to the insensate folly of Bernabo (well though it was with\r\nhim in the end) and of all others who delude themselves, as he seemed to do,\r\nwith the vain imagination that, while they go about the world, taking their\r\npleasure now of this, now of the other woman, their wives, left at home,\r\nsuffer not their hands to stray from their girdles; as if we who are born of\r\nthem and bred among them, could be ignorant of the bent of their desires.\r\nWherefore, by my story I purpose at one and the same time to shew you how\r\ngreat is the folly of all such, and how much greater is the folly of those\r\nwho, deeming themselves mightier than nature, think by sophistical arguments\r\nto bring that to pass which is beyond their power, and strive might and main\r\nto conform others to their own pattern, however little the nature of the\r\nlatter may brook such treatment. Know then that there was in Pisa a judge,\r\nbetter endowed with mental than with physical vigour, by name Messer\r\nRicciardo di Chinzica, who, being minded to take a wife, and thinking,\r\nperhaps, to satisfy her by the same resources which served him for his\r\nstudies, was to be suited with none that had not both youth and beauty,\r\nqualities which he would rather have eschewed, if he had known how to give\r\nhimself as good counsel as he gave to others. However, being very rich, he\r\nhad his desire. Messer Lotto Gualandi gave him in marriage one of his\r\ndaughters, Bartolomea by name, a maid as fair and fit for amorous dalliance\r\nas any in Pisa, though few maids be there that do not shew as spotted\r\nlizards. The judge brought her home with all pomp and ceremony, and had a\r\nbrave and lordly wedding; but in the essay which he made the very first\r\nnight to serve her so as to consummate the marriage he made a false move,\r\nand drew the game much to his own disadvantage; for next morning his lean,\r\nwithered and scarce animate frame was only to be re-quickened by draughts of\r\nvernaccia,(1) artificial restoratives and the like remedies. So, taking a\r\nmore sober estimate of his powers than he had been wont, the worthy judge\r\nbegan to give his wife lessons from a calendar, which might have served as a\r\nhorn-book, and perhaps had been put together at Ravenna(2) inasmuch as,\r\naccording to his shewing, there was not a day in the year but was sacred,\r\nnot to one saint only, but to many; in honour of whom for divers reasons it\r\nbehoved men and women to abstain from carnal intercourse; whereto he added\r\nfast-days, Ember-days, vigils of Apostles and other saints, Friday,\r\nSaturday, Sunday, the whole of Lent, certain lunar mansions, and many other\r\nexceptions, arguing perchance, that the practice of men with women abed\r\nshould have its times of vacation no less than the administration of the\r\nlaw. In this method, which caused the lady grievous dumps, he long\r\npersisted, hardly touching her once a month, and observing her closely, lest\r\nanother should give her to know working-days, as he had taught her holidays.\r\n\r\nNow it so befell that, one hot season, Messer Ricciardo thought he would\r\nlike to visit a very beautiful estate which he had near Monte Nero, there to\r\ntake the air and recreate himself for some days, and thither accordingly he\r\nwent with his fair lady. While there, to amuse her, he arranged for a day's\r\nfishing; and so, he in one boat with the fishermen, and she in another with\r\nother ladies, they put out to watch the sport, which they found so\r\ndelightsome, that almost before they knew where they were they were some\r\nmiles out to sea. And while they were thus engrossed with the sport, a\r\ngalliot of Paganino da Mare, a very famous corsair of those days, hove in\r\nsight and bore down upon the boats, and, for all the speed they made, came\r\nup with that in which were the ladies; and on sight of the fair lady\r\nPaganino, regardless of all else, bore her off to his galliot before the\r\nvery eyes of Messer Ricciardo, who was by this time ashore, and forthwith\r\nwas gone. The chagrin of the judge, who was jealous of the very air, may\r\nreadily be imagined. But 'twas to no purpose that, both at Pisa and\r\nelsewhere, he moaned and groaned over the wickedness of the corsairs, for he\r\nknew neither by whom his wife had been abducted, nor whither she had been\r\ntaken. Paganino, meanwhile, deemed himself lucky to have gotten so beautiful\r\na prize; and being unmarried, he was minded never to part with her, and\r\naddressed himself by soft words to soothe the sorrow which kept her in a\r\nflood of tears. Finding words of little avail, he at night passed--the more\r\nreadily that the calendar had slipped from his girdle, and all feasts and\r\nholidays from his mind--to acts of love, and on this wise administered\r\nconsolation so effective that before they were come to Monaco she had\r\ncompletely forgotten the judge and his canons, and had begun to live with\r\nPaganino as merrily as might be. So he brought her to Monaco, where, besides\r\nthe daily and nightly solace which he gave her, he honourably entreated her\r\nas his wife.\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards Messer Ricciardo coming to know where his wife was, and\r\nbeing most ardently desirous to have her back, and thinking none but he\r\nwould understand exactly what to do in the circumstances, determined to go\r\nand fetch her himself, being prepared to spend any sum of money that might\r\nbe demanded by way of ransom. So he took ship, and being come to Monaco, he\r\nboth saw her and was seen by her; which news she communicated to Paganino in\r\nthe evening, and told him how she was minded to behave. Next morning Messer\r\nRicciardo, encountering Paganino, made up to him; and soon assumed a very\r\nfamiliar and friendly air, while Paganino pretended not to know him, being\r\non his guard to see what he would be at. So Messer Ricciardo, as soon as he\r\ndeemed the time ripe, as best and most delicately he was able, disclosed to\r\nPaganino the business on which he had come, praying him to take whatever in\r\nthe way of ransom he chose and restore him the lady. Paganino replied\r\ncheerily:--\"Right glad I am to see you here, Sir; and briefly thus I answer\r\nyou:--True it is that I have here a young woman; whether she be your wife or\r\nanother man's, I know not, for you are none of my acquaintance, nor is she,\r\nexcept for the short time that she has been with me. If, as you say, you are\r\nher husband, why, as you seem to me to be a pleasant gentleman, I will even\r\ntake you to her, and I doubt not she will know you well; if she says that it\r\nis even as you say, and is minded to go with you, you shall give me just\r\nwhat you like by way of ransom, so pleasant have I found you; otherwise\r\n'twill be churlish in you to think of taking her from me, who am a young\r\nman, and as fit to keep a woman as another, and moreover never knew any\r\nwoman so agreeable.\" \"My wife,\" said Ricciardo, \"she is beyond all manner of\r\ndoubt, as thou shalt see; for so soon as thou bringest me to her, she will\r\nthrow her arms about my neck; wherefore as thou art minded, even so be it; I\r\nask no more.\" \"Go we then,\" said Paganino; and forthwith they went into the\r\nhouse, and Paganino sent for the lady while they waited in one of the halls.\r\nBy and by she entered from one of the adjoining rooms all trim and tricked\r\nout, and advanced to the place where Paganino and Messer Ricciardo were\r\nstanding, but never a word did she vouchsafe to her husband, any more than\r\nif he had been some stranger whom Paganino had brought into the house.\r\nWhereat the judge was mightily amazed, having expected to be greeted by her\r\nwith the heartiest of cheer, and began to ruminate thus:--Perhaps I am so\r\nchanged by the melancholy and prolonged heartache, to which I have been a\r\nprey since I lost her, that she does not recognise me. Wherefore he said:--\r\n\"Madam, cause enough have I to rue it that I took thee a fishing, for never\r\nyet was known such grief as has been mine since I lost thee; and now it\r\nseems as if thou dost not recognise me, so scant of courtesy is thy\r\ngreeting. Seest thou not that I am thy Messer Ricciardo, come hither\r\nprepared to pay whatever this gentleman, in whose house we are, may demand,\r\nthat I may have thee back and take thee away with me: and he is so good as\r\nto surrender thee on my own terms?\" The lady turned to him with a slight\r\nsmile, and said:--\"Is it to me you speak, Sir? Bethink you that you may have\r\nmistaken me for another, for I, for my part, do not remember ever to have\r\nseen you.\" \"Nay,\" said Messer Ricciardo, \"but bethink thee what thou sayst;\r\nscan me closely; and if thou wilt but search thy memory, thou wilt find that\r\nI am thy Ricciardo di Chinzica.\" \"Your pardon, Sir,\" answered the lady,\r\n\"'tis not, perhaps, as seemly for me, as you imagine, to gaze long upon you;\r\nbut I have gazed long enough to know that I never saw you before.\" Messer\r\nRicciardo supposed that she so spoke for fear of Paganino, in whose presence\r\nshe durst not acknowledge that she knew him: so, after a while, he craved as\r\na favour of Paganino that he might speak with her in a room alone. Which\r\nrequest Paganino granted, so only that he did not kiss her against her will.\r\nHe then bade the lady go with Messer Ricciardo into a room apart, and hear\r\nwhat he had to say, and give him such answer as she deemed meet. So the lady\r\nand Messer Ricciardo went together into a room alone, and sate down, and\r\nMesser Ricciardo began on this wise:--\"Ah! dear heart of me, sweet soul of\r\nme, hope of me, dost not recognise thy Ricciardo that loves thee better than\r\nhimself? how comes it thus to pass? am I then so changed? Ah! goodly eye of\r\nme, do but look on me a little.\" Whereat the lady burst into a laugh, and\r\ninterrupting him, said:--\"Rest assured that my memory is not so short but\r\nthat I know you for what you are, my husband, Messer Ricciardo di Chinzica;\r\nbut far enough you shewed yourself to be, while I was with you, from knowing\r\nme for what I was, young, lusty, lively; which, had you been the wise man\r\nyou would fain be reputed, you would not have ignored, nor by consequence\r\nthat which, besides food and clothing, it behoves men to give young ladies,\r\nalbeit for shame they demand it not; which in what sort you gave, you know.\r\nYou should not have taken a wife if she was to be less to you than the study\r\nof the law, albeit 'twas never as a judge that I regarded you, but rather as\r\na bellman of encaenia and saints' days, so well you knew them all, and fasts\r\nand vigils. And I tell you that, had you imposed the observance of as many\r\nsaints' days on the labourers that till your lands as on yourself who had\r\nbut my little plot to till, you would never have harvested a single grain of\r\ncorn. God in His mercy, having regard unto my youth, has caused me to fall\r\nin with this gentleman, with whom I am much closeted in this room, where\r\nnought is known of feasts, such feasts, I mean, as you, more devoted to the\r\nservice of God than to the service of ladies, were wont to observe in such\r\nprofusion; nor was this threshold ever crossed by Saturday or Friday or\r\nvigil or Ember-days or Lent, that is so long; rather here we are at work day\r\nand night, threshing the wool, and well I know how featly it went when the\r\nmatin bell last sounded. Wherefore with him I mean to stay, and to work\r\nwhile I am young, and postpone the observance of feasts and times of\r\nindulgence and fasts until I am old: so get you hence, and good luck go with\r\nyou, but depart with what speed you may, and observe as many feasts as you\r\nlike, so I be not with you.\"\r\n\r\nThe pain with which Messer Ricciardo followed this outburst was more than he\r\ncould bear, and when she had done, he exclaimed:--\"Ah! sweet soul of me,\r\nwhat words are these that thou utterest? Hast thou no care for thy parents'\r\nhonour and thine own? Wilt thou remain here to be this man's harlot, and to\r\nlive in mortal sin, rather than live with me at Pisa as my wife? Why, when\r\nhe is tired of thee, he will cast thee out to thy most grievous dishonour. I\r\nwill ever cherish thee, and ever, will I nill I, thou wilt be the mistress\r\nof my house. Wouldst thou, to gratify this unbridled and unseemly passion,\r\npart at once with thy honour and with me, who love thee more dearly than my\r\nvery life? Ah! cherished hope of me, say not so again: make up thy mind to\r\ncome with me. As I now know thy bent, I will henceforth constrain myself to\r\npleasure thee: wherefore, sweet my treasure, think better of it, and come\r\nwith me, who have never known a happy hour since thou wert reft from me.\"\r\nThe lady answered:--\"I expect not, nor is it possible, that another should\r\nbe more tender of my honour than I am myself. Were my parents so, when they\r\ngave me to you? I trow not; nor mean I to be more tender of their honour now\r\nthan they were then of mine. And if now I live in mortar sin, I will ever\r\nabide there until it be pestle sin:(3) concern yourself no further on my\r\naccount. Moreover, let me tell you, that, whereas at Pisa 'twas as if I were\r\nyour harlot, seeing that the planets in conjunction according to lunar\r\nmansion and geometric square intervened between you and me, here with\r\nPaganino I deem myself a wife, for he holds me in his arms all night long\r\nand hugs and bites me, and how he serves me, God be my witness. Ah! but you\r\nsay you will constrain yourself to serve me: to what end? to do it on the\r\nthird essay, and raise it by stroke of baton? I doubt not you are become a\r\nperfect knight since last I saw you. Begone, and constrain yourself to live;\r\nfor here, methinks, your tenure is but precarious, so hectic and wasted is\r\nyour appearance. Nay more; I tell you this, that, should Paganino desert me\r\n(which he does not seem disposed to do so long as I am willing to stay with\r\nhim), never will I return to your house, where for one while I staid to my\r\nmost grievous loss and prejudice, but will seek my commodity elsewhere, than\r\nwith one from whose whole body I could not wring a single cupful of sap. So,\r\nagain, I tell you that here is neither feast nor vigil; wherefore here I\r\nmean to abide; and you, get you gone, in God's name with what speed you may,\r\nlest I raise the cry that you threaten to violate me.\"\r\n\r\nMesser Ricciardo felt himself hard bested, but he could not but recognise\r\nthat, worn out as he was, he had been foolish to take a young wife; so sad\r\nand woebegone he quitted the room, and, after expending on Paganino a wealth\r\nof words which signified nothing, he at last gave up his bootless\r\nenterprise, and leaving the lady to her own devices, returned to Pisa; where\r\nfor very grief he lapsed into such utter imbecility that, when he was met by\r\nany with greeting or question in the street, he made no other answer than\r\n\"the evil hole brooks no holiday,\" and soon afterwards died. Which when\r\nPaganino learned, being well assured of the love the lady bore him, he made\r\nher his lawful wife; and so, keeping neither feast nor vigil nor Lent, they\r\nworked as hard as their legs permitted, and had a good time. Wherefore, dear\r\nmy ladies, I am of opinion that Messer Bernabo in his altercation with\r\nAmbrogiuolo rode the goat downhill.(4)\r\n\r\n(1) A strong white wine.\r\n(2) The saying went, that owing to the multitude of churches at Ravenna\r\nevery day was there a saint's day.\r\n(3) A poor jeu de mots, mortaio, mortar, being substituted for mortale.\r\n(4) I.e. argued preposterously, the goat being the last animal to carry a\r\nrider comfortably downhill.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis story provoked so much laughter that the jaws of every one in the\r\ncompany ached; and all the ladies by common consent acknowledged that Dioneo\r\nwas right, and pronounced Bernabo a blockhead. But when the story was ended\r\nand the laughter had subsided, the queen, observing that the hour was now\r\nlate, and that with the completion of the day's story-telling the end of her\r\nsovereignty was come, followed the example of her predecessor, and took off\r\nher wreath and set it on Neifile's brow, saying with gladsome mien, \"Now,\r\ndear gossip, thine be the sovereignty of this little people;\" and so she\r\nresumed her seat. Neifile coloured somewhat to receive such honour, shewing\r\nof aspect even as the fresh-blown rose of April or May in the radiance of\r\nthe dawn, her eyes rather downcast, and glowing with love's fire like the\r\nmorning-star. But when the respectful murmur, by which the rest of the\r\ncompany gave blithe token of the favour in which they held their queen, was\r\nhushed, and her courage revived, she raised herself somewhat more in her\r\nseat than she was wont, and thus spoke:--\"As so it is that I am your queen,\r\nI purpose not to depart from the usage observed by my predecessors, whose\r\nrule has commanded not only your obedience but your approbation. I will\r\ntherefore in few words explain to you the course which, if it commend itself\r\nto your wisdom, we will follow. To-morrow, you know, is Friday, and the next\r\nday Saturday, days which most folk find somewhat wearisome by reason of the\r\nviands which are then customary, to say nothing of the reverence in which\r\nFriday is meet to be held, seeing that 'twas on that day that He who died\r\nfor us bore His passion; wherefore 'twould be in my judgment both right and\r\nvery seemly, if, in honour of God, we then bade story-telling give place to\r\nprayer. On Saturday ladies are wont to wash the head, and rid their persons\r\nof whatever of dust or other soilure they may have gathered by the labours\r\nof the past week; not a few, likewise, are wont to practise abstinence for\r\ndevotion to the Virgin Mother of the Son of God, and to honour the\r\napproaching Sunday by an entire surcease from work. Wherefore, as we cannot\r\nthen completely carry out our plan of life, we shall, I think, do well to\r\nintermit our story-telling on that day also. We shall then have been here\r\nfour days; and lest we should be surprised by new-comers, I deem it\r\nexpedient that we shift our quarters, and I have already taken thought for\r\nour next place of sojourn. Where, being arrived on Sunday, we will assemble\r\nafter our sleep; and, whereas to-day our discourse has had an ample field to\r\nrange in, I propose, both because you will thereby have more time for\r\nthought, and it will be best to set some limits to the license of our\r\nstory-telling, that of the many diversities of Fortune's handiwork we make\r\none our theme, whereof I have also made choice, to wit, the luck of such as\r\nhave painfully acquired some much-coveted thing, or having lost, have\r\nrecovered it. Whereon let each meditate some matter, which to tell may be\r\nprofitable or at least delectable to the company, saving always Dioneo's\r\nprivilege.\" All applauded the queen's speech and plan, to which, therefore,\r\nit was decided to give effect. Thereupon the queen called her seneschal,\r\ntold him where to place the tables that evening, and then explained to him\r\nall that he had to do during the time of her sovereignty. This done, she\r\nrose with her train, and gave leave to all to take their pleasure as to each\r\nmight seem best. So the ladies and the men hied them away to a little\r\ngarden, where they diverted themselves a while; then supper-time being come,\r\nthey supped with all gay and festal cheer. When they were risen from the\r\ntable, Emilia, at the queen's command, led the dance, while Pampinea, the\r\nother ladies responding, sang the ensuing song.\r\n\r\nShall any lady sing, if I not sing,\r\nI to whom Love did full contentment bring?\r\n\r\nCome hither, Love, thou cause of all my joy,\r\nOf all my hope, and all its sequel blest,\r\nAnd with me tune the lay,\r\nNo more to sighs and bitter past annoy,\r\nThat now but serve to lend thy bliss more zest;\r\nBut to that fire's clear ray,\r\nWherewith enwrapt I blithely live and gay,\r\nThee as my God for ever worshipping.\r\n\r\n'Twas thou, O Love, didst set before mine eyes,\r\nWhen first thy fire my soul did penetrate,\r\nA youth to be my fere,\r\nSo fair, so fit for deeds of high emprise,\r\nThat ne'er another shall be found more great,\r\nNay, nor, I ween, his peer:\r\nSuch flame he kindled that my heart's full cheer\r\nI now pour out in chant with thee, my King.\r\n\r\nAnd that wherein I most delight is this,\r\nThat as I love him, so he loveth me:\r\nSo thank thee, Love, I must.\r\nFor whatsoe'er this world can yield of bliss\r\nIs mine, and in the next at peace to be\r\nI hope through that full trust\r\nI place in him. And thou, O God, that dost\r\nIt see, wilt grant of joy thy plenishing.\r\n\r\nSome other songs and dances followed, to the accompaniment of divers sorts\r\nof music; after which, the queen deeming it time to go to rest, all,\r\nfollowing in the wake of the torches, sought their several chambers. The\r\nnext two days they devoted to the duties to which the queen had adverted,\r\nlooking forward to the Sunday with eager expectancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nEndeth here the second day of the Decameron, beginneth the third, in which,\r\nunder the rule of Neifile, discourse is had of the fortune of such as have\r\npainfully acquired some much-coveted thing, or, having lost, have recovered\r\nit.\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe dawn of Sunday was already changing from vermilion to orange, as the sun\r\nhasted to the horizon, when the queen rose and roused all the company. The\r\nseneschal had early sent forward to their next place of sojourn ample store\r\nof things meet with folk to make all things ready, and now seeing the queen\r\non the road, and the decampment, as it were, begun, he hastily completed the\r\nequipment of the baggage-train, and set off therewith, attended by the rest\r\nof the servants, in rear of the ladies and gentlemen. So, to the chant of,\r\nperhaps, a score of nightingales and other birds, the queen, her ladies and\r\nthe three young men trooping beside or after her, paced leisurely westward\r\nby a path little frequented and overgrown with herbage and flowers, which,\r\nas they caught the sunlight, began one and all to unfold their petals. So\r\nfared she on with her train, while the quirk and the jest and the laugh\r\npassed from mouth to mouth; nor had they completed more than two thousand\r\npaces when, well before half tierce,(1) they arrived at a palace most fair\r\nand sumptuous, which stood out somewhat from the plain, being situate upon a\r\nlow eminence. On entering, they first traversed its great halls and dainty\r\nchambers furnished throughout with all brave and meet appointments; and\r\nfinding all most commendable, they reputed its lord a magnifico. Then\r\ndescending, they surveyed its spacious and cheerful court, its vaults of\r\nexcellent wines and copious springs of most cool water, and found it still\r\nmore commendable. After which, being fain of rest, they sat them down in a\r\ngallery which commanded the court, and was close imbosked with leafage and\r\nsuch flowers as the season afforded, and thither the discreet seneschal\r\nbrought comfits and wines most choice and excellent, wherewith they were\r\nrefreshed. Whereupon they hied them to a walled garden adjoining the palace;\r\nwhich, the gate being opened, they entered, and wonder-struck by the beauty\r\nof the whole passed on to examine more attentively the several parts. It was\r\nbordered and traversed in many parts by alleys, each very wide and straight\r\nas an arrow and roofed in with trellis of vines, which gave good promise of\r\nbearing clusters that year, and, being all in flower, dispersed such\r\nfragrance throughout the garden as blended with that exhaled by many another\r\nplant that grew therein made the garden seem redolent of all the spices that\r\never grew in the East. The sides of the alleys were all, as it were, walled\r\nin with roses white and red and jasmine; insomuch that there was no part of\r\nthe garden but one might walk there not merely in the morning but at high\r\nnoon in grateful shade and fragrance, completely screened from the sun. As\r\nfor the plants that were in the garden, 'twere long to enumerate them, to\r\nspecify their sorts, to describe the order of their arrangement; enough, in\r\nbrief, that there was abundance of every rarer species that our climate\r\nallows. In the middle of the garden, a thing not less but much more to be\r\ncommended than aught else, was a lawn of the finest turf, and so green that\r\nit seemed almost black, pranked with flowers of, perhaps, a thousand sorts,\r\nand girt about with the richest living verdure of orange-trees and cedars,\r\nwhich shewed not only flowers but fruits both new and old, and were no less\r\ngrateful to the smell by their fragrance than to the eye by their shade. In\r\nthe middle of the lawn was a basin of whitest marble, graven with marvellous\r\nart; in the centre whereof--whether the spring were natural or artificial I\r\nknow not--rose a column supporting a figure which sent forth a jet of water\r\nof such volume and to such an altitude that it fell, not without a delicious\r\nplash, into the basin in quantity amply sufficient to turn a mill-wheel. The\r\noverflow was carried away from the lawn by a hidden conduit, and then,\r\nreemerging, was distributed through tiny channels, very fair and cunningly\r\ncontrived, in such sort as to flow round the entire lawn, and by similar\r\nderivative channels to penetrate almost every part of the fair garden,\r\nuntil, re-uniting at a certain point, it issued thence, and, clear as\r\ncrystal, slid down towards the plain, turning by the way two mill-wheels\r\nwith extreme velocity to the no small profit of the lord. The aspect of this\r\ngarden, its fair order, the plants and the fountain and the rivulets that\r\nflowed from it, so charmed the ladies and the three young men that with one\r\naccord they affirmed that they knew not how it could receive any accession\r\nof beauty, or what other form could be given to Paradise, if it were to be\r\nplanted on earth. So, excellently well pleased, they roved about it,\r\nplucking sprays from the trees, and weaving them into the fairest of\r\ngarlands, while songsters of, perhaps, a score of different sorts warbled as\r\nif in mutual emulation, when suddenly a sight as fair and delightsome as\r\nnovel, which, engrossed by the other beauties of the place, they had\r\nhitherto overlooked, met their eyes. For the garden, they now saw, was\r\npeopled with a host of living creatures, fair and of, perhaps, a hundred\r\nsorts; and they pointed out to one another how here emerged a cony, or there\r\nscampered a hare, or couched a goat, or grazed a fawn, or many another\r\nharmless, all but domesticated, creature roved carelessly seeking his\r\npleasure at his own sweet will. All which served immensely to reinforce\r\ntheir already abundant delight. At length, however, they had enough of\r\nwandering about the garden and observing this thing and that: wherefore they\r\nrepaired to the beautiful fountain, around which were ranged the tables, and\r\nthere, after they had sung half-a-dozen songs and trod some measures, they\r\nsat them down, at the queen's command, to breakfast, which was served with\r\nall celerity and in fair and orderly manner, the viands being both good and\r\ndelicate; whereby their spirits rose, and up they got, and betook themselves\r\nagain to music and song and dance, and so sped the hours, until, as the heat\r\nincreased, the queen deemed it time that whoso was so minded should go to\r\nsleep. Some there were that did so; others were too charmed by the beauty of\r\nthe place to think of leaving it; but tarried there, and, while the rest\r\nslept, amused themselves with reading romances or playing at chess or dice.\r\nHowever, after none, there was a general levee; and, with faces laved and\r\nrefreshed with cold water, they gathered by the queen's command upon the\r\nlawn, and, having sat them down in their wonted order by the fountain,\r\nwaited for the story-telling to begin upon the theme assigned by the queen.\r\nWith this duty the queen first charged Filostrato, who began on this wise.\r\n\r\n(1) I.e. midway between prime and tierce, about 7:30 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL I.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMasetto da Lamporecchio feigns to be dumb, and obtains a gardener's place at\r\na convent of women, who with one accord make haste to lie with him.\r\n--\r\n\r\nFairest ladies, not a few there are both of men and of women, who are so\r\nfoolish as blindly to believe that, so soon as a young woman has been veiled\r\nin white and cowled in black, she ceases to be a woman, and is no more\r\nsubject to the cravings proper to her sex, than if, in assuming the garb and\r\nprofession of a nun, she had put on the nature of a stone: and if,\r\nperchance, they hear of aught that is counter to this their faith, they are\r\nno less vehement in their censure than if some most heinous and unnatural\r\ncrime had been committed; neither bethinking them of themselves, whom\r\nunrestricted liberty avails not to satisfy, nor making due allowance for the\r\nprepotent forces of idleness and solitude. And likewise not a few there are\r\nthat blindly believe that, what with the hoe and the spade and coarse fare\r\nand hardship, the carnal propensities are utterly eradicated from the\r\ntillers of the soil, and therewith all nimbleness of wit and understanding.\r\nBut how gross is the error of such as so suppose, I, on whom the queen has\r\nlaid her commands, am minded, without deviating from the theme prescribed by\r\nher, to make manifest to you by a little story.\r\n\r\nIn this very country-side of ours there was and yet is a convent of women of\r\ngreat repute for sanctity--name it I will not, lest I should in some measure\r\ndiminish its repute--the nuns being at the time of which I speak but nine in\r\nnumber, including the abbess, and all young women. Their very beautiful\r\ngarden was in charge of a foolish fellow, who, not being content with his\r\nwage, squared accounts with their steward and hied him back to Lamporecchio,\r\nwhence he came. Among others who welcomed him home was a young husbandman,\r\nMasetto by name, a stout and hardy fellow, and handsome for a contadino, who\r\nasked him where he had been so long. Nuto, as our good friend was called,\r\ntold him. Masetto then asked how he had been employed at the convent, and\r\nNuto answered:--\"I kept their large and beautiful garden in good trim, and,\r\nbesides, I sometimes went to the wood to fetch the faggots, I drew water,\r\nand did some other trifling services; but the ladies gave so little wage\r\nthat it scarce kept me in shoes. And moreover they are all young, and, I\r\nthink, they are one and all possessed of the devil, for 'tis impossible to\r\ndo anything to their mind; indeed, when I would be at work in the\r\nkitchen-garden, 'put this here,' would say one, 'put that here,' would say\r\nanother, and a third would snatch the hoe from my hand, and say, 'that is\r\nnot as it should be'; and so they would worry me until I would give up\r\nworking and go out of the garden; so that, what with this thing and that, I\r\nwas minded to stay there no more, and so I am come hither. The steward asked\r\nme before I left to send him any one whom on my return I might find fit for\r\nthe work, and I promised; but God bless his loins, I shall be at no pains to\r\nfind out and send him any one.\"\r\n\r\nAs Nuto thus ran on, Masetto was seized by such a desire to be with these\r\nnuns that he quite pined, as he gathered from what Nuto said that his desire\r\nmight be gratified. And as that could not be, if he said nothing to Nuto, he\r\nremarked:--\"Ah! 'twas well done of thee to come hither. A man to live with\r\nwomen! he might as well live with so many devils: six times out of seven\r\nthey know not themselves what they want.\" There the conversation ended; but\r\nMasetto began to cast about how he should proceed to get permission to live\r\nwith them. He knew that he was quite competent for the services of which\r\nNuto spoke, and had therefore no fear of failing on that score; but he\r\ndoubted he should not be received, because he was too young and\r\nwell-favoured. So, after much pondering, he fell into the following train of\r\nthought:--The place is a long way off, and no one there knows me; if I make\r\nbelieve that I am dumb, doubtless I shall be admitted. Whereupon he made his\r\nmind up, laid a hatchet across his shoulder, and saying not a word to any of\r\nhis destination, set forth, intending to present himself at the convent in\r\nthe character of a destitute man. Arrived there, he had no sooner entered\r\nthan he chanced to encounter the steward in the courtyard, and making signs\r\nto him as dumb folk do, he let him know that of his charity he craved\r\nsomething to eat, and that, if need were, he would split firewood. The\r\nsteward promptly gave him to eat, and then set before him some logs which\r\nNuto had not been able to split, all which Masetto, who was very strong,\r\nsplit in a very short time. The steward, having occasion to go to the wood,\r\ntook him with him, and there set him at work on the lopping; which done he\r\nplaced the ass in front of him, and by signs made him understand that he was\r\nto take the loppings back to the convent. This he did so well that the\r\nsteward kept him for some days to do one or two odd jobs. Whereby it so\r\nbefell that one day the abbess saw him, and asked the steward who he was.\r\n\"Madam,\" replied the steward, \"'tis a poor deaf mute that came here a day or\r\ntwo ago craving alms, so I have treated him kindly, and have let him make\r\nhimself useful in many ways. If he knew how to do the work of the\r\nkitchen-garden and would stay with us, I doubt not we should be well served;\r\nfor we have need of him, and he is strong, and would be able for whatever he\r\nmight turn his hand to; besides which you would have no cause to be\r\napprehensive lest he should be cracking his jokes with your young women.\"\r\n\"As I trust in God,\" said the abbess, \"thou sayst sooth; find out if he can\r\ndo the garden work, and if he can, do all thou canst to keep him with us;\r\ngive him a pair of shoes, an old hood, and speak him well, make much of him,\r\nand let him be well fed.\" All which the steward promised to do.\r\n\r\nMasetto, meanwhile, was close at hand, making as if he were sweeping the\r\ncourtyard, and heard all that passed between the abbess and the steward,\r\nwhereat he gleefully communed with himself on this wise:--Put me once within\r\nthere, and you will see that I will do the work of the kitchen-garden as it\r\nnever was done before. So the steward set him to work in the kitchen-garden,\r\nand finding that he knew his business excellently well, made signs to him to\r\nknow whether he would stay, and he made answer by signs that he was ready to\r\ndo whatever the steward wished. The steward then signified that he was\r\nengaged, told him to take charge of the kitchen-garden, and shewed him what\r\nhe had to do there. Then, having other matters to attend to, he went away,\r\nand left him there. Now, as Masetto worked there day by day, the nuns began\r\nto tease him, and make him their butt (as it commonly happens that folk\r\nserve the dumb) and used bad language to him, the worst they could think of,\r\nsupposing that he could not understand them, all which passed scarce heeded\r\nby the abbess, who perhaps deemed him as destitute of virility as of speech.\r\nNow it so befell that after a hard day's work he was taking a little rest,\r\nwhen two young nuns, who were walking in the garden, approached the spot\r\nwhere he lay, and stopped to look at him, while he pretended to be asleep.\r\nAnd so the bolder of the two said to the other:--\"If I thought thou wouldst\r\nkeep the secret, I would tell thee what I have sometimes meditated, and\r\nwhich thou perhaps mightest also find agreeable.\" The other replied:--\"Speak\r\nthy mind freely and be sure that I will never tell a soul.\" Whereupon the\r\nbold one began:--\"I know not if thou hast ever considered how close we are\r\nkept here, and that within these precincts dare never enter any man, unless\r\nit be the old steward or this mute: and I have often heard from ladies that\r\nhave come hither, that all the other sweets that the world has to offer\r\nsignify not a jot in comparison of the pleasure that a woman has in\r\nconnexion with a man. Whereof I have more than once been minded to make\r\nexperiment with this mute, no other man being available. Nor, indeed, could\r\none find any man in the whole world so meet therefor; seeing that he could\r\nnot blab if he would; thou seest that he is but a dull clownish lad, whose\r\nsize has increased out of all proportion to his sense; wherefore I would\r\nfain hear what thou hast to say to it.\" \"Alas!\" said the other, \"what is't\r\nthou sayst? Knowest thou not that we have vowed our virginity to God?\" \"Oh,\"\r\nrejoined the first, \"think but how many vows are made to Him all day long,\r\nand never a one performed: and so, for our vow, let Him find another or\r\nothers to perform it.\" \"But,\" said her companion, \"suppose that we\r\nconceived, how then?\" \"Nay but,\" protested the first, \"thou goest about to\r\nimagine evil before it befalls, thee: time enough to think of that when it\r\ncomes to pass; there will be a thousand ways to prevent its ever being\r\nknown, so only we do not publish it ourselves.\" Thus reassured, the other\r\nwas now the more eager of the two to test the quality of the male human\r\nanimal. \"Well then,\" she said, \"how shall we go about it?\" and was\r\nanswered:--\"Thou seest 'tis past none; I make no doubt but all the sisters\r\nare asleep, except ourselves; search we through the kitchen-garden, to see\r\nif there be any there, and if there be none, we have but to take him by the\r\nhand and lead him hither to the hut where he takes shelter from the rain;\r\nand then one shall mount guard while the other has him with her inside. He\r\nis such a simpleton that he will do just whatever we bid him.\" No word of\r\nthis conversation escaped Masetto, who, being disposed to obey, hoped for\r\nnothing so much as that one of them should take him by the hand. They,\r\nmeanwhile, looked carefully all about them, and satisfied themselves that\r\nthey were secure from observation: then she that had broached the subject\r\ncame close up to Masetto, and shook him; whereupon he started to his feet.\r\nSo she took him by the hand with a blandishing air, to which he replied with\r\nsome clownish grins. And then she led him into the hut, where he needed no\r\npressing to do what she desired of him. Which done, she changed places with\r\nthe other, as loyal comradeship required; and Masetto, still keeping up the\r\npretence of simplicity, did their pleasure. Wherefore before they left, each\r\nmust needs make another assay of the mute's powers of riding; and\r\nafterwards, talking the matter over many times, they agreed that it was in\r\ntruth not less but even more delightful than they had been given to\r\nunderstand; and so, as they found convenient opportunity, they continued to\r\ngo and disport themselves with the mute.\r\n\r\nNow it so chanced that one of their gossips, looking out of the window of\r\nher cell, saw what they did, and imparted it to two others. The three held\r\ncounsel together whether they should not denounce the offenders to the\r\nabbess, but soon changed their mind, and came to an understanding with them,\r\nwhereby they became partners in Masetto. And in course of time by divers\r\nchances the remaining three nuns also entered the partnership. Last of all\r\nthe abbess, still witting nought of these doings, happened one very hot day,\r\nas she walked by herself through the garden, to find Masetto, who now rode\r\nso much by night that he could stand very little fatigue by day, stretched\r\nat full length asleep under the shade of an almond-tree, his person quite\r\nexposed in front by reason that the wind had disarranged his clothes. Which\r\nthe lady observing, and knowing that she was alone, fell a prey to the same\r\nappetite to which her nuns had yielded: she aroused Masetto, and took him\r\nwith her to her chamber, where, for some days, though the nuns loudly\r\ncomplained that the gardener no longer came to work in the kitchen-garden,\r\nshe kept him, tasting and re-tasting the sweetness of that indulgence which\r\nshe was wont to be the first to censure in others. And when at last she had\r\nsent him back from her chamber to his room, she must needs send for him\r\nagain and again, and made such exorbitant demands upon him, that Masetto,\r\nnot being able to satisfy so many women, bethought him that his part of\r\nmute, should he persist in it, might entail disastrous consequences. So one\r\nnight, when he was with the abbess, he cut the tongue-string, and thus broke\r\nsilence:--\"Madam, I have understood that a cock may very well serve ten\r\nhens, but that ten men are sorely tasked to satisfy a single woman; and here\r\nam I expected to serve nine, a burden quite beyond my power to bear; nay, by\r\nwhat I have already undergone I am now so reduced that my strength is quite\r\nspent; wherefore either bid me Godspeed, or find some means to make matters\r\ntolerable.\" Wonder-struck to hear the supposed mute thus speak, the lady\r\nexclaimed:--\"What means this? I took thee to be dumb.\" \"And in sooth, Madam,\r\nso was I,\" said Masetto, \"not indeed from my birth, but through an illness\r\nwhich took from me the power of speech, which only this very night have I\r\nrecovered; and so I praise God with all my heart.\" The lady believed him;\r\nand asked him what he meant by saying that he had nine to serve. Masetto\r\ntold her how things stood; whereby she perceived that of all her nuns there\r\nwas not any but was much wiser than she; and lest, if Masetto were sent\r\naway, he should give the convent a bad name, she discreetly determined to\r\narrange matters with the nuns in such sort that he might remain there. So,\r\nthe steward having died within the last few days, she assembled all the\r\nnuns; and their and her own past errors being fully avowed, they by common\r\nconsent, and with Masetto's concurrence, resolved that the neighbours should\r\nbe given to understand that by their prayers and the merits of their patron\r\nsaint, Masetto, long mute, had recovered the power of speech; after which\r\nthey made him steward, and so ordered matters among themselves that he was\r\nable to endure the burden of their service. In the course of which, though\r\nhe procreated not a few little monastics, yet 'twas all managed so\r\ndiscreetly that no breath of scandal stirred, until after the abbess's\r\ndeath, by which time Masetto was advanced in years and minded to return home\r\nwith the wealth that he had gotten; which he was suffered to do, as soon as\r\nhe made his desire known. And so Masetto, who had left Lamporecchio with a\r\nhatchet on his shoulder, returned thither in his old age rich and a father,\r\nhaving by the wisdom with which he employed his youth, spared himself the\r\npains and expense of rearing children, and averring that such was the\r\nmeasure that Christ meted out to the man that set horns on his cap.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL II.\r\n\r\n--\r\nA groom lies with the wife of King Agilulf, who learns the fact, keeps his\r\nown counsel, finds out the groom and shears him.

Which behest\r\nPampinea smilingly obeyed, and thus began:--\r\n\r\nSome there are whose indiscretion is such that they must needs evince that\r\nthey are fully cognizant of that which it were best they should not know,\r\nand censuring the covert misdeeds of others, augment beyond measure the\r\ndisgrace which they would fain diminish. The truth whereof, fair ladies, I\r\nmean to shew you in the contrary case, wherein appears the astuteness of one\r\nthat held, perhaps, an even lower place than would have been Masetto's in\r\nthe esteem of a doughty king.\r\n\r\nAgilulf, King of the Lombards, who like his predecessors made the city of\r\nPavia in Lombardy the seat of his government, took to wife Theodelinde, the\r\nwidow of Authari, likewise King of the Lombards, a lady very fair, wise and\r\nvirtuous, but who was unfortunate in her lover. For while the Lombards\r\nprospered in peace under the wise and firm rule of King Agilulf, it so\r\nbefell that one of the Queen's grooms, a man born to very low estate, but in\r\nnative worth far above his mean office, and moreover not a whit less tall\r\nand goodly of person than the King, became inordinately enamoured of her.\r\nAnd as, for all his base condition he had sense enough to recognize that his\r\nlove was in the last degree presumptuous, he disclosed it to none, nay, he\r\ndid not even venture to tell her the tale by the mute eloquence of his eyes.\r\nAnd albeit he lived without hope that he should ever be able to win her\r\nfavour, yet he inwardly gloried that he had fixed his affections in so high\r\na place; and being all aflame with passion, he shewed himself zealous beyond\r\nany of his comrades to do whatever he thought was likely to please the\r\nQueen. Whereby it came about, that, when the Queen had to take horse, she\r\nwould mount the palfrey that he groomed rather than any other; and when she\r\ndid so, he deemed himself most highly favoured, and never quitted her\r\nstirrup, esteeming himself happy if he might but touch her clothes. But as\r\n'tis frequently observed that love waxes as hope wanes, so was it with this\r\npoor groom, insomuch that the burden of this great hidden passion,\r\nalleviated by no hope, was most grievous to bear, and from time to time, not\r\nbeing able to shake it off, he purposed to die. And meditating on the mode,\r\nhe was minded that it should be of a kind to make it manifest that he died\r\nfor the love which he had borne and bore to the Queen, and also to afford\r\nhim an opportunity of trying his fortune whether his desire might in whole\r\nor in part be gratified. He had no thought of speaking to the Queen, nor yet\r\nof declaring his love to her by letter, for he knew that 'twould be vain\r\neither to speak or to write; but he resolved to try to devise some means\r\nwhereby he might lie with the Queen; which end might in no other way be\r\ncompassed than by contriving to get access to her in her bedroom; which\r\ncould only be by passing himself off as the King, who, as he knew, did not\r\nalways lie with her. Wherefore, that he might observe the carriage and dress\r\nof the King as he passed to her room, he contrived to conceal himself for\r\nseveral nights in a great hall of the King's palace which separated the\r\nKing's room from that of the Queen: and on one of these nights he saw the\r\nKing issue from his room, wrapped in a great mantle, with a lighted torch in\r\none hand and a wand in the other, and cross the hall, and, saying nothing,\r\ntap the door of the Queen's room with the wand once or twice; whereupon the\r\ndoor was at once opened and the torch taken from his hand. Having observed\r\nthe King thus go and return, and being bent on doing likewise, he found\r\nmeans to come by a mantle like that which he had seen the King wear, and\r\nalso a torch and a wand: he then took a warm bath, and having thoroughly\r\ncleansed himself, that the smell of the foul straw might not offend the\r\nlady, or discover to her the deceit, he in this guise concealed himself as\r\nhe was wont in the great hall. He waited only until all were asleep, and\r\nthen, deeming the time come to accomplish his purpose, or by his presumption\r\nclear a way to the death which he coveted, he struck a light with the flint\r\nand steel which he had brought with him; and having kindled his torch and\r\nwrapped himself close in his mantle, he went to the door of the Queen's\r\nroom, and tapped on it twice with his wand. The door was opened by a very\r\ndrowsy chambermaid, who took the torch and put it out of sight; whereupon\r\nwithout a word he passed within the curtain, laid aside the mantle, and got\r\ninto the bed where the Queen lay asleep. Then, taking her in his arms and\r\nstraining her to him with ardour, making as if he were moody, because he\r\nknew that, when the King was in such a frame, he would never hear aught, in\r\nsuch wise, without word said either on his part or on hers, he had more than\r\nonce carnal cognizance of the Queen. Loath indeed was he to leave her, but,\r\nfearing lest by too long tarrying his achieved delight might be converted\r\ninto woe, he rose, resumed the mantle and the light, and leaving the room\r\nwithout a word, returned with all speed to his bed. He was hardly there when\r\nthe King got up and entered the Queen's room; whereat she wondered not a\r\nlittle; but, reassured by the gladsome greeting which he gave her as he got\r\ninto bed, she said:--\"My lord, what a surprise is this to-night! 'Twas but\r\nnow you left me after an unwonted measure of enjoyment, and do you now\r\nreturn so soon? consider what you do.\" From these words the King at once\r\ninferred that the Queen had been deceived by some one that had counterfeited\r\nhis person and carriage; but, at the same time, bethinking himself that, as\r\nneither the Queen nor any other had detected the cheat, 'twas best to leave\r\nher in ignorance, he wisely kept silence. Which many a fool would not have\r\ndone, but would have said:--\"Nay, 'twas not I that was here. Who was it that\r\nwas here? How came it to pass? Who came hither?\" Whereby in the sequel he\r\nmight have caused the lady needless chagrin, and given her occasion to\r\ndesire another such experience as she had had, and so have brought disgrace\r\nupon himself by uttering that, from which, unuttered, no shame could have\r\nresulted. Wherefore, betraying little, either by his mien or by his words,\r\nof the disquietude which he felt, the King replied:--\"Madam, seem I such to\r\nyou that you cannot suppose that I should have been with you once, and\r\nreturned to you immediately afterwards?\" \"Nay, not so, my lord,\" returned\r\nthe lady, \"but none the less I pray you to look to your health.\" Then said\r\nthe King:--\"And I am minded to take your advice; wherefore, without giving\r\nyou further trouble I will leave you.\" So, angered and incensed beyond\r\nmeasure by the trick which, he saw, had been played upon him, he resumed his\r\nmantle and quitted the room with the intention of privily detecting the\r\noffender, deeming that he must belong to the palace, and that, whoever he\r\nmight be, he could not have quitted it. So, taking with him a small lantern\r\nwhich shewed only a glimmer of light, he went into the dormitory which was\r\nover the palace-stables and was of great length, insomuch that well-nigh all\r\nthe men-servants slept there in divers beds, and arguing that, by whomsoever\r\nthat of which the Queen spoke was done, his heart and pulse could not after\r\nsuch a strain as yet have ceased to throb, he began cautiously with one of\r\nthe head-grooms, and so went from bed to bed feeling at the heart of each\r\nman to see if it was thumping. All were asleep, save only he that had been\r\nwith the Queen, who, seeing the King come, and guessing what he sought to\r\ndiscover, began to be mightily afraid, insomuch that to the agitation which\r\nhis late exertion had communicated to his heart, terror now added one yet\r\nmore violent; nor did he doubt that, should the King perceive it, he would\r\nkill him. Divers alternatives of action thronged his mind; but at last,\r\nobserving that the King was unarmed, he resolved to make as if he were\r\nasleep, and wait to see what the King would do. So, having tried many and\r\nfound none that he deemed the culprit, the King came at last to the culprit\r\nhimself, and marking the thumping of his heart, said to himself:--This is\r\nhe. But being minded to afford no clue to his ulterior purpose, he did no\r\nmore than with a pair of scissors which he had brought with him shear away\r\non one side of the man's head a portion of his locks, which, as was then the\r\nfashion, he wore very long, that by this token he might recognize him on the\r\nmorrow; and having so done, he departed and returned to his room. The groom,\r\nwho was fully sensible of what the King had done, and being a shrewd fellow\r\nunderstood very well to what end he was so marked, got up without a moment's\r\ndelay; and, having found a pair of scissors--for, as it chanced, there were\r\nseveral pairs there belonging to the stables for use in grooming the horse--\r\nhe went quietly through the dormitory and in like manner sheared the locks\r\nof each of the sleepers just above the ear; which done without disturbing\r\nany, he went back to bed.\r\n\r\n On the morrow, as soon as the King was risen, and before the gates of the\r\npalace were opened, he summoned all his men-servants to his presence, and,\r\nas they stood bareheaded before him, scanned them closely to see whether the\r\none whom he had sheared was there; and observing with surprise that the more\r\npart of them were all sheared in the same manner, said to himself:--Of a\r\nsurety this fellow, whom I go about to detect, evinces, for all his base\r\ncondition, a high degree of sense. Then, recognising that he could not\r\ncompass his end without causing a bruit, and not being minded to brave so\r\ngreat a dishonour in order to be avenged upon so petty an offender, he was\r\ncontent by a single word of admonition to shew him that his offence had not\r\nescaped notice. Wherefore turning to them all, he said:--\"He that did it,\r\nlet him do it no more, and get you hence in God's peace.\" Another would have\r\nput them to the strappado, the question, the torture, and thereby have\r\nbrought to light that which one should rather be sedulous to cloak; and\r\nhaving so brought it to light, would, however complete the retribution which\r\nhe exacted, have not lessened but vastly augmented his disgrace, and sullied\r\nthe fair fame of his lady. Those who heard the King's parting admonition\r\nwondered, and made much question with one another, what the King might have\r\nmeant to convey by it; but 'twas understood by none but him to whom it\r\nreferred: who was discreet enough never to reveal the secret as long as the\r\nKing lived, or again to stake his life on such a venture.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL III.\r\n\r\n--\r\nUnder cloak of confession and a most spotless conscience, a lady, enamoured\r\nof a young man, induces a booby friar unwittingly to provide a means to the\r\nentire gratification of her passion.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen Pampinea had done, and several of the company had commended the\r\nhardihood and wariness of the groom, as also the wisdom of the King, the\r\nqueen, turning to Filomena, bade her follow suit: wherefore with manner\r\ndebonair Filomena thus began:--\r\n\r\nThe story which I shall tell you is of a trick which was actually played by\r\na fair lady upon a booby religious, and which every layman should find the\r\nmore diverting that these religious, being, for the most part, great\r\nblockheads and men of odd manners and habits, do nevertheless credit\r\nthemselves with more ability and knowledge in all kinds than fall to the lot\r\nof the rest of the world; whereas, in truth, they are far inferior, and so,\r\nnot being able, like others, to provide their own sustenance, are prompted\r\nby sheer baseness to fly thither for refuge where they may find provender,\r\nlike pigs. Which story, sweet my ladies, I shall tell you, not merely that\r\nthereby I may continue the sequence in obedience to the queen's behest, but\r\nalso to the end that I may let you see that even the religious, in whom we\r\nin our boundless credulity repose exorbitant faith, may be, and sometimes\r\nare, made--not to say by men--even by some of us women the sport of their\r\nsly wit.\r\n\r\nIn our city, where wiles do more abound than either love or faith, there\r\ndwelt, not many years ago, a gentlewoman richly endowed (none more so) by\r\nnature with physical charms, as also with gracious manners, high spirit and\r\nfine discernment. Her name I know, but will not disclose it, nor yet that of\r\nany other who figures in this story, because there yet live those who might\r\ntake offence thereat, though after all it might well be passed off with a\r\nlaugh. High-born and married to an artificer of woollen fabrics, she could\r\nnot rid her mind of the disdain with which, by reason of his occupation, she\r\nregarded her husband; for no man, however wealthy, so he were of low\r\ncondition, seemed to her worthy to have a gentlewoman to wife; and seeing\r\nthat for all his wealth he was fit for nothing better than to devise a\r\nblend, set up a warp, or higgle about yarn with a spinster, she determined\r\nto dispense with his embraces, save so far as she might find it impossible\r\nto refuse them; and to find her satisfaction elsewhere with one that seemed\r\nto her more meet to afford it than her artificer of woollens. In this frame\r\nof mind she became enamoured of a man well worthy of her love and not yet\r\npast middle age, insomuch that, if she saw him not in the day, she must\r\nneeds pass an unquiet night. The gallant, meanwhile, remained fancy-free,\r\nfor he knew nought of the lady's case; and she, being apprehensive of\r\npossible perils to ensue, was far too circumspect to make it known to him\r\neither by writing or by word of mouth of any of her female friends. Then she\r\nlearned that he had much to do with a religious, a simple, clownish fellow,\r\nbut nevertheless, as being a man of most holy life, reputed by almost\r\neverybody a most worthy friar, and decided that she could not find a better\r\nintermediary between herself and her lover than this same friar. So, having\r\nmatured her plan, she hied her at a convenient time to the convent where the\r\nfriar abode and sent for him, saying, that, if he so pleased, she would be\r\nconfessed by him. The friar, who saw at a glance that she was a gentlewoman,\r\ngladly heard her confession; which done, she said:--\"My father, I have yet a\r\nmatter to confide to you, in which I must crave your aid and counsel. Who my\r\nkinsfolk and husband are, I wot you know, for I have myself told you. My\r\nhusband loves me more dearly than his life, and being very wealthy, he can\r\nwell and does forthwith afford me whatever I desire. Wherefore, as he loves\r\nme, even so I love him more dearly than myself; nor was there ever yet\r\nwicked woman that deserved the fire so richly as should I, were I guilty--I\r\nspeak not of acts, but of so much as a single thought of crossing his will\r\nor tarnishing his honour. Now a man there is--his name, indeed, I know not,\r\nbut he seems to me to be a gentleman, and, if I mistake not, he is much with\r\nyou--a fine man and tall, his garb dun and very decent, who, the bent of my\r\nmind being, belike, quite unknown to him, would seem to have laid siege to\r\nme, insomuch that I cannot shew myself at door or casement, or quit the\r\nhouse, but forthwith he presents himself before me; indeed I find it passing\r\nstrange that he is not here now; whereat I am sorely troubled, because, when\r\nmen so act, unmerited reproach will often thereby be cast upon honest women.\r\nAt times I have been minded to inform my brothers of the matter; but then I\r\nhave bethought me that men sometimes frame messages in such a way as to\r\nevoke untoward answers, whence follow high words; and so they proceed to\r\nrash acts: wherefore, to obviate trouble and scandal, I have kept silence,\r\nand by preference have made you my confidant, both because you are the\r\ngentleman's friend, and because it befits your office to censure such\r\nbehaviour not only in friends but in strangers. And so I beseech you for the\r\nlove of our only Lord God to make him sensible of his fault, and pray him to\r\noffend no more in such sort. Other ladies there are in plenty, who may,\r\nperchance, be disposed to welcome such advances, and be flattered to attract\r\nhis fond and assiduous regard, which to me, who am in no wise inclined to\r\nencourage it, is but a most grievous molestation.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken, the lady bowed her head as if she were ready to weep.\r\nThe holy friar was at no loss to apprehend who it was of whom she spoke; he\r\ncommended her virtuous frame, firmly believing that what she said was true,\r\nand promised to take such action that she should not again suffer the like\r\nannoyance; nor, knowing that she was very wealthy, did he omit to extol\r\nworks of charity and almsgiving, at the same time opening to her his own\r\nneeds. \"I make my suit to you,\" said she, \"for the love of God; and if your\r\nfriend should deny what I have told you, tell him roundly that 'twas from me\r\nyou had it, and that I made complaint to you thereof.\" So, her confession\r\nended and penance imposed, bethinking her of the hints which the friar had\r\ndropped touching almsgiving, she slipped into his hand as many coins as it\r\nwould hold, praying him to say masses for the souls of her dead. She then\r\nrose and went home.\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards the gallant paid one of his wonted visits to the holy\r\nfriar. They conversed for a while of divers topics, and then the friar took\r\nhim aside, and very courteously reproved him for so haunting and pursuing\r\nthe lady with his gaze, as from what she had given him to understand, he\r\nsupposed was his wont. The gallant, who had never regarded her with any\r\nattention, and very rarely passed her house, was amazed, and was about to\r\nclear himself, when the friar closed his mouth, saying:--\"Now away with this\r\npretence of amazement, and waste not words in denial, for 'twill not avail\r\nthee. I have it not from the neighbours; she herself, bitterly complaining\r\nof thy conduct, told it me. I say not how ill this levity beseems thee; but\r\nof her I tell thee so much as this, that, if I ever knew woman averse to\r\nsuch idle philandering, she is so; and therefore for thy honour's sake, and\r\nthat she be no more vexed, I pray thee refrain therefrom, and let her be in\r\npeace.\" The gallant, having rather more insight than the holy friar, was not\r\nslow to penetrate the lady's finesse; he therefore made as if he were rather\r\nshame-stricken, promised to go no further with the matter, and hied him\r\nstraight from the friar to the lady's house, where she was always posted at\r\na little casement to see if he were passing by. As she saw him come, she\r\nshewed him so gay and gracious a mien that he could no longer harbour any\r\ndoubt that he had put the true construction upon what he had heard from the\r\nfriar; and thenceforth, to his own satisfaction and the immense delight and\r\nsolace of the lady, he omitted not daily to pass that way, being careful to\r\nmake it appear as if he came upon other business. 'Twas thus not long before\r\nthe lady understood that she met with no less favour in his eyes than he in\r\nhers; and being desirous to add fuel to his flame, and to assure him of the\r\nlove she bore him, as soon as time and occasion served, she returned to the\r\nholy friar, and having sat herself down at his feet in the church, fell a\r\nweeping. The friar asked her in a soothing tone what her new trouble might\r\nbe. Whereto the lady answered:--\"My father, 'tis still that accursed friend\r\nof thine, of whom I made complaint to you some days ago, and who would now\r\nseem to have been born for my most grievous torment, and to cause me to do\r\nthat by reason whereof I shall never be glad again, nor venture to place\r\nmyself at your feet.\" \"How?\" said the friar; \"has he not forborne to annoy\r\nthee?\" \"Not he, indeed,\" said the lady; \"on the contrary, 'tis my belief\r\nthat, since I complained to you of him, he has, as if in despite, being\r\noffended, belike, that I did so, passed my house seven times for once that\r\nhe did so before. Nay, would to God he were content to pass and fix me with\r\nhis eyes; but he is waxed so bold and unabashed that only yesterday he sent\r\na woman to me at home with his compliments and cajoleries, and, as if I had\r\nnot purses and girdles enough, he sent me a purse and a girdle; whereat I\r\nwas, as I still am, so wroth, that, had not conscience first, and then\r\nregard for you, weighed with me, I had flown into a frenzy of rage. However,\r\nI restrained myself, and resolved neither to do nor to say aught without\r\nfirst letting you know it. Nor only so; but, lest the woman who brought the\r\npurse and girdle, and to whom I at first returned them, shortly bidding her\r\nbegone and take them back to the sender, should keep them and tell him that\r\nI had accepted them, as I believe they sometimes do, I recalled her and had\r\nthem back, albeit 'twas in no friendly spirit that I received them from her\r\nhand; and I have brought them to you, that you may return them to him and\r\ntell him that I stand in no need of such gifts from him, because, thanks be\r\nto God and my husband, I have purses and girdles enough to smother him in.\r\nAnd if after this he leave me not alone, I pray you as my father to hold me\r\nexcused if, come what may, I tell it to my husband and brothers; for much\r\nliefer had I that he suffer indignity, if so it must be, than that my fair\r\nfame should be sullied on his account: that holds good, friar.\" Weeping\r\nbitterly as she thus ended, she drew from under her robe a purse of very\r\nfine and ornate workmanship and a dainty and costly little girdle, and threw\r\nthem into the lap of the friar, who, fully believing what she said,\r\nmanifested the utmost indignation as he took them, and said:--\"Daughter,\r\nthat by these advances thou shouldst be moved to anger, I deem neither\r\nstrange nor censurable; but I am instant with thee to follow my advice in\r\nthe matter. I chid him some days ago, and ill has he kept the promise that\r\nhe made me; for which cause and this last feat of his I will surely make his\r\nears so tingle that he will give thee no more trouble; wherefore, for God's\r\nsake, let not thyself be so overcome by wrath as to tell it to any of thy\r\nkinsfolk; which might bring upon him a retribution greater than he deserves.\r\nNor fear lest thereby thy fair fame should suffer; for I shall ever be thy\r\nmost sure witness before God and men that thou art innocent.\" The lady made\r\na shew of being somewhat comforted: then, after a pause--for well she knew\r\nthe greed of him and his likes--she said:--\"Of late, Sir, by night, the\r\nspirits of divers of my kinsfolk have appeared to me in my sleep, and\r\nmethinks they are in most grievous torment; alms, alms, they crave, nought\r\nelse, especially my mother, who seems to be in so woful and abject a plight\r\nthat 'tis pitiful to see. Methinks 'tis a most grievous torment to her to\r\nsee the tribulation which this enemy of God has brought upon me. I would\r\ntherefore have you say for their souls the forty masses of St. Gregory and\r\nsome of your prayers, that God may deliver them from this purging fire.\" So\r\nsaying she slipped a florin into the hand of the holy friar, who took it\r\ngleefully, and having with edifying words and many examples fortified her in\r\nher devotion, gave her his benediction, and suffered her to depart.\r\n\r\nThe lady gone, the friar, who had still no idea of the trick that had been\r\nplayed upon him, sent for his friend; who was no sooner come than he\r\ngathered from the friar's troubled air that he had news of the lady, and\r\nwaited to hear what he would say. The friar repeated what he had said\r\nbefore, and then broke out into violent and heated objurgation on the score\r\nof the lady's latest imputation. The gallant, who did not as yet apprehend\r\nthe friar's drift, gave but a very faint denial to the charge of sending the\r\npurse and girdle, in order that he might not discredit the lady with the\r\nfriar, if, perchance, she had given him the purse and girdle. Whereupon the\r\nfriar exclaimed with great heat:--\"How canst thou deny it, thou wicked man?\r\nWhy, here they are; she brought them to me in tears with her own hand. Look\r\nat them, and say if thou knowest them not.\" The gallant now feigned to be\r\nmuch ashamed, and said:--\"Why, yes, indeed, I do know them; I confess that I\r\ndid wrong; and I swear to you that, now I know her character, you shall\r\nnever hear word more of this matter.\" Many words followed; and then the\r\nblockheadly friar gave the purse and girdle to his friend, after which he\r\nread him a long lecture, besought him to meddle no more with such matters,\r\nand on his promising obedience dismissed him.\r\n\r\nElated beyond measure by the assurance which he now had of the lady's love,\r\nand the beautiful present, the gallant, on leaving the friar, hied him\r\nstraight to a spot whence he stealthily gave the lady to see that he had\r\nboth her gifts: whereat the lady was well content, the more so as her\r\nintrigue seemed ever to prosper more and more. She waited now only for her\r\nhusband's departure from home to crown her enterprise with success. Nor was\r\nit long before occasion required that her husband should go to Genoa. The\r\nvery morning that he took horse and rode away she hied her to the holy\r\nfriar, and after many a lamentation she said to him betwixt her sobs:--\"My\r\nfather, now at last I tell you out and out that I can bear my suffering no\r\nlonger. I promised you some days ago to do nought in this matter without\r\nfirst letting you know it; I am now come to crave release from that promise;\r\nand that you may believe that my lamentations and complaints are not\r\ngroundless, I will tell you how this friend of yours, who should rather be\r\ncalled a devil let loose from hell, treated me only this very morning, a\r\nlittle before matins. As ill-luck would have it, he learned, I know not how,\r\nthat yesterday morning my husband went to Genoa, and so this morning at the\r\nsaid hour he came into my garden, and got up by a tree to the window of my\r\nbedroom, which looks out over the garden, and had already opened the\r\ncasement, and was about to enter the room, when I suddenly awoke, and got up\r\nand uttered a cry, and should have continued to cry out, had not he, who was\r\nstill outside, implored my mercy for God's sake and yours, telling me who he\r\nwas. So, for love of you I was silent, and naked as I was born, ran and shut\r\nthe window in his face, and he--bad luck to him--made off, I suppose, for I\r\nsaw him no more. Consider now if such behaviour be seemly and tolerable: I\r\nfor my part am minded to put up with no more of it; indeed I have endured\r\ntoo much already for love of you.\"\r\n\r\nWroth beyond measure was the friar, as he heard her thus speak, nor knew he\r\nwhat to say, except that he several times asked her if she were quite\r\ncertain that it was no other than he. \"Holy name of God!\" replied the lady,\r\n\"as if I did not yet know him from another! He it was, I tell you; and do\r\nyou give no credence to his denial.\" \"Daughter,\" said then the friar, \"there\r\nis here nought else to say but that this is a monstrous presumption and a\r\nmost heinous offence; and thou didst well to send him away as thou didst.\r\nBut seeing that God has preserved thee from shame, I would implore thee that\r\nas thou hast twice followed my advice, thou do so likewise on this occasion,\r\nand making no complaint to any of thy kinsfolk, leave it to me to try if I\r\ncan control this devil that has slipt his chain, whom I supposed to be a\r\nsaint; and if I succeed in weaning him from this insensate folly, well and\r\ngood; and if I fail, thenceforth I give thee leave, with my blessing, to do\r\nwhatsoever may commend itself to thy own judgment.\" \"Lo now,\" answered the\r\nlady, \"once again I will not vex or disobey you; but be sure that you so\r\norder matters that he refrain from further annoyance, as I give you my word\r\nthat never will I have recourse to you again touching this matter.\" Then,\r\nwithout another word, and with a troubled air, she took leave of him.\r\nScarcely was she out of the church when the gallant came up. The friar\r\ncalled him, took him aside, and gave him the affront in such sort as 'twas\r\nnever before given to any man reviling him as a disloyal and perjured\r\ntraitor. The gallant, who by his two previous lessons had been taught how to\r\nvalue the friar's censures, listened attentively, and sought to draw him out\r\nby ambiguous answers. \"Wherefore this wrath, Sir?\" he began. \"Have I\r\ncrucified Christ?\" \"Ay, mark the fellow's effrontery!\" retorted the friar:\r\n\"list to what he says! He talks, forsooth, as if 'twere a year or so since,\r\nand his villanies and lewdnesses were clean gone from his memory for lapse\r\nof time. Between matins and now hast thou forgotten this morning's outrage?\r\nWhere wast thou this morning shortly before daybreak?\" \"Where was I?\"\r\nrejoined the gallant; \"that know not I. 'Tis indeed betimes that the news\r\nhas reached you.\" \"True indeed it is,\" said the friar, \"that the news has\r\nreached me: I suppose that, because the husband was not there, thou never\r\ndoubtedst that thou wouldst forthwith be received by the lady with open\r\narms. Ah! the gay gallant! the honourable gentleman! he is now turned\r\nprowler by night, and breaks into gardens, and climbs trees! Dost thou think\r\nby sheer importunity to vanquish the virtue of this lady, that thou\r\nescaladest her windows at night by the trees? She dislikes thee of all\r\nthings in the world, and yet thou must still persist. Well indeed hast thou\r\nlaid my admonitions to heart, to say nothing of the many proofs which she\r\nhas given thee of her disdain! But I have yet a word for thee: hitherto, not\r\nthat she bears thee any love, but that she has yielded to my urgent prayers,\r\nshe has kept silence as to thy misdeeds: she will do so no more: I have\r\ngiven her leave to act as she may think fit, if thou givest her any further\r\nannoyance. And what wilt thou do if she informs her brothers?\" The gallant,\r\nnow fully apprised of what it imported him to know, was profuse in promises,\r\nwhereby as best he might he reassured the friar, and so left him. The very\r\nnext night, as soon as the matin hour was come, he entered the garden,\r\nclimbed up the tree, found the window open, entered the chamber, and in a\r\ntrice was in the embrace of his fair lady. Anxiously had she expected him,\r\nand blithely did she now greet him, saying:--\"All thanks to master friar\r\nthat he so well taught thee the way hither.\" Then, with many a jest and\r\nlaugh at the simplicity of the asinine friar, and many a flout at\r\ndistaff-fuls and combs and cards, they solaced themselves with one another\r\nto their no small delight. Nor did they omit so to arrange matters that they\r\nwere well able to dispense with master friar, and yet pass many another\r\nnight together with no less satisfaction: to which goal I pray that I, and\r\nall other Christian souls that are so minded, may be speedily guided of God\r\nin His holy mercy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL IV.\r\n\r\n--\r\nDom Felice instructs Fra Puccio how to attain blessedness by doing a\r\npenance. Fra Puccio does the penance, and meanwhile Dom Felice has a good\r\ntime with Fra Puccio's wife.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen Filomena, having concluded her story, was silent, and Dioneo had added\r\na few honeyed phrases in praise of the lady's wit and Filomena's closing\r\nprayer, the queen glanced with a smile to Pamfilo, and said:--\"Now, Pamfilo,\r\ngive us some pleasant trifle to speed our delight.\" \"That gladly will I,\"\r\nreturned forthwith Pamfilo, and then:--\"Madam,\" he began, \"not a few there\r\nare that, while they use their best endeavours to get themselves places in\r\nParadise, do, by inadvertence, send others thither: as did, not long ago,\r\nbetide a fair neighbour of ours, as you shall hear.\r\n\r\nHard by San Pancrazio there used to live, as I have heard tell, a worthy man\r\nand wealthy, Puccio di Rinieri by name, who in later life, under an\r\noverpowering sense of religion, became a tertiary of the order of St.\r\nFrancis, and was thus known as Fra Puccio. In which spiritual life he was\r\nthe better able to persevere that his household consisted but of a wife and\r\na maid, and having no need to occupy himself with any craft, he spent no\r\nsmall part of his time at church; where, being a simple soul and slow of\r\nwit, he said his paternosters, heard sermons, assisted at the mass, never\r\nmissed lauds (i. e. when chanted by the seculars), fasted and mortified his\r\nflesh; nay--so 'twas whispered--he was of the Flagellants. His wife, Monna\r\nIsabetta by name, a woman of from twenty-eight to thirty summers, still\r\nyoung for her age, lusty, comely and plump as a casolan(1) apple, had not\r\nunfrequently, by reason of her husband's devoutness, if not also of his age,\r\nmore than she cared for, of abstinence; and when she was sleepy, or, maybe,\r\nriggish, he would repeat to her the life of Christ, and the sermons of Fra\r\nNastagio, or the lament of the Magdalen, or the like. Now, while such was\r\nthe tenor of her life, there returned from Paris a young monk, by name Dom\r\nFelice, of the convent of San Pancrazio, a well-favoured man and\r\nkeen-witted, and profoundly learned, with whom Fra Puccio became very\r\nintimate; and as there was no question which he could put to him but Dom\r\nFelice could answer it, and moreover he made great shew of holiness, for\r\nwell he knew Fra Puccio's bent, Fra Puccio took to bringing him home and\r\nentertaining him at breakfast and supper, as occasion served; and for love\r\nof her husband the lady also grew familiar with Dom Felice, and was zealous\r\nto do him honour. So the monk, being a constant visitor at Fra Puccio's\r\nhouse, and seeing the lady so lusty and plump, surmised that of which she\r\nmust have most lack, and made up his mind to afford, if he could, at once\r\nrelief to Fra Puccio and contentment to the lady. So cautiously, now and\r\nagain, he cast an admiring glance in her direction with such effect that he\r\nkindled in her the same desire with which he burned, and marking his\r\nsuccess, took the first opportunity to declare his passion to her. He found\r\nher fully disposed to gratify it; but how this might be, he was at a loss to\r\ndiscover, for she would not trust herself with him in any place whatever\r\nexcept her own house, and there it could not be, because Fra Puccio never\r\ntravelled; whereby the monk was greatly dejected. Long he pondered the\r\nmatter, and at length thought of an expedient, whereby he might be with the\r\nlady in her own house without incurring suspicion, notwithstanding that Fra\r\nPuccio was there. So, being with Fra Puccio one day, he said to him:--\r\n\"Reasons many have I to know, Fra Puccio, that all thy desire is to become a\r\nsaint; but it seems to me that thou farest by a circuitous route, whereas\r\nthere is one very direct, which the Pope and the greater prelates that are\r\nabout him know and use, but will have it remain a secret, because otherwise\r\nthe clergy, who for the most part live by alms, and could not then expect\r\nalms or aught else from the laity, would be speedily ruined. However, as\r\nthou art my friend, and hast shewn me much honour, I would teach thee that\r\nway, if I were assured that thou wouldst follow it without letting another\r\nsoul in the world hear of it.\" Fra Puccio was now all agog to hear more of\r\nthe matter, and began most earnestly entreating Dom Felice to teach him the\r\nway, swearing that without Dom Felice's leave none should ever hear of it\r\nfrom him, and averring that, if he found it practicable, he would certainly\r\nfollow it. \"I am satisfied with thy promises,\" said the monk, \"and I will\r\nshew thee the way. Know then that the holy doctors hold that whoso would\r\nachieve blessedness must do the penance of which I shall tell thee; but see\r\nthou take me judiciously. I do not say that after the penance thou wilt not\r\nbe a sinner, as thou art; but the effect will be that the sins which thou\r\nhast committed up to the very hour of the penance will all be purged away\r\nand thereby remitted to thee, and the sins which thou shalt commit\r\nthereafter will not be written against thee to thy damnation, but will be\r\nquit by holy water, like venial sins. First of all then the penitent must\r\nwith great exactitude confess his sins when he comes to begin the penance.\r\nThen follows a period of fasting and very strict abstinence which must last\r\nfor forty days, during which time he is to touch no woman whomsoever, not\r\neven his wife. Moreover, thou must have in thy house some place whence thou\r\nmayst see the sky by night, whither thou must resort at compline; and there\r\nthou must have a beam, very broad, and placed in such a way, that, standing,\r\nthou canst rest thy nether part upon it, and so, not raising thy feet from\r\nthe ground, thou must extend thy arms, so as to make a sort of crucifix, and\r\nif thou wouldst have pegs to rest them on thou mayst; and on this manner,\r\nthy gaze fixed on the sky, and never moving a jot, thou must stand until\r\nmatins. And wert thou lettered, it were proper for thee to say meanwhile\r\ncertain prayers that I would give thee; but as thou art not so, thou must\r\nsay three hundred paternosters and as many avemarias in honour of the\r\nTrinity; and thus contemplating the sky, be ever mindful that God was the\r\ncreator of the heaven and the earth, and being set even as Christ was upon\r\nthe cross, meditate on His passion. Then, when the matin-bell sounds, thou\r\nmayst, if thou please, go to bed--but see that thou undress not--and sleep;\r\nbut in the morning thou must go to church, and hear at least three masses,\r\nand say fifty paternosters and as many avemarias; after which thou mayst\r\nwith a pure heart do aught that thou hast to do, and breakfast; but at\r\nvespers thou must be again at church, and say there certain prayers, which I\r\nshall give thee in writing and which are indispensable, and after compline\r\nthou must repeat thy former exercise. Do this, and I, who have done it\r\nbefore thee, have good hope that even before thou shalt have reached the end\r\nof the penance, thou wilt, if thou shalt do it in a devout spirit, have\r\nalready a marvellous foretaste of the eternal blessedness.\" \"This,\" said Fra\r\nPuccio, \"is neither a very severe nor a very long penance, and can be very\r\neasily managed: wherefore in God's name I will begin on Sunday.\" And so he\r\ntook his leave of Dom Felice, and went home, and, by Dom Felice's\r\npermission, informed his wife of every particular of his intended penance.\r\n\r\nThe lady understood very well what the monk meant by enjoining him not to\r\nstir from his post until matins; and deeming it an excellent device, she\r\nsaid that she was well content that he should do this or aught else that he\r\nthought good for his soul; and to the end that his penance might be blest\r\nof, she would herself fast with him, though she would go no further. So they\r\ndid as they had agreed: when Sunday came Fra Puccio began his penance, and\r\nmaster monk, by understanding with the lady, came most evenings, at the hour\r\nwhen he was secure from discovery, to sup with her, always bringing with him\r\nabundance both of meat and of drink, and after slept with her till the matin\r\nhour, when he got up and left her, and Fra Puccio went to bed. The place\r\nwhich Fra Puccio had chosen for his penance was close to the room in which\r\nthe lady slept, and only separated from it by the thinnest of partitions; so\r\nthat, the monk and the lady disporting themselves with one another without\r\nstint or restraint, Fra Puccio thought he felt the floor of the house shake\r\na little, and pausing at his hundredth paternoster, but without leaving his\r\npost, called out to the lady to know what she was about. The lady, who\r\ndearly loved a jest, and was just then riding the horse of St. Benedict or\r\nSt. John Gualbert, answered:--\"I'faith, husband, I am as restless as may\r\nbe.\" \"Restless,\" said Fra Puccio, \"how so? What means this restlessness?\"\r\nWhereto with a hearty laugh, for which she doubtless had good occasion, the\r\nbonny lady replied:--\"What means it? How should you ask such a question?\r\nWhy, I have heard you say a thousand times:--'Who fasting goes to bed,\r\nuneasy lies his head.'\" Fra Puccio, supposing that her wakefulness and\r\nrestlessness abed was due to want of food, said in good faith:--\"Wife, I\r\ntold thee I would have thee not fast; but as thou hast chosen to fast, think\r\nnot of it, but think how thou mayst compose thyself to sleep; thou tossest\r\nabout the bed in such sort that the shaking is felt here.\" \"That need cause\r\nthee no alarm,\" rejoined the lady. \"I know what I am about; I will manage as\r\nwell as I can, and do thou likewise.\" So Fra Puccio said no more to her, but\r\nresumed his paternosters; and thenceforth every night, while Fra Puccio's\r\npenance lasted, the lady and master monk, having had a bed made up for them\r\nin another part of the house, did there wanton it most gamesomely, the monk\r\ndeparting and the lady going back to her bed at one and the same time, being\r\nshortly before Fra Puccio's return from his nightly vigil. The friar thus\r\npersisting in his penance while the lady took her fill of pleasure with the\r\nmonk, she would from time to time say jestingly to him:--\"Thou layest a\r\npenance upon Fra Puccio whereby we are rewarded with Paradise.\" So well\r\nindeed did she relish the dainties with which the monk regaled her, the more\r\nso by contrast with the abstemious life to which her husband had long\r\naccustomed her, that, when Fra Puccio's penance was done, she found means to\r\nenjoy them elsewhere, and ordered her indulgence with such discretion as to\r\nensure its long continuance. Whereby (that my story may end as it began) it\r\ncame to pass that Fra Puccio, hoping by his penance to win a place for\r\nhimself in Paradise, did in fact translate thither the monk who had shewn\r\nhim the way, and the wife who lived with him in great dearth of that of\r\nwhich the monk in his charity gave her superabundant largess.\r\n\r\n(1) Perhaps from Casoli, near Naples.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL V.\r\n\r\n--\r\nZima gives a palfrey to Messer Francesco Vergellesi, who in return suffers\r\nhim to speak with his wife. She keeping silence, he answers in her stead,\r\nand the sequel is in accordance with his answer.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen Pamfilo had brought the story of Fra Puccio to a close amid the\r\nlaughter of the ladies, the queen debonairly bade Elisa follow suit; and\r\nshe, whose manner had in it a slight touch of severity, which betokened not\r\ndespite, but was habitual to her, thus began:--\r\n\r\nMany there are that, being very knowing, think that others are quite the\r\nreverse; and so, many a time, thinking to beguile others, are themselves\r\nbeguiled; wherefore I deem it the height of folly for any one wantonly to\r\nchallenge another to a contest of wit. But, as, perchance, all may not be of\r\nthe same opinion, I am minded, without deviating from the prescribed order,\r\nto acquaint you with that which thereby befell a certain knight of Pistoia.\r\nKnow then that at Pistoia there lived a knight, Messer Francesco, by name,\r\nof the Vergellesi family, a man of much wealth and good parts, being both\r\nwise and clever, but withal niggardly beyond measure. Which Messer\r\nFrancesco, having to go to Milan in the capacity of podesta, had provided\r\nhimself with all that was meet for the honourable support of such a dignity,\r\nsave only a palfrey handsome enough for him; and not being able to come by\r\nany such, he felt himself at a loss. Now there was then in Pistoia a young\r\nman, Ricciardo by name, of low origin but great wealth, who went always so\r\ntrim and fine and foppish of person, that folk had bestowed upon him the\r\nname of Zima,(1) by which he was generally known. Zima had long and to no\r\npurpose burned and yearned for love of Messer Francesco's very fair and no\r\nless virtuous wife. His passion was matter of common notoriety; and so it\r\nbefell that some one told Messer Francesco that he had but to ask Zima, who\r\nwas the possessor of one of the handsomest palfreys in Tuscany, which on\r\nthat account he greatly prized, and he would not hesitate to give him the\r\nhorse for the love which he bore his wife. So our niggardly knight sent for\r\nZima, and offered to buy the horse of him, hoping thereby to get him from\r\nZima as a gift. Zima heard the knight gladly, and thus made answer:--\"Sell\r\nyou my horse, Sir, I would not, though you gave me all that you have in the\r\nworld; but I shall be happy to give him to you, when you will, on this\r\ncondition, that, before he pass into your hands, I may by your leave and in\r\nyour presence say a few words to your wife so privately that I may be heard\r\nby her alone.\" Thinking at once to gratify his cupidity and to outwit Zima,\r\nthe knight answered that he was content that it should be even as Zima\r\nwished. Then, leaving him in the hall of the palace, he went to his lady's\r\nchamber, and told her the easy terms on which he might acquire the palfrey,\r\nbidding her give Zima his audience, but on no account to vouchsafe him a\r\nword of reply. This the lady found by no means to her mind, but, as she must\r\nneeds obey her husband's commands, she promised compliance, and followed him\r\ninto the hall to hear what Zima might have to say. Zima then renewed his\r\ncontract with the knight in due form; whereupon, the lady being seated in a\r\npart of the hall where she was quite by herself, he sate down by her side,\r\nand thus began:--\"Noble lady, I have too much respect for your understanding\r\nto doubt that you have long been well aware of the extremity of passion\r\nwhereto I have been brought by your beauty, which certainly exceeds that of\r\nany other lady that I have ever seen, to say nothing of your exquisite\r\nmanners and incomparable virtues, which might well serve to captivate every\r\nsoaring spirit that is in the world; wherefore there need no words of mine\r\nto assure you that I love you with a love greater and more ardent than any\r\nthat man yet bore to woman, and so without doubt I shall do, as long as my\r\nwoful life shall hold this frame together; nay, longer yet, for, if love\r\nthere be in the next world as in this, I shall love you evermore. And so you\r\nmay make your mind secure that there is nothing that is yours, be it\r\nprecious or be it common, which you may count as in such and so sure a sort\r\nyour own as me, for all that I am and have. And that thereof you may not\r\nlack evidence of infallible cogency, I tell you, that I should deem myself\r\nmore highly favoured, if I might at your command do somewhat to pleasure\r\nyou, than if at my command the whole world were forthwith to yield me\r\nobedience. And as 'tis even in such sort that I am yours, 'tis not\r\nunworthily that I make bold to offer my petitions to Your Highness, as being\r\nto me the sole, exclusive source of all peace, of all bliss, of all health.\r\nWherefore, as your most lowly vassal, I pray you, dear my bliss, my soul's\r\none hope, wherein she nourishes herself in love's devouring flame, that in\r\nyour great benignity you deign so far to mitigate the harshness which in the\r\npast you have shewn towards me, yours though I am, that, consoled by your\r\ncompassion, I may say, that, as 'twas by your beauty that I was smitten with\r\nlove, so 'tis to your pity that I owe my life, which, if in your haughtiness\r\nyou lend not ear unto my prayers, will assuredly fail, so that I shall die,\r\nand, it may be, 'twill be said that you slew me. 'Twould not redound to your\r\nhonour that I died for love of you; but let that pass; I cannot but think,\r\nhowever, that you would sometimes feel a touch of remorse, and would grieve\r\nthat 'twas your doing, and that now and again, relenting, you would say to\r\nyourself:--'Ah! how wrong it was of me that I had not pity on my Zima;' by\r\nwhich too late repentance you would but enhance your grief. Wherefore, that\r\nthis come not to pass, repent you while it is in your power to give me ease,\r\nand shew pity on me before I die, seeing that with you it rests to make me\r\neither the gladdest or the saddest man that lives. My trust is in your\r\ngenerosity, that 'twill not brook that a love so great and of such a sort as\r\nmine should receive death for guerdon, and that by a gladsome and gracious\r\nanswer you will repair my shattered spirits, which are all a-tremble in your\r\npresence for very fear.\" When he had done, he heaved several very deep\r\nsighs, and a few tears started from his eyes, while he awaited the lady's\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nLong time he had wooed her with his eyes, had tilted in her honour, had\r\ngreeted her rising with music; and against these and all like modes of\r\nattack she had been proof; but the heartfelt words of her most ardent lover\r\nwere not without their effect, and she now began to understand what she had\r\nnever till then understood, to wit, what love really means. So, albeit she\r\nobeyed her lord's behest, and kept silence, yet she could not but betray by\r\na slight sigh that which, if she might have given Zima his answer, she would\r\nreadily have avowed. After waiting a while, Zima found it strange that no\r\nanswer was forthcoming; and he then began to perceive the trick which the\r\nknight had played him. However, he kept his eyes fixed on the lady, and\r\nobserving that her eyes glowed now and again, as they met his, and noting\r\nthe partially suppressed sighs which escaped her, he gathered a little hope,\r\nwhich gave him courage to try a novel plan of attack. So, while the lady\r\nlistened, he began to make answer for her to himself on this wise:--\"Zima\r\nmine, true indeed it is that long since I discerned that thou didst love me\r\nwith a love exceeding great and whole-hearted, whereof I have now yet ampler\r\nassurance by thine own words, and well content I am therewith, as indeed I\r\nought to be. And however harsh and cruel I may have seemed to thee, I would\r\nby no means have thee believe, that I have been such at heart as I have\r\nseemed in aspect; rather, be assured that I have ever loved thee and held\r\nthee dear above all other men; the mien which I have worn was but prescribed\r\nby fear of another and solicitude for my fair fame. But a time will soon\r\ncome when I shall be able to give thee plain proof of my love, and to accord\r\nthe love which thou hast borne and dost bear me its due guerdon. Wherefore\r\nbe comforted and of good hope; for, Messer Francesco is to go in a few days'\r\ntime to Milan as podesta, as thou well knowest, seeing that for love of me\r\nthou hast given him thy fine palfrey; and I vow to thee upon my faith, upon\r\nthe true love which I bear thee, that without fail, within a few days\r\nthereafter thou shalt be with me, and we will give our love complete and\r\ngladsome consummation. And that I may have no more occasion to speak to thee\r\nof this matter, be it understood between us that henceforth when thou shalt\r\nobserve two towels disposed at the window of my room which overlooks the\r\ngarden, thou shalt come to me after nightfall of that same day by the garden\r\ndoor (and look well to it that thou be not seen), and thou shalt find me\r\nwaiting for thee, and we will have our fill of mutual cheer and solace all\r\nnight long.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus answered for the lady, Zima resumed his own person and thus\r\nreplied to the lady:--\"Dearest madam, your boon response so overpowers my\r\nevery faculty that scarce can I frame words to render you due thanks; and,\r\nwere I able to utter all I feel, time, however long, would fail me fully to\r\nthank you as I would fain and as I ought: wherefore I must even leave it to\r\nyour sage judgment to divine that which I yearn in vain to put in words. Let\r\nthis one word suffice, that as you bid me, so I shall not fail to do; and\r\nthen, having, perchance, firmer assurance of the great boon which you have\r\ngranted me, I will do my best endeavour to thank you in terms the amplest\r\nthat I may command. For the present there is no more to say; and so, dearest\r\nmy lady, I commend you to God; and may He grant you your heart's content of\r\njoy and bliss.\" To all which the lady returned never a word: wherefore Zima\r\nrose and turned to rejoin the knight, who, seeing him on his feet, came\r\ntowards him, and said with a laugh:--\"How sayst thou? Have I faithfully kept\r\nmy promise to thee?\" \"Not so, Sir,\" replied Zima; \"for by thy word I was to\r\nhave spoken with thy wife, and by thy deed I have spoken to a statue of\r\nmarble.\" Which remark was much relished by the knight, who, well as he had\r\nthought of his wife, thought now even better of her, and said:--\"So thy\r\npalfrey, that was, is now mine out and out.\" \"'Tis even so, Sir,\" replied\r\nZima; \"but had I thought to have gotten such fruit as I have from this\r\nfavour of yours, I would not have craved it, but would have let you have the\r\npalfrey as a free gift: and would to God I had done so, for, as it is, you\r\nhave bought the palfrey and I have not sold him.\" This drew a laugh from the\r\nknight, who within a few days thereafter mounted the palfrey which he had\r\ngotten, and took the road for Milan, there to enter on his podestate. The\r\nlady, now mistress of herself, bethought her of Zima's words, and the love\r\nwhich he bore her, and for which he had parted with his palfrey; and\r\nobserving that he frequently passed her house, said to herself:--\"What am I\r\nabout? Why throw I my youth away? My husband is gone to Milan, and will not\r\nreturn for six months, and when can he ever restore them to me? When I am\r\nold! And besides, shall I ever find another such lover as Zima? I am quite\r\nby myself. There is none to fear, I know not why I take not my good time\r\nwhile I may: I shall not always have the like opportunity as at present: no\r\none will ever know; and if it should get known, 'tis better to do and repent\r\nthan to forbear and repent.\" Of which meditations the issue was that one day\r\nshe set two towels in the window overlooking the garden, according to Zima's\r\nword, and Zima having marked them with much exultation, stole at nightfall\r\nalone to the door of the lady's garden, and finding it open, crossed to\r\nanother door that led into the house, where he found the lady awaiting him.\r\nOn sight of him she rose to meet him, and gave him the heartiest of\r\nwelcomes. A hundred thousand times he embraced and kissed her, as he\r\nfollowed her upstairs: then without delay they hied them to bed, and knew\r\nlove's furthest bourne. And so far was the first time from being in this\r\ncase the last, that, while the knight was at Milan, and indeed after his\r\nreturn, there were seasons not a few at which Zima resorted thither to the\r\nimmense delight of both parties.\r\n\r\n(1) From the Low Latin aczima, explained by Du Cange as \"tonture de draps,\"\r\nthe process of dressing cloth so as to give it an even nap. Zima is thus\r\nequivalent to \"nitidus.\" Cf. Vocab. degli Accademici della Crusca,\r\n\"Azzimare.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VI.\r\n\r\n--\r\nRicciardo Minutolo loves the wife of Filippello Fighinolfi, and knowing her\r\nto be jealous, makes her believe that his own wife is to meet Filippello at\r\na bagnio on the ensuing day; whereby she is induced to go thither, where,\r\nthinking to have been with her husband, she discovers that she has tarried\r\nwith Ricciardo.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen Elisa had quite done, the queen, after some commendation of Zima's\r\nsagacity, bade Fiammetta follow with a story. Whereto Fiammetta, all smiles,\r\nresponded:--\"Madam, with all my heart;\" and thus began:--\r\n\r\nRichly though our city abounds, as in all things else, so also in instances\r\nto suit every topic, yet I am minded to journey some distance thence, and,\r\nlike Elisa, to tell you something of what goes on in other parts of the\r\nworld: wherefore pass we to Naples, where you shall hear how one of these\r\nsanctified that shew themselves so shy of love, was by the subtlety of her\r\nlover brought to taste of the fruit before she had known the flowers of\r\nlove; whereby at one and the same time you may derive from the past counsel\r\nof prudence for the future, and present delectation.\r\n\r\nIn the very ancient city of Naples, which for loveliness has not its\r\nsuperior or perhaps its equal in Italy, there once lived a young man,\r\nrenowned alike for noble blood and the splendour of his vast wealth, his\r\nname Ricciardo Minutolo. He was mated with a very fair and loving wife; but\r\nnevertheless he became enamoured of a lady who in the general opinion vastly\r\nsurpassed in beauty every other lady in Naples. Catella--such was the lady's\r\nname--was married to a young man, likewise of gentle blood, Filippello\r\nFighinolfi by name, whom she, most virtuous of ladies, loved and held dear\r\nabove all else in the world. Being thus enamoured of Catella, Ricciardo\r\nMinutolo left none of those means untried whereby a lady's favour and love\r\nare wont to be gained, but for all that he made no way towards the\r\nattainment of his heart's desire: whereby he fell into a sort of despair,\r\nand witless and powerless to loose himself from his love, found life scarce\r\ntolerable, and yet knew not how to die. While in this frame he languished,\r\nit befell one day that some ladies that were of kin to him counselled him\r\nearnestly to be quit of such a love, whereby he could but fret himself to no\r\npurpose, seeing that Catella cared for nought in the world save Filippello,\r\nand lived in such a state of jealousy on his account that never a bird flew\r\nbut she feared lest it should snatch him from her. So soon as Ricciardo\r\nheard of Catella's jealousy, he forthwith began to ponder how he might make\r\nit subserve his end. He feigned to have given up his love for Catella as\r\nhopeless, and to have transferred it to another lady, in whose honour he\r\naccordingly began to tilt and joust and do all that he had been wont to do\r\nin honour of Catella. Nor was it long before well-nigh all the Neapolitans,\r\nincluding Catella herself, began to think that he had forgotten Catella, and\r\nwas to the last degree enamoured of the other lady. In this course he\r\npersisted, until the opinion was so firmly rooted in the minds of all that\r\neven Catella laid aside a certain reserve which she had used towards him\r\nwhile she deemed him her lover, and, coming and going, greeted him in\r\nfriendly, neighbourly fashion, like the rest. Now it so befell that during\r\nthe hot season, when, according to the custom of the Neapolitans, many\r\ncompanies of ladies and gentlemen went down to the sea-coast to recreate\r\nthemselves and breakfast and sup, Ricciardo, knowing that Catella was gone\r\nthither with her company, went likewise with his, but, making as if he were\r\nnot minded to stay there, he received several invitations from the ladies of\r\nCatella's company before he accepted any. When the ladies received him, they\r\nall with one accord, including Catella, began to rally him on his new love,\r\nand he furnished them with more matter for talk by feigning a most ardent\r\npassion. At length most of the ladies being gone off, one hither, another\r\nthither, as they do in such places, leaving Catella and a few others with\r\nRicciardo, he tossed at Catella a light allusion to a certain love of her\r\nhusband Filippello, which threw her at once into such a fit of jealousy,\r\nthat she inly burned with a vehement desire to know what Ricciardo meant.\r\nFor a while she kept her own counsel; then, brooking no more suspense, she\r\nadjured Ricciardo, by the love he bore the lady whom most he loved, to\r\nexpound to her what he had said touching Filippello. He answered thus:--\"You\r\nhave adjured me by her to whom I dare not deny aught that you may ask of me;\r\nmy riddle therefore I will presently read you, provided you promise me that\r\nneither to him nor to any one else will you impart aught of what I shall\r\nrelate to you, until you shall have ocular evidence of its truth; which, so\r\nyou desire it, I will teach you how you may obtain.\" The lady accepted his\r\nterms, which rather confirmed her belief in his veracity, and swore that she\r\nwould not tell a soul. They then drew a little apart, that they might not be\r\noverheard by the rest, and Ricciardo thus began:--\"Madam, did I love you, as\r\nI once did, I should not dare to tell you aught that I thought might cause\r\nyou pain; but, now that that love is past, I shall have the less hesitation\r\nin telling you the truth. Whether Filippello ever resented the love which I\r\nbore you, or deemed that it was returned by you, I know not: whether it were\r\nso or no, he certainly never shewed any such feeling to me; but so it is\r\nthat now, having waited, perhaps, until, as he supposes, I am less likely to\r\nbe on my guard, he shews a disposition to serve me as I doubt he suspects\r\nthat I served him; that is to say, he would fain have his pleasure of my\r\nwife, whom for some time past he has, as I discover, plied with messages\r\nthrough most secret channels. She has told me all, and has answered him\r\naccording to my instructions: but only this morning, just before I came\r\nhither, I found a woman in close parley with her in the house, whose true\r\ncharacter and purpose I forthwith divined; so I called my wife, and asked\r\nwhat the woman wanted. Whereto she answered:--''Tis this persecution by\r\nFilippello which thou hast brought upon me by the encouraging answers that\r\nthou wouldst have me give him: he now tells me that he is most earnestly\r\ndesirous to know my intentions, and that, should I be so minded, he would\r\ncontrive that I should have secret access to a bagnio in this city, and he\r\nis most urgent and instant that I should consent. And hadst thou not,\r\nwherefore I know not, bidden me keep the affair afoot, I would have\r\ndismissed him in such a sort that my movements would have been exempt from\r\nhis prying observation for ever.' Upon this I saw that the affair was going\r\ntoo far; I determined to have no more of it, and to let you know it, that\r\nyou may understand how he requites your whole-hearted faith, which brought\r\nme of late to the verge of death. And that you may not suppose that these\r\nare but empty words and idle tales, but may be able, should you so desire,\r\nto verify them by sight and touch, I caused my wife to tell the woman who\r\nstill waited her answer, that she would be at the bagnio to-morrow about\r\nnone, during the siesta: with which answer the woman went away well content.\r\nNow you do not, I suppose, imagine that I would send her thither; but if I\r\nwere in your place, he should find me there instead of her whom he thinks to\r\nfind there; and when I had been some little time with him, I would give him\r\nto understand with whom he had been, and he should have of me such honour as\r\nhe deserved. Whereby, I doubt not, he would be put to such shame as would at\r\none and the same time avenge both the wrong which he has done to you and\r\nthat which he plots against me.\"\r\n\r\nCatella, as is the wont of the jealous, hearkened to Ricciardo's words\r\nwithout so much as giving a thought to the speaker or his wiles, inclined at\r\nonce to credit his story, and began to twist certain antecedent matters into\r\naccord with it; then, suddenly kindling with wrath, she answered that to the\r\nbagnio she would certainly go; 'twould cause her no great inconvenience, and\r\nif he should come, she would so shame him that he should never again set\r\neyes on woman but his ears would tingle. Satisfied by what he heard, that\r\nhis stratagem was well conceived, and success sure, Ricciardo added much in\r\ncorroboration of his story, and having thus confirmed her belief in it,\r\nbesought her to keep it always close, whereto she pledged her faith.\r\n\r\nNext morning Ricciardo hied him to the good woman that kept the bagnio to\r\nwhich he had directed Catella, told her the enterprise which he had in hand,\r\nand prayed her to aid him therein so far as she might be able. The good\r\nwoman, who was much beholden to him, assured him that she would gladly do\r\nso, and concerted with him all that was to be said and done. She had in the\r\nbagnio a room which was very dark, being without any window to admit the\r\nlight. This room, by Ricciardo's direction, she set in order, and made up a\r\nbed there as well as she could, into which bed Ricciardo got, as soon as he\r\nhad breakfasted, and there awaited Catella's coming.\r\n\r\nNow Catella, still giving more credence to Ricciardo's story than it\r\nmerited, had gone home in the evening in a most resentful mood, and\r\nFilippello, returning home the same evening with a mind greatly preoccupied,\r\nwas scarce as familiar with her as he was wont to be. Which she marking,\r\ngrew yet more suspicious than before, and said to herself:--\"Doubtless he is\r\nthinking of the lady of whom he expects to take his pleasure to-morrow, as\r\nmost assuredly he shall not;\" and so, musing and meditating what she should\r\nsay to him after their rencounter at the bagnio, she spent the best part of\r\nthe night. But--to shorten my story--upon the stroke of none Catella, taking\r\nwith her a single attendant, but otherwise adhering to her original\r\nintention, hied her to the bagnio which Ricciardo had indicated; and finding\r\nthe good woman there, asked her whether Filippello had been there that day.\r\nPrimed by Ricciardo, the good woman asked her, whether she were the lady\r\nthat was to come to speak with him; to which she answered in the\r\naffirmative. \"Go to him, then,\" said the good woman. And so Catella, in\r\nquest of that which she would gladly not have found, was shewn to the\r\nchamber where Ricciardo was, and having entered without uncovering her head,\r\nclosed the door behind her. Overjoyed to see her, Ricciardo sprang out of\r\nbed, took her in his arms, and said caressingly:--\"Welcome, my soul.\"\r\nCatella, dissembling, for she was minded at first to counterfeit another\r\nwoman, returned his embrace, kissed him, and lavished endearments upon him;\r\nsaying, the while, not a word, lest her speech should betray her. The\r\ndarkness of the room, which was profound, was equally welcome to both; nor\r\nwere they there long enough for their eyes to recover power. Ricciardo\r\nhelped Catella on to the bed, where, with no word said on either side in a\r\nvoice that might be recognized, they lay a long while, much more to the\r\nsolace and satisfaction of the one than of the other party. Then, Catella,\r\ndeeming it high time to vent her harboured resentment, burst forth in a\r\nblaze of wrath on this wise:--\"Alas! how wretched is the lot of women, how\r\nmisplaced of not a few the love they bear their husbands! Ah, woe is me! for\r\neight years have I loved thee more dearly than my life; and now I find that\r\nthou, base miscreant that thou art, dost nought but burn and languish for\r\nlove of another woman! Here thou hast been--with whom, thinkest thou? Even\r\nwith her whom thou hast too long deluded with thy false blandishments,\r\nmaking pretence to love her while thou art enamoured of another. 'Tis I,\r\nCatella, not the wife of Ricciardo, false traitor that thou art; list if\r\nthou knowest my voice; 'tis I indeed! Ah! would we were but in the light!--\r\nit seems to me a thousand years till then--that I might shame thee as thou\r\ndeservest, vile, pestilent dog that thou art! Alas! woe is me! such love as\r\nI have borne so many years--to whom? To this faithless dog, that, thinking\r\nto have a strange woman in his embrace, has in the brief while that I have\r\nbeen with him here lavished upon me more caresses and endearments than\r\nduring all the forepast time that I have been his! A lively spark indeed art\r\nthou to-day, renegade dog, that shewest thyself so limp and enervate and\r\nimpotent at home! But, God be praised, thou hast tilled thine own plot, and\r\nnot another's, as thou didst believe. No wonder that last night thou heldest\r\naloof from me; thou wast thinking of scattering thy seed elsewhere, and wast\r\nminded to shew thyself a lusty knight when thou shouldst join battle. But\r\npraise be to God and my sagacity, the water has nevertheless taken its\r\nproper course. Where is thy answer, culprit? Hast thou nought to say? Have\r\nmy words struck thee dumb? God's faith I know not why I forbear to pluck\r\nthine eyes out with my fingers. Thou thoughtest to perpetrate this treason\r\nwith no small secrecy; but, by God, one is as knowing as another; thy plot\r\nhas failed; I had better hounds on thy trail than thou didst think for.\"\r\nRicciardo, inly delighted by her words, made no answer, but embraced and\r\nkissed her more than ever, and overwhelmed her with his endearments. So she\r\ncontinued her reproaches, saying:--\"Ay, thou thinkest to cajole me with thy\r\nfeigned caresses, wearisome dog that thou art, and so to pacify and mollify\r\nme; but thou art mistaken. I shall never be mollified, until I have covered\r\nthee with infamy in the presence of all our kinsfolk and friends and\r\nneighbours. Am I not, miscreant, as fair as the wife of Ricciardo Minutolo?\r\nAm I not as good a lady as she? Why dost not answer, vile dog? Wherein has\r\nshe the advantage of me? Away with thee! touch me not; thou hast done feats\r\nof arms more than enough for to-day. Well I know that, now that thou knowest\r\nwho I am, thou wilt wreak thy will on me by force: but by God's grace I will\r\nyet disappoint thee. I know not why I forbear to send for Ricciardo, who\r\nloved me more than himself and yet was never able to boast that he had a\r\nsingle glance from me; nor know I why 'twere wrong to do so. Thou thoughtest\r\nto have his wife here, and 'tis no fault of thine that thou hadst her not:\r\nso, if I had him, thou couldst not justly blame me.\"\r\n\r\nEnough had now been said: the lady's mortification was extreme; and, as she\r\nended, Ricciardo bethought him that, if he suffered her, thus deluded, to\r\ndepart, much evil might ensue. He therefore resolved to make himself known,\r\nand disabuse her of her error. So, taking her in his arms, and clipping her\r\nso close that she could not get loose, he said:--\"Sweet my soul, be not\r\nwroth: that which, while artlessly I loved, I might not have, Love has\r\ntaught me to compass by guile: know that I am thy Ricciardo.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words and the voice, which she recognized, Catella started, and\r\nwould have sprung out of the bed; which being impossible, she essayed a cry;\r\nbut Ricciardo laid a hand upon her mouth, and closed it, saying:--\"Madam,\r\nthat which is done can never be undone, though you should cry out for the\r\nrest of your days, and should you in such or any other wise publish this\r\nmatter to any, two consequences will ensue. In the first place (and this is\r\na point which touches you very nearly) your honour and fair fame will be\r\nblasted; for, however you may say that I lured you hither by guile, I shall\r\ndeny it, and affirm, on the contrary, that I induced you to come hither by\r\npromises of money and gifts, and that 'tis but because you are vexed that\r\nwhat I gave you did not altogether come up to your expectations, that you\r\nmake such a cry and clamour; and you know that folk are more prone to\r\nbelieve evil than good, and therefore I am no less likely to be believed\r\nthan you. The further consequence will be mortal enmity between your husband\r\nand me, and the event were as like to be that I killed him as that he killed\r\nme: which if I did, you would never more know joy or peace. Wherefore, heart\r\nof my body, do not at one and the same time bring dishonour upon yourself\r\nand set your husband and me at strife and in jeopardy of our lives. You are\r\nnot the first, nor will you be the last to be beguiled; nor have I beguiled\r\nyou to rob you of aught, but for excess of love that I bear, and shall ever\r\nbear, you, being your most lowly vassal. And though it is now a great while\r\nthat I, and what I have and can and am worth, are yours, yet I am minded\r\nthat so it shall be henceforth more than ever before. Your discretion in\r\nother matters is not unknown to me, and I doubt not 'twill be equally\r\nmanifest in this.\"\r\n\r\nRicciardo's admonitions were received by Catella with many a bitter tear;\r\nbut though she was very wroth and very sad at heart, yet Ricciardo's true\r\nwords so far commanded the assent of her reason, that she acknowledged that\r\n'twas possible they might be verified by the event. Wherefore she made\r\nanswer:\u017a-\"Ricciardo, I know not how God will grant me patience to bear the\r\nvillainy and knavery which thou hast practised upon me; and though in this\r\nplace, to which simplicity and excess of jealousy guided my steps, I raise\r\nno cry, rest assured that I shall never be happy, until in one way or\r\nanother I know myself avenged of that which thou hast done to me. Wherefore\r\nunhand me, let me go: thou hast had thy desire of me, and hast tormented me\r\nto thy heart's content: 'tis time to release me; let me go, I pray thee.\"\r\nBut Ricciardo, seeing that she was still much ruffled in spirit, was\r\nresolved not to let her go, until he had made his peace with her. So he\r\naddressed himself to soothe her; and by dint of most dulcet phrases and\r\nentreaties and adjurations he did at last prevail with her to give him her\r\npardon; nay, by joint consent, they tarried there a great while to the\r\nexceeding great delight of both. Indeed the lady, finding her lover's kisses\r\nsmack much better than those of her husband, converted her asperity into\r\nsweetness, and from that day forth cherished a most tender love for\r\nRicciardo; whereof, using all circumspection, they many a time had solace.\r\nGod grant us solace of ours.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VII.\r\n\r\n--\r\nTedaldo, being in disfavour with his lady, departs from Florence. He returns\r\nthither after a while in the guise of a pilgrim, has speech of his lady, and\r\nmakes her sensible of her fault. Her husband, convicted of slaying him, he\r\ndelivers from peril of death, reconciles him with his brothers, and\r\nthereafter discreetly enjoys his lady.\r\n--\r\n\r\nSo ceased Fiammetta; and, when all had bestowed on her their meed of praise,\r\nthe queen--to lose no time--forthwith bade Emilia resume the narration. So\r\nthus Emilia began:--\r\n\r\nI am minded to return to our city, whence my two last predecessors saw fit\r\nto depart, and to shew you how one of our citizens recovered the lady he had\r\nlost. Know then that there was in Florence a young noble, his name Tedaldo\r\nElisei, who being beyond measure enamoured of a lady hight Monna Ermellina,\r\nwife of one Aldobrandino Palermini, and by reason of his admirable qualities\r\nrichly deserving to have his desire, found Fortune nevertheless adverse, as\r\nshe is wont to be to the prosperous. Inasmuch as, for some reason or\r\nanother, the lady, having shewn herself gracious towards Tedaldo for a\r\nwhile, completely altered her mien, and not only shewed him no further\r\nfavour, but would not so much as receive a message from him or suffer him to\r\nsee her face; whereby he fell a prey to a grievous and distressful\r\nmelancholy; but so well had he concealed his love that the cause of his\r\nmelancholy was surmised by none. He tried hard in divers ways to recover the\r\nlove which he deemed himself to have lost for no fault of his, and finding\r\nall his efforts unavailing, he resolved to bid the world adieu, that he\r\nmight not afford her who was the cause of his distress the satisfaction of\r\nseeing him languish. So he got together as much money as he might, and\r\nsecretly, no word said to friend or kinsman except only a familiar gossip,\r\nwho knew all, he took his departure for Ancona. Arrived there, he assumed\r\nthe name of Filippo Santodeccio, and having forgathered with a rich\r\nmerchant, entered his service. The merchant took him with him to Cyprus\r\naboard one of his ships, and was so well pleased with his bearing and\r\nbehaviour that he not only gave him a handsome salary but made him in a sort\r\nhis companion, and entrusted him with the management of no small part of his\r\naffairs: wherein he proved himself so apt and assiduous, that in the course\r\nof a few years he was himself established in credit and wealth and great\r\nrepute as a merchant. Seven years thus passed, during which, albeit his\r\nthoughts frequently reverted to his cruel mistress, and sorely love smote\r\nhim, and much he yearned to see her again, yet such was his firmness that he\r\ncame off conqueror, until one day in Cyprus it so befell that there was sung\r\nin his hearing a song that he had himself composed, and of which the theme\r\nwas the mutual love that was between his lady and him, and the delight that\r\nhe had of her; which as he heard, he found it incredible that she should\r\nhave forgotten him, and burned with such a desire to see her once more,\r\nthat, being able to hold out no longer, he made up his mind to return to\r\nFlorence. So, having set all his affairs in order, he betook him, attended\r\nonly by a single servant, to Ancona; whence he sent all his effects, as they\r\narrived, forward to Florence, consigning them to a friend of his Ancontan\r\npartner, and followed with his servant in the disguise of a pilgrim returned\r\nfrom the Holy Sepulchre. Arrived at Florence, he put up at a little hostelry\r\nkept by two brothers hard by his lady's house, whither he forthwith hied\r\nhim, hoping that, perchance, he might have sight of her from the street;\r\nbut, finding all barred and bolted, doors, windows and all else, he doubted\r\nmuch, she must be dead, or have removed thence. So, with a very heavy heart,\r\nhe returned to the house of the two brothers, and to his great surprise\r\nfound his own four brothers standing in front of it, all in black. He knew\r\nthat he was so changed from his former semblance, both in dress and in\r\nperson, that he might not readily be recognized, and he had therefore no\r\nhesitation in going up to a shoemaker and asking him why these men were all\r\ndressed in black. The shoemaker answered:--\"'Tis because 'tis not fifteen\r\ndays since a brother of theirs, Tedaldo by name, that had been long abroad,\r\nwas slain; and I understand that they have proved in court that one\r\nAldobrandino Palermini, who is under arrest, did the deed, because Tedaldo,\r\nwho loved his wife, was come back to Florence incognito to forgather with\r\nher.\" Tedaldo found it passing strange that there should be any one so like\r\nhim as to be mistaken for him, and deplored Aldobrandino's evil plight. He\r\nhad learned, however, that the lady was alive and well. So, as 'twas now\r\nnight, he hied him, much perplexed in mind, into the inn, and supped with\r\nhis servant. The bedroom assigned him was almost at the top of the house,\r\nand the bed was none of the best. Thoughts many and disquieting haunted his\r\nmind, and his supper had been but light. Whereby it befell that midnight\r\ncame and went, and Tedaldo was still awake. As thus he watched, he heard\r\nshortly after midnight, a noise as of persons descending from the roof into\r\nthe house, and then through the chinks of the door of his room he caught the\r\nflicker of an ascending light. Wherefore he stole softly to the door, and\r\npeeping through a chink to make out what was afoot, he saw a very fine young\r\nwoman bearing a light, and three men making towards her, being evidently\r\nthose that had descended from the roof. The men exchanged friendly greetings\r\nwith the young woman, and then one said to her:--\"Now, God be praised, we\r\nmay make our minds easy, for we are well assured that judgment for the death\r\nof Tedaldo Elisei is gotten by his brothers against Aldobrandino Palermini,\r\nand he has confessed, and the sentence is already drawn up; but still it\r\nbehoves us to hold our peace; for, should it ever get abroad that we were\r\nguilty, we shall stand in the like jeopardy as Aldobrandino.\" So saying,\r\nthey took leave of the woman, who seemed much cheered, and went to bed. What\r\nhe had heard set Tedaldo musing on the number and variety of the errors to\r\nwhich men are liable: as, first, how his brothers had mourned and interred a\r\nstranger in his stead, and then charged an innocent man upon false\r\nsuspicion, and by false witness brought him into imminent peril of death:\r\nfrom which he passed to ponder the blind severity of laws and magistrates,\r\nwho from misguided zeal to elicit the truth not unfrequently become\r\nruthless, and, adjudging that which is false, forfeit the title which they\r\nclaim of ministers of God and justice, and do but execute the mandates of\r\niniquity and the Evil One. And so he came at last to consider the\r\npossibility of saving Aldobrandino, and formed a plan for the purpose.\r\nAccordingly, on the morrow, when he was risen, he left his servant at the\r\ninn, and hied him alone, at what he deemed a convenient time, to his lady's\r\nhouse, where, finding, by chance, the door open, he entered, and saw his\r\nlady sitting, all tears and lamentations, in a little parlour on the\r\nground-floor. Whereat he all but wept for sympathy; and drawing near her, he\r\nsaid:--\"Madam, be not troubled in spirit: your peace is nigh you.\" Whereupon\r\nthe lady raised her head, and said between her sobs:--\"Good man, what dost\r\nthou, a pilgrim, if I mistake not, from distant parts, know either of my\r\npeace or of my affliction?\" \"Madam,\" returned the pilgrim, \"I am of\r\nConstantinople, and am but now come hither, at God's behest, that I may give\r\nyou laughter for tears, and deliver your husband from death.\" \"But,\" said\r\nthe lady, \"if thou art of Constantinople, and but now arrived, how is't that\r\nthou knowest either who my husband is, or who I am?\" Whereupon the pilgrim\r\ngave her the whole narrative, from the very beginning, of Aldobrandino's\r\nsufferings; he also told her, who she was, how long she had been married,\r\nand much besides that was known to him of her affairs: whereat the lady was\r\nlost in wonder, and, taking him to be a prophet, threw herself on her knees\r\nat his feet, and besought him for God's sake, if he were come to save\r\nAldobrandino, to lose no time, for the matter brooked no delay. Thus\r\nadjured, the pilgrim assumed an air of great sanctity, as he said:--\"Arise,\r\nMadam, weep not, but hearken diligently to what I shall say to you, and look\r\nto it that you impart it to none. I have it by revelation of God that the\r\ntribulation wherein you stand is come upon you in requital of a sin which\r\nyou did once commit, of which God is minded that this suffering be a partial\r\npurgation, and that you make reparation in full, if you would not find\r\nyourself in a far more grievous plight.\" \"Sir,\" replied the lady, \"many sins\r\nhave I committed, nor know I how among them all to single out that whereof,\r\nmore than another, God requires reparation at my hands--wherefore, if you\r\nknow it, tell it me, and what by way of reparation I may do, that will I\r\ndo.\" \"Madam,\" returned the pilgrim, \"well wot I what it is, nor shall I\r\nquestion you thereof for my better instruction, but that the rehearsal may\r\ngive you increase of remorse therefor. But pass we now to fact. Tell me,\r\nmind you ever to have had a lover?\" Whereat the lady heaved a deep sigh;\r\nthen, marvelling not a little, for she had thought 'twas known to none,\r\nalbeit on the day when the man was slain, who was afterwards buried as\r\nTedaldo, there had been some buzz about it, occasioned by some indiscreet\r\nwords dropped by Tedaldo's gossip and confidant, she made answer:--\"I see\r\nthat there is nought that men keep secret but God reveals it to you;\r\nwherefore I shall not endeavour to hide my secrets from you. True it is that\r\nin my youth I was beyond measure enamoured of the unfortunate young man\r\nwhose death is imputed to my husband; whom I mourned with grief unfeigned,\r\nfor, albeit I shewed myself harsh and cruel towards him before his\r\ndeparture, yet neither thereby, nor by his long absence, nor yet by his\r\ncalamitous death was my heart estranged from him.\" Then said the\r\npilgrim:--\"'Twas not the unfortunate young man now dead that you did love,\r\nbut Tedaldo Elisei. But let that pass; now tell me: wherefore lost he your\r\ngood graces? Did he ever offend you?\" \"Nay verily,\" answered the lady, \"he\r\nnever offended me at all. My harshness was prompted by an accursed friar, to\r\nwhom I once confessed, and who, when I told him of the love I bore Tedaldo,\r\nand my intimacy with him, made my ears so tingle and sing that I still\r\nshudder to think of it, warning me that, if I gave it not up, I should fall\r\ninto the jaws of the Devil in the abyss of hell, and be cast into the\r\navenging fire. Whereby I was so terrified that I quite made my mind up to\r\ndiscontinue my intimacy with him, and, to trench the matter, I would\r\nthenceforth have none of his letters or messages; and so, I suppose, he went\r\naway in despair, though I doubt not, had he persevered a while longer, I\r\nshould not have seen him wasting away like snow in sunshine without\r\nrelenting of my harsh resolve; for in sooth there was nothing in the world I\r\nwould so gladly have done.\" Then said the pilgrim:--\"Madam, 'tis this sin,\r\nand this only, that has brought upon you your present tribulation. I know\r\npositively that Tedaldo did never put force upon you: 'twas of your own free\r\nwill, and for that he pleased you, that you became enamoured of him, your\r\nconstant visitor, your intimate friend he became, because you yourself would\r\nhave it so; and in the course of your intimacy you shewed him such favour by\r\nword and deed that, if he loved you first, you multiplied his love full a\r\nthousandfold. And if so it was, and well I know it was so, what\r\njustification had you for thus harshly severing yourself from him? You\r\nshould have considered the whole matter before the die was cast, and not\r\nhave entered upon it, if you deemed you might have cause to repent you of it\r\nas a sin. As soon as he became yours, you became his. Had he not been yours,\r\nyou might have acted as you had thought fit, at your own unfettered\r\ndiscretion, but, as you were his, 'twas robbery, 'twas conduct most\r\ndisgraceful, to sever yourself from him against his will. Now you must know\r\nthat I am a friar; and therefore all the ways of friars are familiar to me;\r\nnor does it misbecome me, as it might another, to speak for your behoof\r\nsomewhat freely of them; as I am minded to do that you may have better\r\nunderstanding of them in the future than you would seem to have had in the\r\npast. Time was when the friars were most holy and worthy men, but those who\r\nto-day take the name and claim the reputation of friars have nought of the\r\nfriar save only the habit: nay, they have not even that: for, whereas their\r\nfounders ordained that their habits should be strait, of a sorry sort, and\r\nof coarse stuff, apt symbols of a soul that in arraying the body in so mean\r\na garb did despite to all things temporal, our modern friars will have them\r\nfull, and double, and resplendent, and of the finest stuff, and of a fashion\r\ngoodly and pontifical, wherein without shame they flaunt it like peacocks in\r\nthe church, in the piazza, even as do the laity in their robes. And as the\r\nfisherman casts his net into the stream with intent to take many fish at one\r\nthrow: so 'tis the main solicitude and study, art and craft of these friars\r\nto embrace and entangle within the ample folds of their vast swelling skirts\r\nbeguines, widows and other foolish women, ay, and men likewise in great\r\nnumber. Wherefore, to speak with more exactitude, the friars of to-day have\r\nnought of the habit of the friar save only the colour thereof. And, whereas\r\nthe friars of old time sought to win men to their salvation, those of to-day\r\nseek to win their women and their wealth; wherefore they have made it and\r\nmake it their sole concern by declamation and imagery to strike terror into\r\nthe souls of fools, and to make believe that sins are purged by alms and\r\nmasses; to the end that they, base wretches that have fled to friarage not\r\nto ensue holiness but to escape hardship, may receive from this man bread,\r\nfrom that man wine, and from the other man a donation for masses for the\r\nsouls of his dead. True indeed it is that sins are purged by almsgiving and\r\nprayer; but, did they who give the alms know, did they but understand to\r\nwhom they give them, they would be more apt to keep them to themselves, or\r\nthrow them to so many pigs. And, knowing that the fewer be they that share\r\ngreat riches, the greater their ease, 'tis the study of each how best by\r\ndeclamation and intimidation to oust others from that whereof he would fain\r\nbe the sole owner. They censure lust in men, that, they turning therefrom,\r\nthe sole use of their women may remain to the censors: they condemn usury\r\nand unlawful gains, that, being entrusted with the restitution thereof, they\r\nmay be able to enlarge their habits, and to purchase bishoprics and other\r\ngreat preferments with the very money which they have made believe must\r\nbring its possessor to perdition. And when they are taxed with these and\r\nmany other discreditable practices, they deem that there is no censure,\r\nhowever grave, of which they may not be quit by their glib formula:--'Follow\r\nour precepts, not our practice:' as if 'twere possible that the sheep should\r\nbe of a more austere and rigid virtue than the shepherds. And how many of\r\nthese, whom they put off with this formula, understand it not in the way in\r\nwhich they enunciate it, not a few of them know. The friars of to-day would\r\nhave you follow their precepts, that is to say, they would have you fill\r\ntheir purses with coin, confide to them your secrets, practise continence,\r\nbe longsuffering, forgive those that trespass against you, keep yourselves\r\nfrom evil speaking; all which things are good, seemly, holy. But to what\r\nend? To the end that they may be able to do that which, if the laity do it,\r\nthey will not be able to do. Who knows not that idleness cannot subsist\r\nwithout money? Spend thy money on thy pleasures, and the friar will not be\r\nable to live in sloth in his order. Go after women, and there will be no\r\nplace for the friar. Be not longsuffering, pardon not the wrong-doer, and\r\nthe friar will not dare to cross thy threshold to corrupt thy family. But\r\nwherefore pursue I the topic through every detail? They accuse themselves as\r\noften as they so excuse themselves in the hearing of all that have\r\nunderstanding. Why seclude they not themselves, if they misdoubt their power\r\nto lead continent and holy lives? Or if they must needs not live as\r\nrecluses, why follow they not that other holy text of the Gospel:--Christ\r\nbegan to do and to teach?(1) Let them practise first, and school us with\r\ntheir precepts afterwards. A thousand such have I seen in my day, admirers,\r\nlovers, philanderers, not of ladies of the world alone, but of nuns; ay, and\r\nthey too such as made the most noise in the pulpits. Is it such as they that\r\nwe are to follow? He that does so, pleases himself; but God knows if he do\r\nwisely. But assume that herein we must allow that your censor, the friar,\r\nspoke truth, to wit, that none may break the marriage-vow without very grave\r\nsin. What then? to rob a man, to slay him, to make of him an exile and a\r\nwanderer on the face of the earth, are not these yet greater sins? None will\r\ndeny that so they are. A woman that indulges herself in the intimate use\r\nwith a man commits but a sin of nature; but if she rob him, or slay him, or\r\ndrive him out into exile, her sin proceeds from depravity of spirit. That\r\nyou did rob Tedaldo, I have already shewn you, in that, having of your own\r\nfree will become his, you reft you from him. I now go further and say that,\r\nso far as in you lay, you slew him, seeing that, shewing yourself ever more\r\nand more cruel, you did your utmost to drive him to take his own life; and\r\nin the law's intent he that is the cause that wrong is done is as culpable\r\nas he that does it. Nor is it deniable that you were the cause that for\r\nseven years he has been an exile and a wanderer upon the face of the earth.\r\nWherefore upon each of the said three articles you are found guilty of a\r\ngreater crime than you committed by your intimacy with him. But consider we\r\nthe matter more closely: perchance Tedaldo merited such treatment: nay, but\r\nassuredly 'twas not so. You have yourself so confessed: besides which I know\r\nthat he loves you more dearly than himself. He would laud, he would extol,\r\nhe would magnify you above all other ladies so as never was heard the like,\r\nwheresoever 'twas seemly for him to speak of you, and it might be done\r\nwithout exciting suspicion. All his bliss, all his honour, all his liberty\r\nhe avowed was entirely in your disposal. Was he not of noble birth? And for\r\nbeauty might he not compare with the rest of his townsfolk? Did he not excel\r\nin all the exercises and accomplishments proper to youth? Was he not\r\nbeloved, held dear, well seen of all men? You will not deny it. How then\r\ncould you at the behest of a paltry friar, silly, brutish and envious, bring\r\nyourself to deal with him in any harsh sort? I cannot estimate the error of\r\nthose ladies who look askance on men and hold them cheap; whereas,\r\nbethinking them of what they are themselves, and what and how great is the\r\nnobility with which God has endowed man above all the other animals, they\r\nought rather to glory in the love which men give them, and hold them most\r\ndear, and with all zeal study to please them, that so their love may never\r\nfail. In what sort you did so, instigated by the chatter of a friar, some\r\nbroth-guzzling, pastry-gorging knave without a doubt, you know; and\r\nperadventure his purpose was but to instal himself in the place whence he\r\nsought to oust another. This then is the sin which the Divine justice,\r\nwhich, ever operative, suffers no perturbation of its even balance, or\r\narrest of judgment, has decreed not to leave unpunished: wherefore, as\r\nwithout due cause you devised how you might despoil Tedaldo of yourself, so\r\nwithout due cause your husband has been placed and is in jeopardy of his\r\nlife on Tedaldo's account, and to your sore affliction. Wherefrom if you\r\nwould be delivered, there is that which you must promise, ay, and (much\r\nmore) which you must perform: to wit, that, should it ever betide that\r\nTedaldo return hither from his long exile, you will restore to him your\r\nfavour, your love, your tender regard, your intimacy, and reinstate him in\r\nthe position which he held before you foolishly hearkened to the halfwitted\r\nfriar.\"\r\n\r\nThus ended the pilgrim; and the lady, who had followed him with the closest\r\nattention, deeming all that he advanced very sound, and doubting not that\r\nher tribulation was, as he said, in requital of her sin, spoke thus:--\r\n\"Friend of God, well I wot that the matters which you discourse are true,\r\nand, thanks to your delineation, I now in great measure know what manner of\r\nmen are the friars, whom I have hitherto regarded as all alike holy; nor\r\ndoubt I that great was my fault in the course which I pursued towards\r\nTedaldo; and gladly, were it in my power, would I make reparation in the\r\nmanner which you have indicated. But how is this feasible? Tedaldo can never\r\nreturn to us. He is dead. Wherefore I know not why I must needs give you a\r\npromise which cannot be performed.\" \"Madam,\" returned the pilgrim, \"'tis\r\nrevealed to me by God that Tedaldo is by no means dead, but alive and well\r\nand happy, so only he enjoyed your favour.\" \"Nay, but,\" said the lady,\r\n\"speak advisedly; I saw his body done to death by more than one knife-wound;\r\nI folded it in these arms, and drenched the dead face with many a tear;\r\nwhereby, perchance, I gave occasion for the bruit that has been made to my\r\ndisadvantage.\" \"Say what you may, Madam,\" rejoined the pilgrim,\" I assure\r\nyou that Tedaldo lives, and if you will but give the promise, then, for its\r\nfulfilment, I have good hope that you will soon see him.\" Whereupon: \"I give\r\nthe promise,\" said the lady, \"and right gladly will I make it good; nor is\r\nthere aught that might happen that would yield me such delight as to see my\r\nhusband free and scatheless, and Tedaldo alive.\" Tedaldo now deemed it wise\r\nto make himself known, and establish the lady in a more sure hope of her\r\nhusband's safety. Wherefore he said:--\"Madam, to set your mind at ease in\r\nregard of your husband, I must first impart to you a secret, which be\r\nmindful to disclose to none so long as you live.\" Then--for such was the\r\nconfidence which the lady reposed in the pilgrim's apparent sanctity that\r\nthey were by themselves in a place remote from observation--Tedaldo drew\r\nforth a ring which he had guarded with the most jealous care, since it had\r\nbeen given him by the lady on the last night when they were together, and\r\nsaid, as he shewed it to her:--\"Madam, know you this?\" The lady recognized\r\nit forthwith, and answered:--\"I do, Sir; I gave it long ago to Tedaldo.\"\r\nThen the pilgrim, rising and throwing off his sclavine(2) and hat, said with\r\nthe Florentine accent:--\"And know you me?\" The lady recognizing forthwith\r\nthe form and semblance of Tedaldo, was struck dumb with wonder and fear as\r\nof a corpse that is seen to go about as if alive, and was much rather\r\ndisposed to turn and flee from Tedaldo returned from the tomb than to come\r\nforward and welcome Tedaldo arrived from Cyprus. But when Tedaldo said to\r\nher:--\"Fear not, Madam, your Tedaldo am I, alive and well, nor was I ever\r\ndead, whatever you and my brothers may think,\" the lady, partly awed, partly\r\nreassured by his voice, regarded him with rather more attention, and inly\r\naffirming that 'twas in very truth Tedaldo, threw herself upon his neck, and\r\nwept, and kissed him, saying:--\"Sweet my Tedaldo, welcome home.\" \"Madam,\"\r\nreplied Tedaldo after he had kissed and embraced her, \"time serves not now\r\nfor greetings more intimate. 'Tis for me to be up and doing, that\r\nAldobrandino may be restored to you safe and sound; touching which matter\r\nyou will, I trust, before to-morrow at even hear tidings that will gladden\r\nyour heart; indeed I expect to have good news to-night, and, if so, will\r\ncome and tell it you, when I shall be less straitened than I am at present.\"\r\nHe then resumed his sclavine and hat, and having kissed the lady again, and\r\nbade her be of good cheer, took his leave, and hied him to the prison, where\r\nAldobrandino lay more occupied with apprehension of imminent death than hope\r\nof deliverance to come. As ministrant of consolation, he gained ready\r\nadmittance of the warders, and, seating himself by Aldobrandino's side, he\r\nsaid:--\"Aldobrandino, in me thou seest a friend sent thee by God, who is\r\ntouched with pity of thee by reason of thy innocence; wherefore, if in\r\nreverent submission to Him thou wilt grant me a slight favour that I shall\r\nask of thee, without fail, before to-morrow at even, thou shalt, in lieu of\r\nthe doom of death that thou awaitest, hear thy acquittal pronounced.\"\r\n\"Worthy man,\" replied Aldobrandino, \"I know thee not, nor mind I ever to\r\nhave seen thee; wherefore, as thou shewest thyself solicitous for my safety,\r\nmy friend indeed thou must needs be, even as thou sayst. And in sooth the\r\ncrime, for which they say I ought to be doomed to death, I never committed,\r\nthough others enough I have committed, which perchance have brought me to\r\nthis extremity. However, if so be that God has now pity on me, this I tell\r\nthee in reverent submission to Him, that, whereas 'tis but a little thing\r\nthat thou cravest of me, there is nought, however great, but I would not\r\nonly promise but gladly do it; wherefore, even ask what thou wilt, and, if\r\nso be that I escape, I will without fail keep my word to the letter.\" \"Nay,\"\r\nreturned the pilgrim, \"I ask but this of thee, that thou pardon Tedaldo's\r\nfour brothers, that in the belief that thou wast guilty of their brother's\r\ndeath they brought thee to this strait, and, so they ask thy forgiveness,\r\naccount them as thy brothers and friends.\" \"How sweet,\" replied\r\nAldobrandino, \"is the savour, how ardent the desire, of vengeance, none\r\nknows but he that is wronged; but yet, so God may take thought for my\r\ndeliverance, I will gladly pardon, nay, I do now pardon them, and if I go\r\nhence alive and free, I will thenceforth have them in such regard as shall\r\ncontent thee.\" Satisfied with this answer, the pilgrim, without further\r\nparley, heartily exhorted Aldobrandino to be of good cheer; assuring him\r\nthat, before the next day was done, he should be certified beyond all manner\r\nof doubt of his deliverance; and so he left him.\r\n\r\nOn quitting the prison the pilgrim hied him forthwith to the signory, and\r\nbeing closeted with a knight that was in charge, thus spoke:--\"My lord, 'tis\r\nthe duty of all, and most especially of those who hold your place, zealously\r\nto bestir themselves that the truth be brought to light, in order as well\r\nthat those bear not the penalty who have not committed the crime, as that\r\nthe guilty be punished. And that this may come to pass to your honour and\r\nthe undoing of the delinquent, I am come hither to you. You wot that you\r\nhave dealt rigorously with Aldobrandino Palermini, and have found, as you\r\nthink, that 'twas he that slew Tedaldo Elisei, and you are about to condemn\r\nhim; wherein you are most certainly in error, as I doubt not before midnight\r\nto prove to you, delivering the murderers into your hands.\" The worthy\r\nknight, who was not without pity for Aldobrandino, readily gave ear to the\r\npilgrim's words. He conversed at large with him, and availing himself of his\r\nguidance, made an easy capture of the two brothers that kept the inn and\r\ntheir servant in their first sleep. He was about to put them the torture, to\r\nelicit the true state of the case, when, their courage failing, they\r\nconfessed without the least reserve, severally at first, and then jointly,\r\nthat 'twas they that had slain Tedaldo Elisei, not knowing who he was. Asked\r\nfor why, they answered that 'twas because he had sorely harassed the wife of\r\none of them, and would have constrained her to do his pleasure, while they\r\nwere out of doors. Whereof the pilgrim was no sooner apprised, than by leave\r\nof the knight he withdrew, and hied him privily to the house of Madonna\r\nErmellina, whom (the rest of the household being gone to bed) he found\r\nawaiting him alone, and equally anxious for good news of her husband and a\r\ncomplete reconciliation with her Tedaldo. On entering, he blithely\r\nexclaimed:--\"Rejoice, dearest my lady, for thou mayst rest assured that\r\nto-morrow thou shalt have thy Aldobrandino back here safe and sound;\" and to\r\nconfirm her faith in his words, he told her all that he had done. Greater\r\njoy was never woman's than hers of two such glad surprises; to wit, to have\r\nTedaldo with her alive again, whom she had wailed for verily dead, and to\r\nknow Aldobrandino, whom she had thought in no long time to wail for dead,\r\nnow out of jeopardy. Wherefore, when she had affectionately embraced and\r\nkissed her Tedaldo, they hied them to bed together, and with hearty goodwill\r\nmade gracious and gladsome consummation of their peace by interchange of\r\nsweet solace.\r\n\r\nWith the approach of day Tedaldo rose, and having first apprised the lady of\r\nhis purpose and enjoined her, as before, to keep it most secret, resumed his\r\npilgrim's habit, and sallied forth of her house, to be ready, as occasion\r\nshould serve, to act in Aldobrandino's interest. As soon as 'twas day, the\r\nsignory, deeming themselves amply conversant with the affair, set\r\nAldobrandino at large; and a few days later they caused the malefactors to\r\nbe beheaded in the place where they had done the murder.\r\n\r\nGreat was Aldobrandino's joy to find himself free, not less great was that\r\nof his lady and all his friends and kinsfolk; and as 'twas through the\r\npilgrim that it had come about, they brought him to their house, there to\r\nreside as long as he cared to tarry in the city; nor could they do him\r\nhonour and cheer enough, and most of all the lady, who knew her man. But\r\nafter awhile, seeing that his brothers were not only become a common\r\nlaughing-stock by reason of Aldobrandino's acquittal, but had armed\r\nthemselves for very fear, he felt that their reconciliation with him brooked\r\nno delay, and accordingly craved of him performance of his promise.\r\nAldobrandino replied handsomely that it should be had at once. The pilgrim\r\nthen bade him arrange for the following day a grand banquet, at which he and\r\nhis kinsfolk and their ladies were to entertain the four brothers and their\r\nladies, adding that he would himself go forthwith as Aldobrandino's envoy,\r\nand bid them welcome to his peace and banquet. All which being approved by\r\nAldobrandino, the pilgrim hied him with all speed to the four brothers, whom\r\nby ample, apt and unanswerable argument he readily induced to reinstate\r\nthemselves in Aldobrandino's friendship by suing for his forgiveness: which\r\ndone, he bade them and their ladies to breakfast with Aldobrandino on the\r\nmorrow, and they, being assured of his good faith, were consenting to come.\r\nSo, on the morrow, at the breakfast hour, Tedaldo's four brothers, still\r\nwearing their black, came with certain of their friends to Aldobrandino's\r\nhouse, where he awaited them; and, in presence of the company that had been\r\nbidden to meet them, laid down their arms, and made surrender to\r\nAldobrandino, asking his pardon of that which they had done against him.\r\nAldobrandino received them compassionately, wept, kissed each on the mouth,\r\nand let few words suffice to remit each offence. After them came their\r\nsisters and their wives, all habited sadly, and were graciously received by\r\nMadonna Ermellina and the other ladies. The guests, men and women alike,\r\nfound all things ordered at the banquet with magnificence, nor aught unmeet\r\nfor commendation save the restraint which the yet recent grief, betokened by\r\nthe sombre garb of Tedaldo's kinsfolk, laid upon speech (wherein some had\r\nfound matter to except against the banquet and the pilgrim for devising it,\r\nas he well knew), but, as he had premeditated, in due time, he stood up, the\r\nothers being occupied with their dessert, and spoke thus:--\"Nothing is\r\nwanting to complete the gaiety of this banquet except the presence of\r\nTedaldo; whom, as you have been long time with him and have not known him, I\r\nwill point out to you.\" So, having divested himself of his sclavine and\r\nwhatever else in his garb denoted the pilgrim, he remained habited in a\r\ntunic of green taffeta, in which guise, so great was the wonder with which\r\nall regarded him that, though they recognized him, 'twas long before any\r\ndared to believe that 'twas actually Tedaldo. Marking their surprise,\r\nTedaldo told them not a little about themselves, their family connexions,\r\ntheir recent history, and his own adventures. Whereat his brothers and the\r\nrest of the men, all weeping for joy, hasted to embrace him, followed by the\r\nwomen, as well those that were not, as those that were, of kin to him, save\r\nonly Madonna Ermellina. Which Aldobrandino observing, said:--\"What is this,\r\nErmellina? How comes it that, unlike the other ladies, thou alone dost\r\nTedaldo no cheer?\" \"Cheer,\" replied the lady in the hearing of all, \"would I\r\ngladly do him such as no other woman has done or could do, seeing that I am\r\nmore beholden to him than any other woman, in that to him I owe it that I\r\nhave thee with me again; 'tis but the words spoken to my disadvantage, while\r\nwe mourned him that we deemed Tedaldo, that give me pause.\" \"Now out upon\r\nthee,\" said Aldobrandino, \"thinkest thou that I heed the yelping of these\r\ncurs? His zeal for my deliverance has abundantly disproved it, besides which\r\nI never believed it. Quick, get thee up, and go and embrace him.\" The lady,\r\nwho desired nothing better, was in this not slow to obey her husband; she\r\nrose forthwith, and embraced Tedaldo as the other ladies had done, and did\r\nhim gladsome cheer. Tedaldo's brothers and all the company, men and women\r\nalike, heartily approved Aldobrandino's handsomeness; and so whatever of\r\ndespite the rumour had engendered in the minds of any was done away. And,\r\nnow that all had done him cheer, Tedaldo with his own hands rent his\r\nbrothers' suits of black upon their backs, as also the sad-hued garments\r\nwhich his sisters and sisters-in-law wore, and bade bring other apparel.\r\nWhich when they had donned, there was no lack of singing, dancing and other\r\nsorts of merry-making; whereby the banquet, for all its subdued beginning,\r\nhad a sonorous close. Then, just as they were, in the blithest of spirits,\r\nthey hied them all to Tedaldo's house, where in the evening they supped; and\r\nin this manner they held festival for several days.\r\n\r\n'Twas some time before the Florentines ceased to look on Tedaldo as a\r\nportent, as if he were risen from the dead; and a shadow of doubt whether he\r\nwere really Tedaldo or no continued to lurk in the minds of not a few,\r\nincluding even his brothers: they had no assured belief; and in that frame\r\nhad perchance long continued, but for a casual occurrence that shewed them\r\nwho the murdered man was. It so befell that one day some men-at-arms from\r\nLunigiana passed by their house, and seeing Tedaldo accosted him, saying:--\r\n\"Good-morrow to thee, Faziuolo.\" To whom Tedaldo, in the presence of his\r\nbrothers, answered:--\"You take me for another.\" Whereat they were abashed,\r\nand asked his pardon, saying:--\"Sooth to tell, you are liker than we ever\r\nknew any man like to another to a comrade of ours, Faziuolo da Pontremoli by\r\nname, who came hither a fortnight ago, or perhaps a little more, since when\r\nwe have not been able to learn what became of him. Most true it is that your\r\ndress surprised us, because he, like ourselves, was a soldier.\" Whereupon\r\nTedaldo's eldest brother came forward, and asked how their comrade had been\r\naccoutred. They told him, and 'twas found to have been exactly as they said:\r\nby which and other evidence 'twas established that 'twas Faziuolo that had\r\nbeen murdered, and not Tedaldo; of whom thenceforth no suspicion lurked in\r\nthe minds of his brothers or any one else.\r\n\r\nSo, then, Tedaldo returned home very rich, and remained constant in his\r\nlove; nor did the lady again treat him harshly; but, using discretion, they\r\nlong had mutual solace of their love. God grant us solace of ours.\r\n\r\n(1) As pointed out by Mr. Payne, these words are not from any of the\r\nGospels, but from the first verse of the Acts of the Apostles.

My story then is of one that, living, was buried for dead,\r\nand after believed with many others that he came out of the tomb not as one\r\nthat had not died but as one risen from the dead; whereby he was venerated\r\nas a saint who ought rather to have been condemned as a criminal.\"\r\n\r\nKnow then that there was and still is in Tuscany an abbey, situate, as we\r\nsee not a few, in a somewhat solitary spot, wherein the office of abbot was\r\nheld by a monk, who in all other matters ordered his life with great\r\nsanctity, save only in the commerce with women, and therein knew so well how\r\nto cloak his indulgence, that scarce any there were that so much as\r\nsuspected--not to say detected it--so holy and just was he reputed in all\r\nmatters. Now the abbot consorted much with a very wealthy contadino, Ferondo\r\nby name, a man coarse and gross beyond measure, whose friendship the abbot\r\nonly cared for because of the opportunities which it afforded of deriving\r\namusement from his simplicity; and during their intercourse the abbot\r\ndiscovered that Ferondo had a most beautiful wife of whom he became so hotly\r\nenamoured that he could think of nought else either by day or by night. But\r\nlearning that, however simple and inept in all other matters, Ferondo shewed\r\nexcellent good sense in cherishing and watching over this wife of his, he\r\nalmost despaired. However, being very astute, he prevailed so far with\r\nFerondo, that he would sometimes bring his wife with him to take a little\r\nrecreation in the abbey-garden, where he discoursed to them with all\r\nlowliness of the blessedness of life eternal, and the most pious works of\r\nmany men and women of times past, insomuch that the lady conceived a desire\r\nto confess to him, and craved and had Ferondo's leave therefor. So, to the\r\nabbot's boundless delight, the lady came and seated herself at his feet to\r\nmake her confession, whereto she prefixed the following exordium:--\"If God,\r\nSir, had given me a husband, or had not permitted me to have one, perchance\r\n'twould be easy for me, under your guidance, to enter the way, of which you\r\nhave spoken, that leads to life eternal. But, considering what manner of man\r\nFerondo is, and his stupidity, I may call myself a widow, while yet I am\r\nmarried in that, so long as he lives, I may have no other husband; and he,\r\nfool that he is, is without the least cause so inordinately jealous of me\r\nthat 'tis not possible but that my life with him be one of perpetual\r\ntribulation and woe. Wherefore before I address myself to make further\r\nconfession, I in all humility beseech you to be pleased to give me some\r\ncounsel of this matter, for here or nowhere is to be found the source of the\r\namelioration of my life, and if it be not found, neither confession nor any\r\nother good work will be of any avail.\" The abbot was overjoyed to hear her\r\nthus speak, deeming that Fortune had opened a way to the fulfilment of his\r\nhearts desire. Wherefore he said:--\"My daughter, I doubt not that 'tis a\r\ngreat affliction to a lady, fair and delicate as you are, to have a fool for\r\na husband, and still more so he should be jealous: and as your husband is\r\nboth the one and the other, I readily credit what you say of your\r\ntribulation. But, to come to the point, I see no resource or remedy in this\r\ncase, save this only, that Ferondo be cured of his jealousy. The medicine\r\nthat shall cure him I know very well how to devise, but it behoves you to\r\nkeep secret what I am about to tell you.\" \"Doubt not of it, my father,\" said\r\nthe lady; \"for I had rather suffer death than tell any aught that you\r\nforbade me to tell. But the medicine, how is it to be devised?\" \"If we would\r\nhave him cured,\" replied the abbot, \"it can only be by his going to\r\npurgatory.\" \"And how may that be?\" returned the lady; \"can he go thither\r\nwhile he yet lives?\" \"He must die,\" answered the abbot; \"and so he will go\r\nthither; and when he has suffered pain enough to be cured of his jealousy,\r\nwe have certain prayers with which we will supplicate God to restore him to\r\nlife, and He will do so.\" \"Then,\" said the lady; \"am I to remain a widow?\"\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the abbot, \"for a certain time, during which you must be very\r\ncareful not to let yourself be married to another, because 'twould offend\r\nGod, and when Ferondo was restored to life, you would have to go back to\r\nhim, and he would be more jealous than ever.\" \"Be it so then,\" said the\r\nlady; \"if he be but cured of his jealousy, and so I be not doomed to pass\r\nthe rest of my days in prison, I shall be content: do as you think best.\"\r\n\"And so will I,\" said the abbot; \"but what reward shall I have for such a\r\nservice?\" \"My father,\" said the lady, \"what you please; so only it be in my\r\npower. But what may the like of me do that may be acceptable to a man such\r\nas you?\" \"Madam,\" replied the abbot, \"'tis in your power to do no less for\r\nme than I am about to do for you: as that which I am minded to do will\r\nensure your comfort and consolation, so there is that which you may do which\r\nwill be the deliverance and salvation of my life.\" \"If so it be,\" said the\r\nlady, \"I shall not be found wanting.\" \"In that case,\" said the abbot, \"you\r\nwill give me your love, and gratify my passion for you, with which I am all\r\nafire and wasting away.\" Whereto the lady, all consternation, replied:--\r\n\"Alas! my father, what is this you crave? I took you for a holy man; now\r\ndoes it beseem holy men to make such overtures to ladies that come to them\r\nfor counsel?\" \"Marvel not, fair my soul,\" returned the abbot; \"hereby is my\r\nholiness in no wise diminished, for holiness resides in the soul, and this\r\nwhich I ask of you is but a sin of the flesh. But, however it may be, such\r\nis the might of your bewitching beauty, that love constrains me thus to act.\r\nAnd, let me tell you, good cause have you to vaunt you of your beauty more\r\nthan other women, in that it delights the saints, who are used to\r\ncontemplate celestial beauties; whereto I may add that, albeit I am an\r\nabbot, yet I am a man even as others, and, as you see, not yet old. Nor need\r\nthis matter seem formidable to you, but rather to be anticipated with\r\npleasure, for, while Ferondo is in purgatory, I shall be your nightly\r\ncompanion, and will give you such solace as he should have given you; nor\r\nwill it ever be discovered by any, for all think of me even as you did a\r\nwhile ago, or even more so. Reject not the grace that God accords you; for\r\n'tis in your power to have, and, if you are wise and follow my advice, you\r\nshall have that which women not a few desire in vain to have. And moreover I\r\nhave jewels fair and rare, which I am minded shall be yours and none\r\nother's. Wherefore, sweet my hope, deny me not due guerdon of the service\r\nwhich I gladly render you.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady, her eyes still downcast, knew not how to deny him, and yet\r\nscrupled to gratify him: wherefore the abbot, seeing that she had hearkened\r\nand hesitated to answer, deemed that she was already half won, and following\r\nup what he had said with much more to the like effect, did not rest until he\r\nhad persuaded her that she would do well to comply: and so with some\r\nconfusion she told him that she was ready to obey his every behest; but it\r\nmight not be until Ferondo was in purgatory. The abbot, well content,\r\nreplied:--\"And we will send him thither forthwith: do but arrange that he\r\ncome hither to stay with me to-morrow or the day after.\" Which said, he\r\nslipped a most beautiful ring on her finger, and dismissed her. Pleased with\r\nthe gift, and expecting more to come, the lady rejoined her attendants, with\r\nwhom she forthwith fell a talking marvellous things of the abbot's sanctity,\r\nand so went home with them.\r\n\r\nSome few days after, Ferondo being come to the abbey, the abbot no sooner\r\nsaw him than he resolved to send him to purgatory. So he selected from among\r\nhis drugs a powder of marvellous virtue, which he had gotten in the Levant\r\nfrom a great prince, who averred that 'twas wont to be used by the Old Man\r\nof the Mountain, when he would send any one to or bring him from his\r\nparadise, and that, without doing the recipient any harm, 'twould induce in\r\nhim, according to the quantity of the dose, a sleep of such duration and\r\nquality that, while the efficacy of the powder lasted, none would deem him\r\nto be alive.(1) Whereof he took enough to cause a three days' sleep, and\r\ngave it to Ferondo in his cell in a beaker that had still some wine in it,\r\nso that he drank it unwittingly: after which he took Ferondo to the\r\ncloister, and there with some of his monks fell to making merry with him and\r\nhis ineptitudes. In no long time, however, the powder so wrought, that\r\nFerondo was seized in the head with a fit of somnolence so sudden and\r\nviolent that he slept as he stood, and sleeping fell to the ground. The\r\nabbot put on an agitated air, caused him to be untrussed, sent for cold\r\nwater, and had it sprinkled on his face, and applied such other remedies as\r\nif he would fain call back life and sense banished by vapours of the\r\nstomach, or some other intrusive force; but, as, for all that he and his\r\nmonks did, Ferondo did not revive, they, after feeling his pulse and finding\r\nthere no sign of life, one and all pronounced him certainly dead. Wherefore\r\nthey sent word to his wife and kinsfolk, who came forthwith, and mourned a\r\nwhile; after which Ferondo in his clothes was by the abbot's order laid in a\r\ntomb. The lady went home, saying that nothing should ever part her from a\r\nlittle son that she had borne Ferondo; and so she occupied herself with the\r\ncare of her son and Ferondo's estate. At night the abbot rose noiselessly,\r\nand with the help of a Bolognese monk, in whom he reposed much trust, and\r\nwho was that very day arrived from Bologna, got Ferondo out of the tomb, and\r\nbore him to a vault, which admitted no light, having been made to serve as a\r\nprison for delinquent monks; and having stripped him of his clothes, and\r\nhabited him as a monk, they laid him on a truss of straw, and left him there\r\nuntil he should revive. Expecting which event, and instructed by the abbot\r\nhow he was then to act, the Bolognese monk (none else knowing aught of what\r\nwas afoot) kept watch by the tomb.\r\n\r\nThe day after, the abbot with some of his monks paid a pastoral visit to the\r\nlady's house, where he found her in mourning weeds and sad at heart; and,\r\nafter administering a little consolation, he gently asked her to redeem her\r\npromise. Free as she now felt herself, and hampered neither by Ferondo nor\r\nby any other, the lady, who had noticed another beautiful ring on the\r\nabbot's finger, promised immediate compliance, and arranged with the abbot\r\nthat he should visit her the very next night. So, at nightfall, the abbot\r\ndonned Ferondo's clothes, and, attended by his monk, paid his visit, and lay\r\nwith her until matins to his immense delight and solace, and so returned to\r\nthe abbey; and many visits he paid her on the same errand; whereby some that\r\nmet him, coming or going that way, supposed that 'twas Ferondo perambulating\r\nthose parts by way of penance; and fables not a few passed from mouth to\r\nmouth of the foolish rustics, and sometimes reached the ears of the lady,\r\nwho was at no loss to account for them.\r\n\r\nAs for Ferondo, when he revived, 'twas only to find himself he knew not\r\nwhere, while the Bolognese monk entered the tomb, gibbering horribly, and\r\narmed with a rod, wherewith, having laid hold of Ferondo, he gave him a\r\nsevere thrashing. Blubbering and bellowing for pain, Ferondo could only\r\nejaculate:--\"Where am I?\" \"In purgatory,\" replied the monk. \"How?\" returned\r\nFerondo, \"am I dead then?\" and the monk assuring him that 'twas even so, he\r\nfell a bewailing his own and his lady's and his son's fate, after the most\r\nridiculous fashion in the world. The monk brought him somewhat to eat and\r\ndrink. Of which when Ferondo caught sight, \"Oh!\" said he, \"dead folk eat\r\nthen, do they?\" \"They do,\" replied the monk, \"And this, which I bring thee,\r\nis what the lady that was thy wife sent this morning to the church by way of\r\nalms for masses for thy soul; and God is minded that it be assigned to\r\nthee.\" \"Now God grant her a happy year,\" said Ferondo; \"dearly I loved her\r\nwhile I yet lived, and would hold her all night long in my arms, and cease\r\nnot to kiss her, ay, and would do yet more to her, when I was so minded.\"\r\nWhereupon he fell to eating and drinking with great avidity, and finding the\r\nwine not much to his taste, he said:--\"Now God do her a mischief! Why gave\r\nshe not the priest of the wine that is in the cask by the wall?\" When he had\r\ndone eating, the monk laid hold of him again, and gave him another sound\r\nthrashing with the rod. Ferondo bellowed mightily, and then cried out:--\r\n\"Alas! why servest thou me so?\" \"God,\" answered the monk, \"has decreed that\r\nthou be so served twice a day.\" \"For why?\" said Ferondo. \"Because,\" returned\r\nthe monk, \"thou wast jealous, notwithstanding thou hadst to wife a woman\r\nthat has not her peer in thy countryside.\" \"Alas,\" said Ferondo, \"she was\r\nindeed all that thou sayst, ay, and the sweetest creature too,--no comfit so\r\nhoneyed--but I knew not that God took it amiss that a man should be jealous,\r\nor I had not been so.\" \"Of that,\" replied the monk, \"thou shouldst have\r\nbethought thee while thou wast there, and have amended thy ways; and should\r\nit fall to thy lot ever to return thither, be sure that thou so lay to heart\r\nthe lesson that I now give thee, that thou be no more jealous.\" \"Oh!\" said\r\nFerondo; \"dead folk sometimes return to earth, do they?\" \"They do,\" replied\r\nthe monk; \"if God so will.\" \"Oh!\" said Ferondo; \"if I ever return, I will be\r\nthe best husband in the world; never will I beat her or scold her, save for\r\nthe wine that she has sent me this morning, and also for sending me never a\r\ncandle, so that I have had perforce to eat in the dark.\" \"Nay,\" said the\r\nmonk, \"she sent them, but they were burned at the masses.\" \"Oh!\" said\r\nFerondo, \"I doubt not you say true; and, of a surety, if I ever return, I\r\nwill let her do just as she likes. But tell me, who art thou that entreatest\r\nme thus?\" \"Late of Sardinia I,\" answered the monk, \"dead too; and, for that\r\nI gave my lord much countenance in his jealousy, doomed by God for my proper\r\npenance to entreat thee thus with food and drink and thrashings, until such\r\ntime as He may ordain otherwise touching thee and me.\" \"And are we two the\r\nonly folk here?\" inquired Ferondo. \"Nay, there are thousands beside,\"\r\nanswered the monk; \"but thou canst neither see nor hear them, nor they\r\nthee.\" \"And how far,\" said Ferondo, \"may we be from our country?\" \"Oh! ho!\"\r\nreturned the monk, \"why, 'tis some miles clean out of shitrange.\" \"I'faith,\"\r\nsaid Ferondo, \"that is far indeed: methinks we must be out of the world.\"\r\n\r\nIn such a course, alternately beaten, fed and amused with idle tales, was\r\nFerondo kept for ten months, while the abbot, to his great felicity, paid\r\nmany a visit to the fair lady, and had the jolliest time in the world with\r\nher. But, as misfortunes will happen, the lady conceived, which fact, as\r\nsoon as she was aware of it, she imparted to the abbot; whereupon both\r\nagreed that Ferondo must without delay be brought back from purgatory to\r\nearth and her, and be given to understand that she was with child of him. So\r\nthe very next night the abbot went to the prison, and in a disguised voice\r\npronounced Ferondo's name, and said to him:--\"Ferondo, be of good cheer, for\r\nGod is minded that thou return to earth; and on thy return thou shalt have a\r\nson by thy lady, and thou shalt call him Benedetto; because 'tis in answer\r\nto the prayers of thy holy abbot and thy lady, and for love of St. Benedict,\r\nthat God accords thee this grace.\" Whereat Ferondo was overjoyed, and said:-\r\n-\"It likes me well. God give a good year to Master Lord God, and the abbot,\r\nand St. Benedict, and my cheese-powdered, honey-sweet wife.\" Then, in the\r\nwine that he sent him, the abbot administered enough of the powder to cause\r\nhim to sleep for four hours; and so, with the aid of the monk, having first\r\nhabited him in his proper clothes, he privily conveyed him back to the tomb\r\nin which he had been buried. On the morrow at daybreak Ferondo revived, and\r\nperceiving through a chink in the tomb a glimmer of light, to which he had\r\nbeen a stranger for full ten months, he knew that he was alive, and began to\r\nbellow:--\"Let me out, let me out:\" then, setting his head to the lid of the\r\ntomb, he heaved amain; whereby the lid, being insecure, started; and he was\r\nalready thrusting it aside, when the monks, matins being now ended, ran to\r\nthe spot and recognized Ferondo's voice, and saw him issue from the tomb; by\r\nwhich unwonted event they were all so affrighted that they took to flight,\r\nand hied them to the abbot: who, rising as if from prayer, said:--\"Sons, be\r\nnot afraid; take the cross and the holy water, and follow me, and let us see\r\nwhat sign of His might God will vouchsafe us.\" And so he led the way to the\r\ntomb; beside which they found Ferondo, standing, deathly pale by reason of\r\nhis long estrangement from the light. On sight of the abbot he ran and threw\r\nhimself at his feet, saying:--\"My father, it has been revealed to me that\r\n'tis to your prayers and those of St. Benedict and my lady that I owe my\r\nrelease from purgatorial pain, and restoration to life; wherefore 'tis my\r\nprayer that God give you a good year and good calends, to-day and all days.\"\r\n\"Laud we the power of God!\" said the abbot. \"Go then, son, as God has\r\nrestored thee to earth, comfort thy wife, who, since thou didst depart this\r\nlife, has been ever in tears, and mayst thou live henceforth in the love and\r\nservice of God.\" \"Sir,\" answered Ferondo, \"'tis well said; and, for the\r\ndoing, trust me that, as soon as I find her, I shall kiss her, such is the\r\nlove I bear her.\" So saying, he went his way; and the abbot, left alone with\r\nhis monks, made as if he marvelled greatly at the affair, and caused\r\ndevoutly chant the Miserere. So Ferondo returned to his hamlet, where all\r\nthat saw him fleeing, as folk are wont to flee from spectacles of horror, he\r\ncalled them back, asseverating that he was risen from the tomb. His wife at\r\nfirst was no less timorous: but, as folk began to take heart of grace,\r\nperceiving that he was alive, they plied him with many questions, all which\r\nhe answered as one that had returned with ripe experience, and gave them\r\ntidings of the souls of their kinsfolk, and told of his own invention the\r\nprettiest fables of the purgatorial state, and in full folkmoot recounted\r\nthe revelation vouchsafed him by the mouth of Ragnolo Braghiello(2) before\r\nhis resuscitation.\r\n\r\nThus was Ferondo reinstated in his property and reunited to his wife, who,\r\nbeing pregnant, as he thought, by himself, chanced by the time of her\r\ndelivery to countenance the vulgar error that the woman must bear the infant\r\nin the womb for exactly nine months, and gave birth to a male child, who was\r\nnamed Benedetto Ferondi. Ferondo's return from purgatory, and the report he\r\nbrought thence, immeasurably enhanced the fame of the abbot's holiness. So\r\nFerondo, cured of his jealousy by the thrashings which he had gotten for it,\r\nverified the abbot's prediction, and never offended the lady again in that\r\nsort. Wherefore she lived with him, as before, in all outward seemliness;\r\nalbeit she failed not, as occasion served, to forgather with the holy abbot,\r\nwho had so well and sedulously served her in her especial need.\r\n\r\n(1) By the Old Man of the Mountain is meant the head of the confraternity of\r\nhashish-eaters (Assassins), whose chief stronghold was at Alamut in Persia\r\n(1090-1256).

Wherefore without\r\nawaiting the call of her subjects, thus with mien most gracious she began:--\r\nNow that we have heard Lauretta's story, who shall tell any to compare with\r\nit for beauty? Lucky indeed was it that she was not the first; for few that\r\nfollowed would have pleased; and so, I misdoubt me, 'twill fare ill with\r\nthose that remain to complete the day's narration. However, for what it may\r\nbe worth, I will tell you a story which seems to me germane to our theme.\r\n\r\nKnow, then, that in the realm of France there was a gentleman, Isnard, Comte\r\nde Roussillon, by name, who, being in ill-health, kept ever in attendance on\r\nhim a physician, one Master Gerard of Narbonne. The said Count had an only\r\nson named Bertrand, a very fine and winsome little lad; with whom were\r\nbrought up other children of his own age, among them the said physician's\r\nlittle daughter Gillette; who with a love boundless and ardent out of all\r\nkeeping with her tender years became enamoured of this Bertrand. And so,\r\nwhen the Count died, and his son, being left a ward of the King, must needs\r\ngo to Paris, the girl remained beside herself with grief, and, her father\r\ndying soon after, would gladly have gone to Paris to see Bertrand, might she\r\nbut have found a fair excuse; but no decent pretext could she come by, being\r\nleft a great and sole heiress and very closely guarded. So being come of\r\nmarriageable age, still cherishing Bertrand's memory, she rejected not a few\r\nsuitors, to whom her kinsfolk would fain have married her, without assigning\r\nany reason.\r\n\r\nNow her passion waxing ever more ardent for Bertrand, as she learned that he\r\nwas grown a most goodly gallant, tidings reached her that the King of\r\nFrance, in consequence of a tumour which he had had in the breast, and which\r\nhad been ill tended, was now troubled with a fistula, which occasioned him\r\nextreme distress and suffering; nor had he as yet come by a physician that\r\nwas able, though many had essayed, to cure him, but had rather grown worse\r\nunder their hands; wherefore in despair he was minded no more to have\r\nrecourse to any for counsel or aid. Whereat the damsel was overjoyed,\r\ndeeming not only that she might find therein lawful occasion to go to Paris,\r\nbut, that, if the disease was what she took it to be, it might well betide\r\nthat she should be wedded to Bertrand. So--for not a little knowledge had\r\nshe gotten from her father--she prepared a powder from certain herbs\r\nserviceable in the treatment of the supposed disease, and straightway took\r\nhorse, and hied her to Paris. Arrived there she made it her first concern to\r\nhave sight of Bertrand; and then, having obtained access to the King, she\r\nbesought him of his grace to shew her his disease. The King knew not how to\r\nrefuse so young, fair and winsome a damsel, and let her see the place.\r\nWhereupon, no longer doubting that she should cure him, she said:--\"Sire, so\r\nplease you, I hope in God to cure you of this malady within eight days\r\nwithout causing you the least distress or discomfort.\" The King inly scoffed\r\nat her words, saying to himself:--\"How should a damsel have come by a\r\nknowledge and skill that the greatest physicians in the world do not\r\npossess?\" He therefore graciously acknowledged her good intention, and\r\nanswered that he had resolved no more to follow advice of physician. \"Sire,\"\r\nsaid the damsel, \"you disdain my art, because I am young and a woman; but I\r\nbid you bear in mind that I rely not on my own skill, but on the help of\r\nGod, and the skill of Master Gerard of Narbonne, my father, and a famous\r\nphysician in his day.\" Whereupon the King said to himself:--\"Perchance she\r\nis sent me by God; why put I not her skill to the proof, seeing that she\r\nsays that she can cure me in a short time, and cause me no distress?\" And\r\nbeing minded to make the experiment, he said:--\"Damsel, and if, having\r\ncaused me to cancel my resolve, you should fail to cure me, what are you\r\ncontent should ensue?\" \"Sire,\" answered the damsel, \"set a guard upon me;\r\nand if within eight days I cure you not, have me burned; but if I cure you,\r\nwhat shall be my guerdon?\" \"You seem,\" said the King, \"to be yet unmarried;\r\nif you shall effect the cure, we will marry you well and in high place.\"\r\n\"Sire,\" returned the damsel, \"well content indeed am I that you should marry\r\nme, so it be to such a husband as I shall ask of you, save that I may not\r\nask any of your sons or any other member of the royal house.\" Whereto the\r\nKing forthwith consented, and the damsel, thereupon applying her treatment,\r\nrestored him to health before the period assigned. Wherefore, as soon as the\r\nKing knew that he was cured:--\"Damsel,\" said he, \"well have you won your\r\nhusband.\" She, answered:--\"In that case, Sire, I have won Bertrand de\r\nRoussillon, of whom, while yet a child, I was enamoured, and whom I have\r\never since most ardently loved.\" To give her Bertrand seemed to the King no\r\nsmall matter; but, having pledged his word, he would not break it: so he\r\nsent for Bertrand, and said to him:--\"Bertrand, you are now come to man's\r\nestate, and fully equipped to enter on it; 'tis therefore our will that you\r\ngo back and assume the governance of your county, and that you take with you\r\na damsel, whom we have given you to wife.\" \"And who is the damsel, Sire?\"\r\nsaid Bertrand. \"She it is,\" answered the King, \"that has restored us to\r\nhealth by her physic.\" Now Bertrand, knowing Gillette, and that her lineage\r\nwas not such as matched his nobility, albeit, seeing her, he had found her\r\nvery fair, was overcome with disdain, and answered:--\"So, Sire, you would\r\nfain give me a she-doctor to wife. Now God forbid that I should ever marry\r\nany such woman.\" \"Then,\" said the King, \"you would have us fail of the faith\r\nwhich we pledged to the damsel, who asked you in marriage by way of guerdon\r\nfor our restoration to health.\" \"Sire,\" said Bertrand, \"you may take from me\r\nall that I possess, and give me as your man to whomsoever you may be minded;\r\nbut rest assured that I shall never be satisfied with such a match.\" \"Nay,\r\nbut you will,\" replied the King; \"for the damsel is fair and discreet, and\r\nloves you well; wherefore we anticipate that you will live far more happily\r\nwith her than with a dame of much higher lineage.\" Bertrand was silent; and\r\nthe King made great preparations for the celebration of the nuptials. The\r\nappointed day came, and Bertrand, albeit reluctantly, nevertheless complied,\r\nand in the presence of the King was wedded to the damsel, who loved him more\r\ndearly than herself. Which done, Bertrand, who had already taken his\r\nresolution, said that he was minded to go down to his county, there to\r\nconsummate the marriage; and so, having craved and had leave of absence of\r\nthe King, he took horse, but instead of returning to his county he hied him\r\nto Tuscany; where, finding the Florentines at war with the Sienese, he\r\ndetermined to take service with the Florentines, and being made heartily and\r\nhonourably welcome, was appointed to the command of part of their forces, at\r\na liberal stipend, and so remained in their service for a long while.\r\nDistressed by this turn of fortune, and hoping by her wise management to\r\nbring Bertrand back to his county, the bride hied her to Roussillon, where\r\nshe was received by all the tenants as their liege lady. She found that,\r\nduring the long absence of the lord, everything had fallen into decay and\r\ndisorder; which, being a capable woman, she rectified with great and\r\nsedulous care, to the great joy of the tenants, who held her in great esteem\r\nand love, and severely censured the Count, that he was not satisfied with\r\nher. When the lady had duly ordered all things in the county, she despatched\r\ntwo knights to the Count with the intelligence, praying him, that, if 'twas\r\non her account that he came not home, he would so inform her; in which case\r\nshe would gratify him by departing. To whom with all harshness he\r\nreplied:--\"She may even please herself in the matter. For my part I will go\r\nhome and live with her, when she has this ring on her finger and a son\r\ngotten of me upon her arm.\" The ring was one which he greatly prized, and\r\nnever removed from his finger, by reason of a virtue which he had been given\r\nto understand that it possessed. The knights appreciated the harshness of a\r\ncondition which contained two articles, both of which were all but\r\nimpossible; and, seeing that by no words of theirs could they alter his\r\nresolve, they returned to the lady, and delivered his message. Sorely\r\ndistressed, the lady after long pondering determined to try how and where\r\nthe two conditions might be satisfied, that so her husband might be hers\r\nagain. Having formed her plan, she assembled certain of the more\r\nconsiderable and notable men of the county, to whom she gave a consecutive\r\nand most touching narrative of all that she had done for love of the Count,\r\nwith the result; concluding by saying that she was not minded to tarry there\r\nto the Count's perpetual exile, but to pass the rest of her days in\r\npilgrimages and pious works for the good of her soul: wherefore she prayed\r\nthem to undertake the defence and governance of the county, and to inform\r\nthe Count that she had made entire and absolute cession of it to him, and\r\nwas gone away with the intention of never more returning to Roussillon. As\r\nshe spoke, tears not a few coursed down the cheeks of the honest men, and\r\nagain and again they besought her to change her mind, and stay. All in vain,\r\nhowever; she commended them to God, and, accompanied only by one of her male\r\ncousins and a chambermaid (all three habited as pilgrims and amply provided\r\nwith money and precious jewels), she took the road, nor tarried until she\r\nwas arrived at Florence. There she lodged in a little inn kept by a good\r\nwoman that was a widow, bearing herself lowly as a poor pilgrim, and eagerly\r\nexpectant of news of her lord.\r\n\r\nNow it so befell that the very next day she saw Bertrand pass in front of\r\nthe inn on horseback at the head of his company; and though she knew him\r\nvery well, nevertheless she asked the good woman of the inn who he was. The\r\nhostess replied:--\"'Tis a foreign gentleman--Count Bertrand they call him--a\r\nvery pleasant gentleman, and courteous, and much beloved in this city; and\r\nhe is in the last degree enamoured of one of our neighbours here, who is a\r\ngentlewoman, but in poor circumstances. A very virtuous damsel she is too,\r\nand, being as yet unmarried by reason of her poverty, she lives with her\r\nmother, who is an excellent and most discreet lady, but for whom, perchance,\r\nshe would before now have yielded and gratified the Count's desire.\" No word\r\nof this was lost on the lady; she pondered and meditated every detail with\r\nthe closest attention, and having laid it all to heart, took her resolution:\r\nshe ascertained the names and abode of the lady and her daughter that the\r\nCount loved, and hied her one day privily, wearing her pilgrim's weeds, to\r\ntheir house, where she found the lady and her daughter in very evident\r\npoverty, and after greeting them, told the lady that, if it were agreeable\r\nto her, she would speak with her. The gentlewoman rose and signified her\r\nwillingness to listen to what she had to say; so they went into a room by\r\nthemselves and sate down, and then the Countess began thus:--\"Madam,\r\nmethinks you are, as I am, under Fortune's frown; but perchance you have it\r\nin your power, if you are so minded, to afford solace to both of us.\" The\r\nlady answered that, so she might honourably find it, solace indeed was what\r\nshe craved most of all things in the world. Whereupon the Countess\r\ncontinued:--\"I must first be assured of your faith, wherein if I confide and\r\nam deceived, the interests of both of us will suffer.\" \"Have no fear,\" said\r\nthe gentlewoman, \"speak your whole mind without reserve, for you will find\r\nthat there is no deceit in me.\" So the Countess told who she was, and the\r\nwhole course of her love affair, from its commencement to that hour, on such\r\nwise that the gentlewoman, believing her story the more readily that she had\r\nalready heard it in part from others, was touched with compassion for her.\r\nThe narrative of her woes complete, the Countess added:--\"Now that you have\r\nheard my misfortunes, you know the two conditions that I must fulfil, if I\r\nwould come by my husband; nor know I any other person than you, that may\r\nenable me to fulfil them; but so you may, if this which I hear is true, to\r\nwit, that my husband is in the last degree enamoured of your daughter.\"\r\n\"Madam,\" replied the gentlewoman, \"I know not if the Count loves my\r\ndaughter, but true it is that he makes great shew of loving her; but how may\r\nthis enable me to do aught for you in the matter that you have at heart?\"\r\n\"The how, madam,\" returned the Countess, \"I will shortly explain to you; but\r\nyou shall first hear what I intend shall ensue, if you serve me. Your\r\ndaughter, I see, is fair and of marriageable age, and, by what I have\r\nlearned and may well understand, 'tis because you have not the wherewith to\r\nmarry her that you keep her at home. Now, in recompense of the service that\r\nyou shall do me, I mean to provide her forthwith from my own moneys with\r\nsuch a dowry as you yourself shall deem adequate for her marriage.\" The lady\r\nwas too needy not to be gratified by the proposal; but, nevertheless, with\r\nthe true spirit of the gentlewoman, she answered:--\"Nay but, madam, tell me\r\nthat which I may do for you, and if it shall be such as I may honourably do,\r\ngladly will I do it, and then you shall do as you may be minded.\" Said then\r\nthe Countess:--\"I require of you, that through some one in whom you trust\r\nyou send word to the Count, my husband, that your daughter is ready to yield\r\nherself entirely to his will, so she may be sure that he loves her even as\r\nhe professes; whereof she will never be convinced, until he send her the\r\nring which he wears on his finger, and which, she understands, he prizes so\r\nmuch: which, being sent, you shall give to me, and shall then send him word\r\nthat your daughter is ready to do his pleasure, and, having brought him\r\nhither secretly, you shall contrive that I lie by his side instead of your\r\ndaughter. Perchance, by God's grace I shall conceive, and so, having his\r\nring on my finger, and a son gotten of him on my arm, shall have him for my\r\nown again, and live with him even as a wife should live with her husband,\r\nand owe it all to you.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady felt that 'twas not a little that the Countess craved of her, for\r\nshe feared lest it should bring reproach upon her daughter: but she\r\nreflected that to aid the good lady to recover her husband was an honourable\r\nenterprise, and that in undertaking it she would be subserving a like end;\r\nand so, trusting in the good and virtuous disposition of the Countess, she\r\nnot only promised to do as she was required, but in no long time, proceeding\r\nwith caution and secrecy, as she had been bidden, she both had the ring from\r\nthe Count, loath though he was to part with it, and cunningly contrived that\r\nthe Countess should lie with him in place of her daughter. In which first\r\ncommingling, so ardently sought by the Count, it so pleased God that the\r\nlady was gotten, as in due time her delivery made manifest, with two sons.\r\nNor once only, but many times did the lady gratify the Countess with the\r\nembraces of her husband, using such secrecy that no word thereof ever got\r\nwind, the Count all the while supposing that he lay, not with his wife, but\r\nwith her that he loved, and being wont to give her, as he left her in the\r\nmorning, some fair and rare jewel, which she jealously guarded.\r\n\r\nWhen she perceived that she was with child, the Countess, being minded no\r\nmore to burden the lady with such service, said to her:--\"Madam, thanks be\r\nto God and to you, I now have that which I desired, and therefore 'tis time\r\nthat I make you grateful requital, and take my leave of you.\" The lady\r\nanswered that she was glad if the Countess had gotten aught that gave her\r\njoy; but that 'twas not as hoping to have guerdon thereof that she had done\r\nher part, but simply because she deemed it meet and her duty so to do. \"Well\r\nsaid, madam,\" returned the Countess, \"and in like manner that which you\r\nshall ask of me I shall not give you by way of guerdon, but because I deem\r\nit meet and my duty to give it.\" Whereupon the lady, yielding to necessity,\r\nand abashed beyond measure, asked of her a hundred pounds wherewith to marry\r\nher daughter. The Countess, marking her embarrassment, and the modesty of\r\nher request, gave her five hundred pounds besides jewels fair and rare,\r\nworth, perhaps, no less; and having thus much more than contented her, and\r\nreceived her superabundant thanks, she took leave of her and returned to the\r\ninn. The lady, to render purposeless further visits or messages on\r\nBertrand's part, withdrew with her daughter to the house of her kinsfolk in\r\nthe country; nor was it long before Bertrand, on the urgent entreaty of his\r\nvassals and intelligence of the departure of his wife, quitted Florence and\r\nreturned home. Greatly elated by this intelligence, the Countess tarried\r\nawhile in Florence, and was there delivered of two sons as like as possible\r\nto their father, whom she nurtured with sedulous care. But by and by she saw\r\nfit to take the road, and being come, unrecognized by any, to Montpellier,\r\nrested there a few days; and being on the alert for news of the Count and\r\nwhere he was, she learned that on All Saints' day he was to hold a great\r\nreception of ladies and gentlemen at Roussillon. Whither, retaining her now\r\nwonted pilgrim's weeds, she hied her, and finding that the ladies and\r\ngentlemen were all gathered in the Count's palace and on the point of going\r\nto table, she tarried not to change her dress, but went up into the hall,\r\nbearing her little ones in her arms, and threading her way through the\r\nthrong to the place where she saw the Count stand, she threw herself at his\r\nfeet, and sobbing, said to him:--\"My lord, thy hapless bride am I, who to\r\nensure thy homecoming and abidance in peace have long time been a wanderer,\r\nand now demand of thee observance of the condition whereof word was brought\r\nme by the two knights whom I sent to thee. Lo in my arms not one son only\r\nbut twain, gotten of thee, and on my finger thy ring. 'Tis time, then, that\r\nI be received of thee as thy wife according to thy word.\" Whereat the Count\r\nwas all dumfounded, recognizing the ring and his own lineaments in the\r\nchildren, so like were they to him; but saying to himself nevertheless:--\r\n\"How can it have come about?\" So the Countess, while the Count and all that\r\nwere present marvelled exceedingly, told what had happened, and the manner\r\nof it, in precise detail. Wherefore the Count, perceiving that she spoke\r\ntruth, and having regard to her perseverance and address and her two fine\r\nboys, and the wishes of all his vassals and the ladies, who with one accord\r\nbesought him to own and honour her thenceforth as his lawful bride, laid\r\naside his harsh obduracy, and raised the Countess to her feet, and embraced\r\nand kissed her, and acknowledged her for his lawful wife, and the children\r\nfor his own. Then, having caused her to be rearrayed in garments befitting\r\nher rank, he, to the boundless delight of as many as were there, and of all\r\nother his vassals, gave up that day and some that followed to feasting and\r\nmerrymaking; and did ever thenceforth honour, love and most tenderly cherish\r\nher as his bride and wife.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL X.\r\n\r\n--\r\nAlibech turns hermit, and is taught by Rustico, a monk, how the Devil is put\r\nin hell. She is afterwards conveyed thence, and becomes the wife of\r\nNeerbale.\r\n--\r\n\r\nDioneo, observing that the queen's story, which he had followed with the\r\nclosest attention, was now ended, and that it only remained for him to\r\nspeak, waited not to be bidden, but smilingly thus began:--\r\n\r\nGracious ladies, perchance you have not yet heard how the Devil is put in\r\nhell; wherefore, without deviating far from the topic of which you have\r\ndiscoursed throughout the day, I will tell you how 'tis done; it may be the\r\nlesson will prove inspiring; besides which, you may learn therefrom that,\r\nalbeit Love prefers the gay palace and the dainty chamber to the rude cabin,\r\nyet, for all that, he may at times manifest his might in wilds matted with\r\nforests, rugged with alps, and desolate with caverns: whereby it may be\r\nunderstood that all things are subject to his sway. But--to come to my\r\nstory--I say that in the city of Capsa(1) in Barbary there was once a very\r\nrich man, who with other children had a fair and dainty little daughter,\r\nAlibech by name. Now Alibech, not being a Christian, and hearing many\r\nChristians, that were in the city, speak much in praise of the Christian\r\nFaith and the service of God, did one day inquire of one of them after what\r\nfashion it were possible to serve God with as few impediments as might be,\r\nand was informed that they served God best who most completely renounced the\r\nworld and its affairs; like those who had fixed their abode in the wilds of\r\nthe Thebaid desert. Whereupon, actuated by no sober predilection, but by\r\nchildish impulse, the girl, who was very simple and about fourteen years of\r\nage, said never a word more of the matter, but stole away on the morrow, and\r\nquite alone set out to walk to the Thebaid desert; and, by force of\r\nresolution, albeit with no small suffering, she after some days reached\r\nthose wilds; where, espying a cabin a great way off, she hied her thither,\r\nand found a holy man by the door, who, marvelling to see her there, asked\r\nher what she came there to seek. She answered that, guided by the spirit of\r\nGod, she was come thither, seeking, if haply she might serve Him, and also\r\nfind some one that might teach her how He ought to be served. Marking her\r\nyouth and great beauty, the worthy man, fearing lest, if he suffered her to\r\nremain with him, he should be ensnared by the Devil, commended her good\r\nintention, set before her a frugal repast of roots of herbs, crab-apples and\r\ndates, with a little water to wash them down, and said to her:--\"My\r\ndaughter, there is a holy man not far from here, who is much better able to\r\nteach thee that of which thou art in quest than I am; go to him, therefore;\"\r\nand he shewed her the way. But when she was come whither she was directed,\r\nshe met with the same answer as before, and so, setting forth again, she\r\ncame at length to the cell of a young hermit, a worthy man and very devout--\r\nhis name Rustico--whom she interrogated as she had the others. Rustico,\r\nbeing minded to make severe trial of his constancy, did not send her away,\r\nas the others had done, but kept her with him in his cell, and when night\r\ncame, made her a little bed of palm-leaves; whereon he bade her compose\r\nherself to sleep. Hardly had she done so before the solicitations of the\r\nflesh joined battle with the powers of Rustico's spirit, and he, finding\r\nhimself left in the lurch by the latter, endured not many assaults before he\r\nbeat a retreat, and surrendered at discretion: wherefore he bade adieu to\r\nholy meditation and prayer and discipline, and fell a musing on the youth\r\nand beauty of his companion, and also how he might so order his conversation\r\nwith her, that without seeming to her to be a libertine he might yet compass\r\nthat which he craved of her. So, probing her by certain questions, he\r\ndiscovered that she was as yet entirely without cognizance of man, and as\r\nsimple as she seemed: wherefore he excogitated a plan for bringing her to\r\npleasure him under colour of serving God. He began by giving her a long\r\nlecture on the great enmity that subsists between God and the Devil; after\r\nwhich he gave her to understand that, God having condemned the Devil to\r\nhell, to put him there was of all services the most acceptable to God. The\r\ngirl asking him how it might be done, Rustico answered:--\"Thou shalt know it\r\nin a trice; thou hast but to do that which thou seest me do.\" Then, having\r\ndivested himself of his scanty clothing, he threw himself stark naked on his\r\nknees, as if he would pray; whereby he caused the girl, who followed his\r\nexample, to confront him in the same posture. Whereupon Rustico, seeing her\r\nso fair, felt an accession of desire, and therewith came an insurgence of\r\nthe flesh, which Alibech marking with surprise, said:--\"Rustico, what is\r\nthis, which I see thee have, that so protrudes, and which I have not?\" \"Oh!\r\nmy daughter,\" said Rustico, \"'tis the Devil of whom I have told thee: and,\r\nseest thou? he is now tormenting me most grievously, insomuch that I am\r\nscarce able to hold out.\" Then:--\"Praise be to God,\" said the girl, \"I see\r\nthat I am in better case than thou, for no such Devil have I.\" \"Sooth sayst\r\nthou,\" returned Rustico; \"but instead of him thou hast somewhat else that I\r\nhave not.\" \"Oh!\" said Alibech, \"what may that be?\" \"Hell,\" answered Rustico:\r\n\"and I tell thee, that 'tis my belief that God has sent thee hither for the\r\nsalvation of my soul; seeing that, if this Devil shall continue to plague me\r\nthus, then, so thou wilt have compassion on me and permit me to put him in\r\nhell, thou wilt both afford me great and exceeding great solace, and render\r\nto God an exceeding most acceptable service, if, as thou sayst, thou art\r\ncome into these parts for such a purpose.\" In good faith the girl made\r\nanswer:--\"As I have hell to match your Devil, be it, my father, as and when\r\nyou will.\" Whereupon:--\"Bless thee, my daughter,\" said Rustico, \"go we then,\r\nand put him there, that he leave me henceforth in peace.\" Which said, he\r\ntook the girl to one of the beds and taught her the posture in which she\r\nmust lie in order to incarcerate this spirit accursed of God. The girl,\r\nhaving never before put any devil in hell, felt on this first occasion a\r\ntwinge of pain: wherefore she said to Rustico:--\"Of a surety, my father, he\r\nmust be a wicked fellow, this devil, and in very truth a foe to God; for\r\nthere is sorrow even in hell--not to speak of other places--when he is put\r\nthere.\" \"Daughter,\" said Rustico, \"'twill not be always so.\" And for better\r\nassurance thereof they put him there six times before they quitted the bed;\r\nwhereby they so thoroughly abased his pride that he was fain to be quiet.\r\nHowever, the proud fit returning upon him from time to time, and the girl\r\naddressing herself always obediently to its reduction, it so befell that she\r\nbegan to find the game agreeable, and would say to Rustico:--\"Now see I\r\nplainly that 'twas true, what the worthy men said at Capsa, of the service\r\nof God being so delightful: indeed I cannot remember that in aught that ever\r\nI did I had so much pleasure, so much solace, as in putting the Devil in\r\nhell; for which cause I deem it insensate folly on the part of any one to\r\nhave a care to aught else than the service of God.\" Wherefore many a time\r\nshe would come to Rustico, and say to him:--\"My father, 'twas to serve God\r\nthat I came hither, and not to pass my days in idleness: go we then, and put\r\nthe Devil in hell.\" And while they did so, she would now and again say:--\"I\r\nknow not, Rustico, why the Devil should escape from hell; were he but as\r\nready to stay there as hell is to receive and retain him, he would never\r\ncome out of it.\" So, the girl thus frequently inviting and exhorting Rustico\r\nto the service of God, there came at length a time when she had so\r\nthoroughly lightened his doublet that he shivered when another would have\r\nsweated; wherefore he began to instruct her that the Devil was not to be\r\ncorrected and put in hell, save when his head was exalted with pride;\r\nadding, \"and we by God's grace have brought him to so sober a mind that he\r\nprays God he may be left in peace;\" by which means he for a time kept the\r\ngirl quiet. But when she saw that Rustico had no more occasion for her to\r\nput the Devil in hell, she said to him one day:--\"Rustico, if thy Devil is\r\nchastened and gives thee no more trouble, my hell, on the other hand, gives\r\nme no peace; wherefore, I with my hell have holpen thee to abase the pride\r\nof thy Devil, so thou wouldst do well to lend me the aid of thy Devil to\r\nallay the fervent heat of my hell.\" Rustico, whose diet was roots of herbs\r\nand water, was scarce able to respond to her demands: he told her that\r\n'twould require not a few devils to allay the heat of hell; but that he\r\nwould do what might be in his power; and so now and again he satisfied her;\r\nbut so seldom that 'twas as if he had tossed a bean into the jaws of a lion.\r\nWhereat the girl, being fain of more of the service of God than she had, did\r\nsomewhat repine. However, the case standing thus (deficiency of power\r\nagainst superfluity of desire) between Rustico's Devil and Alibech's hell,\r\nit chanced that a fire broke out in Capsa, whereby the house of Alibech's\r\nfather was burned, and he and all his sons and the rest of his household\r\nperished; so that Alibech was left sole heiress of all his estate. And a\r\nyoung gallant, Neerbale by name, who by reckless munificence had wasted all\r\nhis substance, having discovered that she was alive, addressed himself to\r\nthe pursuit of her, and, having found her in time to prevent the\r\nconfiscation of her father's estate as an escheat for failure of heirs, took\r\nher, much to Rustico's relief and against her own will, back to Capsa, and\r\nmade her his wife, and shared with her her vast patrimony. But before he had\r\nlain with her, she was questioned by the ladies of the manner in which she\r\nhad served God in the desert; whereto she answered, that she had been wont\r\nto serve Him by putting the Devil in hell, and that Neerbale had committed a\r\ngreat sin, when he took her out of such service. The ladies being curious to\r\nknow how the Devil was put in hell, the girl satisfied them, partly by\r\nwords, partly by signs. Whereat they laughed exorbitantly (and still laugh)\r\nand said to her:--\"Be not down-hearted, daughter; 'tis done here too;\r\nNeerbale will know well how to serve God with you in that way.\" And so the\r\nstory passing from mouth to mouth throughout the city, it came at last to be\r\na common proverb, that the most acceptable service that can be rendered to\r\nGod is to put the Devil in hell; which proverb, having travelled hither\r\nacross the sea, is still current. Wherefore, young ladies, you that have\r\nneed of the grace of God, see to it that you learn how to put the Devil in\r\nhell, because 'tis mightily pleasing to God, and of great solace to both the\r\nparties, and much good may thereby be engendered and ensue.\r\n\r\n(1) Now Gafsa, in Tunis.\r\n\r\n\r\nA thousand times or more had Dioneo's story brought the laugh to the lips of\r\nthe honourable ladies, so quaint and curiously entertaining found they the\r\nfashion of it. And now at its close the queen, seeing the term of her\r\nsovereignty come, took the laurel wreath from her head, and with mien most\r\ndebonair, set it on the brow of Filostrato, saying:--\"We shall soon see\r\nwhether the wolf will know better how to guide the sheep than the sheep have\r\nyet succeeded in guiding the wolves.\" Whereat Filostrato said with a laugh:-\r\n-\"Had I been hearkened to, the wolves would have taught the sheep to put the\r\nDevil in hell even as Rustico taught Alibech. Wherefore call us not wolves,\r\nseeing that you have not shewn yourselves sheep: however, as best I may be\r\nable, I will govern the kingdom committed to my charge.\" Whereupon Neifile\r\ntook him up: \"Hark ye, Filostrato,\" she said, \"while you thought to teach\r\nus, you might have learnt a lesson from us, as did Masetto da Lamporecchio\r\nfrom the nuns, and have recovered your speech when the bones had learned to\r\nwhistle without a master.\"(1) Filostrato, perceiving that there was a scythe\r\nfor each of his arrows, gave up jesting, and addressed himself to the\r\ngovernance of his kingdom. He called the seneschal, and held him strictly to\r\naccount in every particular; he then judiciously ordered all matters as he\r\ndeemed would be best and most to the satisfaction of the company, while his\r\nsovereignty should last; and having so done, he turned to the ladies, and\r\nsaid:--\"Loving ladies, as my ill luck would have it, since I have had wit to\r\ntell good from evil, the charms of one or other of you have kept me ever a\r\nslave to Love: and for all I shewed myself humble and obedient and\r\nconformable, so far as I knew how, to all his ways, my fate has been still\r\nthe same, to be discarded for another, and go ever from bad to worse; and\r\nso, I suppose, 'twill be with me to the hour of my death. Wherefore I am\r\nminded that to-morrow our discourse be of no other topic than that which is\r\nmost germane to my condition, to wit, of those whose loves had a disastrous\r\nclose: because mine, I expect, will in the long run be most disastrous; nor\r\nfor other cause was the name, by which you address me, given me by one that\r\nwell knew its signification.\" Which said, he arose, and dismissed them all\r\nuntil supper-time.\r\n\r\nSo fair and delightsome was the garden that none saw fit to quit it, and\r\nseek diversion elsewhere. Rather--for the sun now shone with a tempered\r\nradiance that caused no discomfort--some of the ladies gave chase to the\r\nkids and conies and other creatures that haunted it, and, scampering to and\r\nfro among them as they sate, had caused them a hundred times, or so, some\r\nslight embarrassment. Dioneo and Fiammetta fell a singing of Messer\r\nGuglielmo and the lady of Vergiu.(2) Filomena and Pamfilo sat them down to a\r\ngame of chess; and, as thus they pursued each their several diversions, time\r\nsped so swiftly that the supper-hour stole upon them almost unawares:\r\nwhereupon they ranged the tables round the beautiful fountain, and supped\r\nwith all glad and festal cheer.\r\n\r\nWhen the tables were removed, Filostrato, being minded to follow in the\r\nfootsteps of his fair predecessors in sway, bade Lauretta lead a dance and\r\nsing a song. She answered:--\"My lord, songs of others know I none, nor does\r\nmy memory furnish me with any of mine own that seems meet for so gay a\r\ncompany; but, if you will be content with what I have, gladly will I give\r\nyou thereof.\" \"Nought of thine,\" returned the king, \"could be other than\r\ngoodly and delectable. Wherefore give us even what thou hast.\" So\r\nencouraged, Lauretta, with dulcet voice, but manner somewhat languishing,\r\nraised the ensuing strain, to which the other ladies responded:--\r\n\r\nWhat dame disconsolate\r\nMay so lament as I,\r\nThat vainly sigh, to Love still dedicate?\r\n\r\nHe that the heaven and every orb doth move\r\nFormed me for His delight\r\nFair, debonair and gracious, apt for love;\r\nThat here on earth each soaring spirit might\r\nHave foretaste how, above,\r\nThat beauty shews that standeth in His sight.\r\nAh! but dull wit and slight,\r\nFor that it judgeth ill,\r\nLiketh me not, nay, doth me vilely rate.\r\n\r\nThere was who loved me, and my maiden grace\r\nDid fondly clip and strain,\r\nAs in his arms, so in his soul's embrace,\r\nAnd from mine eyes Love's fire did drink amain,\r\nAnd time that glides apace\r\nIn nought but courting me to spend was fain\r\nWhom courteous I did deign\r\nEv'n as my peer to entreat;\r\nBut am of him bereft! Ah! dolorous fate!\r\n\r\nCame to me next a gallant swol'n with pride,\r\nBrave, in his own conceit,\r\nAnd no less noble eke. Whom woe betide\r\nThat he me took, and holds in all unmeet\r\nSuspicion, jealous-eyed!\r\nAnd I, who wot that me the world should greet\r\nAs the predestined sweet\r\nOf many men, well-nigh\r\nDespair, to be to one thus subjugate.\r\n\r\nAh! woe is me! cursed be the luckless day,\r\nWhen, a new gown to wear,\r\nI said the fatal ay; for blithe and gay\r\nIn that plain gown I lived, no whit less fair;\r\nWhile in this rich array\r\nA sad and far less honoured life I bear!\r\nWould I had died, or e'er\r\nSounded those notes of joy\r\n(Ah! dolorous cheer!) my woe to celebrate!\r\n\r\nSo list my supplication, lover dear,\r\nOf whom such joyance I,\r\nAs ne'er another, had. Thou that in clear\r\nLight of the Maker's presence art, deny\r\nNot pity to thy fere,\r\nWho thee may ne'er forget; but let one sigh\r\nBreathe tidings that on high\r\nThou burnest still for me;\r\nAnd sue of God that He me there translate.\r\n\r\nSo ended Lauretta her song, to which all hearkened attentively, though not\r\nall interpreted it alike. Some were inclined to give it a moral after the\r\nMilanese fashion, to wit, that a good porker was better than a pretty quean.\r\nOthers construed it in a higher, better and truer sense, which 'tis not to\r\nthe present purpose to unfold. Some more songs followed by command of the\r\nking, who caused torches not a few to be lighted and ranged about the\r\nflowery mead; and so the night was prolonged until the last star that had\r\nrisen had begun to set. Then, bethinking him that 'twas time for slumber,\r\nthe king bade all good-night, and dismissed them to their several chambers.\r\n\r\n(1) I.e. when you were so emaciated that your bones made music like a\r\nskeleton in the wind.\r\n\r\n(2) Evidently some version of the tragical conte \"de la Chastelaine de\r\nVergi, qui mori por laialment amer son ami.\" See \"Fabliaux et Contes,\" ed.\r\nBarbazan, iv. 296: and cf. Bandello, Pt. iv. Nov. v, and Heptameron, Journee\r\nvii. Nouvelle lxx.\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nEndeth here the third day of the Decameron, beginneth the fourth, in which,\r\nunder the rule of Filostrato, discourse is had of those whose loves had a\r\ndisastrous close.\r\n--\r\n\r\nDearest ladies, as well from what I heard in converse with the wise, as from\r\nmatters that not seldom fell within my own observation and reading, I formed\r\nthe opinion that the vehement and scorching blast of envy was apt to vent\r\nitself only upon lofty towers or the highest tree-tops: but therein I find\r\nthat I misjudged; for, whereas I ever sought and studied how best to elude\r\nthe buffetings of that furious hurricane, and to that end kept a course not\r\nmerely on the plain, but, by preference, in the depth of the valley; as\r\nshould be abundantly clear to whoso looks at these little stories, written\r\nas they are not only in the vulgar Florentine, and in prose, and without\r\ndedicatory flourish, but also in as homely and simple a style as may be;\r\nnevertheless all this has not stood me in such stead but that I have been\r\nshrewdly shaken, nay, all but uprooted by the blast, and altogether\r\nlacerated by the bite of this same envy. Whereby I may very well understand\r\nthat 'tis true, what the sages aver, that only misery is exempt from envy in\r\nthe present life. Know then, discreet my ladies, that some there are, who,\r\nreading these little stories, have alleged that I am too fond of you, and\r\nthat 'tis not a seemly thing that I should take so much pleasure in\r\nministering to your gratification and solace; and some have found more fault\r\nwith me for praising you as I do. Others, affecting to deliver a more\r\nconsidered judgment, have said that it ill befits my time of life to ensue\r\nsuch matters, to wit, the discoursing of women, or endeavouring to pleasure\r\nthem. And not a few, feigning a mighty tender regard to my fame, aver that I\r\nshould do more wisely to keep ever with the Muses on Parnassus, than to\r\nforgather with you in such vain dalliance. Those again there are, who,\r\nevincing less wisdom than despite, have told me that I should shew sounder\r\nsense if I bethought me how to get my daily bread, than, going after these\r\nidle toys, to nourish myself upon the wind; while certain others, in\r\ndisparagement of my work, strive might and main to make it appear that the\r\nmatters which I relate fell out otherwise than as I set them forth. Such\r\nthen, noble ladies, are the blasts, such the sharp and cruel fangs, by\r\nwhich, while I champion your cause, I am assailed, harassed and well-nigh\r\npierced through and through. Which censures I hear and mark, God knows, with\r\nequal mind: and, though to you belongs all my defence, yet I mean not to be\r\nniggard of my own powers, but rather, without dealing out to them the\r\ncastigation they deserve, to give them such slight answer as may secure my\r\nears some respite of their clamour; and that without delay; seeing that, if\r\nalready, though I have not completed the third part of my work, they are not\r\na few and very presumptuous, I deem it possible, that before I have reached\r\nthe end, should they receive no check, they may have grown so numerous, that\r\n'twould scarce tax their powers to sink me; and that your forces, great\r\nthough they be, would not suffice to withstand them. However I am minded to\r\nanswer none of them, until I have related in my behoof, not indeed an entire\r\nstory, for I would not seem to foist my stories in among those of so\r\nhonourable a company as that with which I have made you acquainted, but a\r\npart of one, that its very incompleteness may shew that it is not one of\r\nthem: wherefore, addressing my assailants, I say:--That in our city there\r\nwas in old time a citizen named Filippo Balducci, a man of quite low origin,\r\nbut of good substance and well versed and expert in matters belonging to his\r\ncondition, who had a wife that he most dearly loved, as did she him, so that\r\ntheir life passed in peace and concord, nor there was aught they studied so\r\nmuch as how to please each other perfectly. Now it came to pass, as it does\r\nto every one, that the good lady departed this life, leaving Filippo nought\r\nof hers but an only son, that she had had by him, and who was then about two\r\nyears old. His wife's death left Filippo as disconsolate as ever was any man\r\nfor the loss of a loved one: and sorely missing the companionship that was\r\nmost dear to him, he resolved to have done with the world, and devote\r\nhimself and his little son to the service of God. Wherefore, having\r\ndedicated all his goods to charitable uses, he forthwith betook him to the\r\nsummit of Monte Asinaio, where he installed himself with his son in a little\r\ncell, and living on alms, passed his days in fasting and prayer, being\r\ncareful above all things to say nothing to the boy of any temporal matters,\r\nnor to let him see aught of the kind, lest they should distract his mind\r\nfrom his religious exercises, but discoursing with him continually of the\r\nglory of the life eternal and of God and the saints, and teaching him nought\r\nelse but holy orisons: in which way of life he kept him not a few years,\r\nnever suffering him to quit the cell or see aught but himself. From time to\r\ntime the worthy man would go Florence, where divers of the faithful would\r\nafford him relief according to his needs, and so he would return to his\r\ncell. And thus it fell out that one day Filippo, now an aged man, being\r\nasked by the boy, who was about eighteen years old, whither he went, told\r\nhim. Whereupon:--\"Father,\" said the boy, \"you are now old, and scarce able\r\nto support fatigue; why take you me not with you for once to Florence, and\r\ngive me to know devout friends of God and you, so that I, who am young and\r\nfitter for such exertion than you, may thereafter go to Florence for our\r\nsupplies at your pleasure, and you remain here?\"\r\n\r\nThe worthy man, bethinking him that his son was now grown up, and so\r\nhabituated to the service of God as hardly to be seduced by the things of\r\nthe world, said to himself:--\"He says well.\" And so, as he must needs go to\r\nFlorence, he took the boy with him. Where, seeing the palaces, the houses,\r\nthe churches, and all matters else with which the city abounds, and of which\r\nhe had no more recollection than if he had never seen them, the boy found\r\nall passing strange, and questioned his father of not a few of them, what\r\nthey were and how they were named; his curiosity being no sooner satisfied\r\nin one particular than he plied his father with a further question. And so\r\nit befell that, while son and father were thus occupied in asking and\r\nanswering questions, they encountered a bevy of damsels, fair and richly\r\narrayed, being on their return from a wedding; whom the young man no sooner\r\nsaw, than he asked his father what they might be. \"My son,\" answered the\r\nfather, \"fix thy gaze on the ground, regard them not at all, for naughty\r\nthings are they.\" \"Oh!\" said the son, \"and what is their name?\" The father,\r\nfearing to awaken some mischievous craving of concupiscence in the young\r\nman, would not denote them truly, to wit, as women, but said:--\"They are\r\ncalled goslings.\" Whereupon, wonderful to tell! the lad who had never before\r\nset eyes on any woman, thought no more of the palaces, the oxen, the horses,\r\nthe asses, the money, or aught else that he had seen, but\r\nexclaimed:--\"Prithee, father, let me have one of those goslings.\" \"Alas, my\r\nson,\" replied the father, \"speak not of them; they are naughty things.\"\r\n\"Oh!\" questioned the son; \"but are naughty things made like that?\" \"Ay,\"\r\nreturned the father. Whereupon the son:--\"I know not,\" he said, \"what you\r\nsay, nor why they should be naughty things: for my part I have as yet seen\r\nnought that seemed to me so fair and delectable. They are fairer than the\r\npainted angels that you have so often shewn me. Oh! if you love me, do but\r\nlet us take one of these goslings up there, and I will see that she have\r\nwhereon to bill.\" \"Nay,\" said the father, \"that will not I. Thou knowest not\r\nwhereon they bill;\" and straightway, being ware that nature was more potent\r\nthan his art, he repented him that he had brought the boy to Florence.\r\n\r\nBut enough of this story: 'tis time for me to cut it short, and return to\r\nthose, for whose instruction 'tis told. They say then, some of these my\r\ncensors, that I am too fond of you, young ladies, and am at too great pains\r\nto pleasure you. Now that I am fond of you, and am at pains to pleasure you,\r\nI do most frankly and fully confess; and I ask them whether, considering\r\nonly all that it means to have had, and to have continually, before one's\r\neyes your debonair demeanour, your bewitching beauty and exquisite grace,\r\nand therewithal your modest womanliness, not to speak of having known the\r\namorous kisses, the caressing embraces, the voluptuous comminglings, whereof\r\nour intercourse with you, ladies most sweet, not seldom is productive, they\r\ndo verily marvel that I am fond of you, seeing that one who was nurtured,\r\nreared, and brought up on a savage and solitary mountain, within the narrow\r\ncircuit of a cell, without other companion than his father, had no sooner\r\nseen you than 'twas you alone that he desired, that he demanded, that he\r\nsought with ardour? Will they tear, will they lacerate me with their\r\ncensures, if I, whose body Heaven fashioned all apt for love, whose soul\r\nfrom very boyhood was dedicate to you, am not insensible to the power of the\r\nlight of your eyes, to the sweetness of your honeyed words, to the flame\r\nthat is kindled by your gentle sighs, but am fond of you and sedulous to\r\npleasure you; you, again I bid them remember, in whom a hermit, a rude,\r\nwitless lad, liker to an animal than to a human being, found more to delight\r\nhim than in aught else that he saw? Of a truth whoso taxes me thus must be\r\none that, feeling, knowing nought of the pleasure and power of natural\r\naffection, loves you not, nor craves your love; and such an one I hold in\r\nlight esteem. And as for those that go about to find ground of exception in\r\nmy age, they do but shew that they ill understand that the leek, albeit its\r\nhead is white, has a green tail. But jesting apart, thus I answer them, that\r\nnever to the end of my life shall I deem it shameful to me to pleasure those\r\nto whom Guido Cavalcanti and Dante Alighieri in their old age, and Messer\r\nCino da Pistoia in extreme old age, accounted it an honour and found it a\r\ndelight to minister gratification. And but that 'twere a deviation from the\r\nuse and wont of discourse, I would call history to my aid, and shew it to\r\nabound with stories of noble men of old time, who in their ripest age\r\nstudied above all things else to pleasure the ladies; whereof if they be\r\nignorant, go they and get them to school. To keep with the Muses on\r\nParnassus is counsel I approve; but tarry with them always we cannot, nor\r\nthey with us, nor is a man blameworthy, if, when he happen to part from\r\nthem, he find his delight in those that resemble them. The Muses are ladies,\r\nand albeit ladies are not the peers of the Muses, yet they have their\r\noutward semblance; for which cause, if for no other, 'tis reasonable that I\r\nshould be fond of them. Besides which, ladies have been to me the occasion\r\nof composing some thousand verses, but of never a verse that I made were the\r\nMuses the occasion. Howbeit 'twas with their aid, 'twas under their\r\ninfluence that I composed those thousand verses, and perchance they have\r\nsometimes visited me to encourage me in my present task, humble indeed\r\nthough it be, doing honour and paying, as it were, tribute, to the likeness\r\nwhich the ladies have to them; wherefore, while I weave these stories, I\r\nstray not so far from Mount Parnassus and the Muses as not a few perchance\r\nsuppose. But what shall we say to those, in whom my hunger excites such\r\ncommiseration that they bid me get me bread? Verily I know not, save this:--\r\nSuppose that in my need I were to beg bread of them, what would be their\r\nanswer? I doubt not they would say:--\"Go seek it among the fables.\" And in\r\nsooth the poets have found more bread among their fables than many rich men\r\namong their treasures. And many that have gone after fables have crowned\r\ntheir days with splendour, while, on the other hand, not a few, in the\r\nendeavour to get them more bread than they needed, have perished miserably.\r\nBut why waste more words on them? Let them send me packing, when I ask bread\r\nof them; not that, thank God, I have yet need of it, and should I ever come\r\nto be in need of it, I know, like the Apostle, how to abound and to be in\r\nwant, and so am minded to be beholden to none but myself. As for those who\r\nsay that these matters fell out otherwise than as I relate them, I should\r\naccount it no small favour, if they would produce the originals, and should\r\nwhat I write not accord with them, I would acknowledge the justice of their\r\ncensure, and study to amend my ways; but, until better evidence is\r\nforthcoming than their words, I shall adhere to my own opinion without\r\nseeking to deprive them of theirs, and give them tit for tat. And being\r\nminded that for this while this answer suffice, I say that with God and you,\r\nin whom I trust, most gentle ladies, to aid and protect me, and patience for\r\nmy stay, I shall go forward with my work, turning my back on this tempest,\r\nhowever it may rage; for I see not that I can fare worse than the fine dust,\r\nwhich the blast of the whirlwind either leaves where it lies, or bears\r\naloft, not seldom over the heads of men, over the crowns of kings, of\r\nemperors, and sometimes suffers to settle on the roofs of lofty palaces, and\r\nthe summits of the tallest towers, whence if it fall, it cannot sink lower\r\nthan the level from which it was raised. And if I ever devoted myself and\r\nall my powers to minister in any wise to your gratification, I am now minded\r\nmore than ever so to do, because I know that there is nought that any can\r\njustly say in regard thereof, but that I, and others who love you, follow\r\nthe promptings of nature, whose laws whoso would withstand, has need of\r\npowers pre-eminent, and, even so, will oft-times labour not merely in vain\r\nbut to his own most grievous disadvantage. Such powers I own that I neither\r\nhave, nor, to such end, desire to have; and had I them, I would rather leave\r\nthem to another than use them myself. Wherefore let my detractors hold their\r\npeace, and if they cannot get heat, why, let them shiver their life away;\r\nand, while they remain addicted to their delights, or rather corrupt tastes,\r\nlet them leave me to follow my own bent during the brief life that is\r\naccorded us. But this has been a long digression, fair ladies, and 'tis time\r\nto retrace our steps to the point where we deviated, and continue in the\r\ncourse on which we started.\r\n\r\nThe sun had chased every star from the sky, and lifted the dank murk of\r\nnight from the earth, when, Filostrato being risen, and having roused all\r\nhis company, they hied them to the fair garden, and there fell to disporting\r\nthemselves: the time for breakfast being come, they took it where they had\r\nsupped on the preceding evening, and after they had slept they rose, when\r\nthe sun was in his zenith, and seated themselves in their wonted manner by\r\nthe beautiful fountain; where Fiammetta, being bidden by Filostrato to lead\r\noff the story-telling, awaited no second command, but debonairly thus began.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL I.\r\n\r\n--\r\nTancred, Prince of Salerno, slays his daughter's lover, and sends her his\r\nheart in a golden cup: she pours upon it a poisonous distillation, which she\r\ndrinks and dies.\r\n--\r\n\r\nA direful theme has our king allotted us for to-day's discourse seeing that,\r\nwhereas we are here met for our common delectation, needs must we now tell\r\nof others' tears, whereby, whether telling or hearing, we cannot but be\r\nmoved to pity. Perchance 'twas to temper in some degree the gaiety of the\r\npast days that he so ordained, but, whatever may have been his intent, his\r\nwill must be to me immutable law; wherefore I will narrate to you a matter\r\nthat befell piteously, nay woefully, and so as you may well weep thereat.\r\n\r\nTancred, Prince of Salerno, a lord most humane and kind of heart, but that\r\nin his old age he imbrued his hands in the blood of a lover, had in the\r\nwhole course of his life but one daughter; and had he not had her, he had\r\nbeen more fortunate.\r\n\r\nNever was daughter more tenderly beloved of father than she of the Prince,\r\nwho, for that cause not knowing how to part with her, kept her unmarried for\r\nmany a year after she had come of marriageable age: then at last he gave her\r\nto a son of the Duke of Capua, with whom she had lived but a short while,\r\nwhen he died and she returned to her father. Most lovely was she of form and\r\nfeature (never woman more so), and young and light of heart, and more\r\nknowing, perchance, than beseemed a woman. Dwelling thus with her loving\r\nfather, as a great lady, in no small luxury, nor failing to see that the\r\nPrince, for the great love he bore her, was at no pains to provide her with\r\nanother husband, and deeming it unseemly on her part to ask one of him, she\r\ncast about how she might come by a gallant to be her secret lover. And\r\nseeing at her father's court not a few men, both gentle and simple, that\r\nresorted thither, as we know men use to frequent courts, and closely\r\nscanning their mien and manners, she preferred before all others the\r\nPrince's page, Guiscardo by name, a man of very humble origin, but\r\npre-eminent for native worth and noble bearing; of whom, seeing him\r\nfrequently, she became hotly enamoured, hourly extolling his qualities more\r\nand more highly. The young man, who for all his youth by no means lacked\r\nshrewdness, read her heart, and gave her his own on such wise that his love\r\nfor her engrossed his mind to the exclusion of almost everything else. While\r\nthus they burned in secret for one another, the lady, desiring of all things\r\na meeting with Guiscardo, but being shy of making any her confidant, hit\r\nupon a novel expedient to concert the affair with him. She wrote him a\r\nletter containing her commands for the ensuing day, and thrust it into a\r\ncane in the space between two of the knots, which cane she gave to\r\nGuiscardo, saying:--\"Thou canst let thy servant have it for a bellows to\r\nblow thy fire up to night.\" Guiscardo took it, and feeling sure that 'twas\r\nnot unadvisedly that she made him such a present, accompanied with such\r\nwords, hied him straight home, where, carefully examining the cane, he\r\nobserved that it was cleft, and, opening it, found the letter; which he had\r\nno sooner read, and learned what he was to do, than, pleased as ne'er\r\nanother, he fell to devising how to set all in order that he might not fail\r\nto meet the lady on the following day, after the manner she had prescribed.\r\n\r\nNow hard by the Prince's palace was a grotto, hewn in days of old in the\r\nsolid rock, and now long disused, so that an artificial orifice, by which it\r\nreceived a little light, was all but choked with brambles and plants that\r\ngrew about and overspread it. From one of the ground-floor rooms of the\r\npalace, which room was part of the lady's suite, a secret stair led to the\r\ngrotto, though the entrance was barred by a very strong door. This stair,\r\nhaving been from time immemorial disused, had passed out of mind so\r\ncompletely that there was scarce any that remembered that it was there: but\r\nLove, whose eyes nothing, however secret, may escape, had brought it to the\r\nmind of the enamoured lady. For many a day, using all secrecy, that none\r\nshould discover her, she had wrought with her tools, until she had succeeded\r\nin opening the door; which done, she had gone down into the grotto alone,\r\nand having observed the orifice, had by her letter apprised Guiscardo of its\r\napparent height above the floor of the grotto, and bidden him contrive some\r\nmeans of descending thereby. Eager to carry the affair through, Guiscardo\r\nlost no time in rigging up a ladder of ropes, whereby he might ascend and\r\ndescend; and having put on a suit of leather to protect him from the\r\nbrambles, he hied him the following night (keeping the affair close from\r\nall) to the orifice, made the ladder fast by one of its ends to a massive\r\ntrunk that was rooted in the mouth of the orifice, climbed down the ladder,\r\nand awaited the lady. On the morrow, making as if she would fain sleep, the\r\nlady dismissed her damsels, and locked herself into her room: she then\r\nopened the door of the grotto, hied her down, and met Guiscardo, to their\r\nmarvellous mutual satisfaction. The lovers then repaired to her room, where\r\nin exceeding great joyance they spent no small part of the day. Nor were\r\nthey neglectful of the precautions needful to prevent discovery of their\r\namour; but in due time Guiscardo returned to the grotto; whereupon the lady\r\nlocked the door and rejoined her damsels. At nightfall Guiscardo reascended\r\nhis ladder, and, issuing forth of the orifice, hied him home; nor, knowing\r\nnow the way, did he fail to revisit the grotto many a time thereafter.\r\n\r\nBut Fortune, noting with envious eye a happiness of such degree and\r\nduration, gave to events a dolorous turn, whereby the joy of the two lovers\r\nwas converted into bitter lamentation. 'Twas Tancred's custom to come from\r\ntime to time quite alone to his daughter's room, and tarry talking with her\r\na while. Whereby it so befell that he came down there one day after\r\nbreakfast, while Ghismonda--such was the lady's name--was in her garden with\r\nher damsels; so that none saw or heard him enter; nor would he call his\r\ndaughter, for he was minded that she should not forgo her pleasure. But,\r\nfinding the windows closed and the bed-curtains drawn down, he seated\r\nhimself on a divan that stood at one of the corners of the bed, rested his\r\nhead on the bed, drew the curtain over him, and thus, hidden as if of set\r\npurpose, fell asleep. As he slept Ghismonda, who, as it happened, had caused\r\nGuiscardo to come that day, left her damsels in the garden, softly entered\r\nthe room, and having locked herself in, unwitting that there was another in\r\nthe room, opened the door to Guiscardo, who was in waiting. Straightway they\r\ngot them to bed, as was their wont; and, while they there solaced and\r\ndisported them together, it so befell that Tancred awoke, and heard and saw\r\nwhat they did: whereat he was troubled beyond measure, and at first was\r\nminded to upbraid them; but on second thoughts he deemed it best to hold his\r\npeace, and avoid discovery, if so he might with greater stealth and less\r\ndishonour carry out the design which was already in his mind. The two lovers\r\ncontinued long together, as they were wont, all unwitting of Tancred; but at\r\nlength they saw fit to get out of bed, when Guiscardo went back to the\r\ngrotto, and the lady hied her forth of the room. Whereupon Tancred, old\r\nthough he was, got out at one of the windows, clambered down into the\r\ngarden, and, seen by none, returned sorely troubled to his room. By his\r\ncommand two men took Guiscardo early that same night, as he issued forth of\r\nthe orifice accoutred in his suit of leather, and brought him privily to\r\nTancred; who, as he saw him, all but wept, and said:--\"Guiscardo, my\r\nkindness to thee is ill requited by the outrage and dishonour which thou\r\nhast done me in the person of my daughter, as to-day I have seen with my own\r\neyes.\" To whom Guiscardo could answer nought but:--\"Love is more potent than\r\neither, you or I.\" Tancred then gave order to keep him privily under watch\r\nand ward in a room within the palace; and so 'twas done. Next day, while\r\nGhismonda wotted nought of these matters, Tancred, after pondering divers\r\nnovel expedients, hied him after breakfast, according to his wont, to his\r\ndaughter's room, where, having called her to him and locked himself in with\r\nher, he began, not without tears, to speak on this wise:--\"Ghismonda,\r\nconceiving that I knew thy virtue and honour, never, though it had been\r\nreported to me, would I have credited, had I not seen with my own eyes, that\r\nthou wouldst so much as in idea, not to say fact, have ever yielded thyself\r\nto any man but thy husband: wherefore, for the brief residue of life that my\r\nage has in store for me, the memory of thy fall will ever be grievous to me.\r\nAnd would to God, as thou must needs demean thyself to such dishonour, thou\r\nhadst taken a man that matched thy nobility; but of all the men that\r\nfrequent my court; thou must needs choose Guiscardo, a young man of the\r\nlowest condition, a fellow whom we brought up in charity from his tender\r\nyears; for whose sake thou hast plunged me into the abyss of mental\r\ntribulation, insomuch that I know not what course to take in regard of thee.\r\nAs to Guiscardo, whom I caused to be arrested last night as he issued from\r\nthe orifice, and keep in durance, my course is already taken, but how I am\r\nto deal with thee, God knows, I know not. I am distraught between the love\r\nwhich I have ever borne thee, love such as no father ever bare to daughter,\r\nand the most just indignation evoked in me by thy signal folly; my love\r\nprompts me to pardon thee, my indignation bids me harden my heart against\r\nthee, though I do violence to my nature. But before I decide upon my course,\r\nI would fain hear what thou hast to say to this.\" So saying, he bent his\r\nhead, and wept as bitterly as any child that had been soundly thrashed.\r\n\r\nHer father's words, and the tidings they conveyed that not only was her\r\nsecret passion discovered, but Guiscardo taken, caused Ghismonda\r\nimmeasurable grief, which she was again and again on the point of evincing,\r\nas most women do, by cries and tears; but her high spirit triumphed over\r\nthis weakness; by a prodigious effort she composed her countenance, and\r\ntaking it for granted that her Guiscardo was no more, she inly devoted\r\nherself to death rather than a single prayer for herself should escape her\r\nlips. Wherefore, not as a woman stricken with grief or chidden for a fault,\r\nbut unconcerned and unabashed, with tearless eyes, and frank and utterly\r\ndauntless mien, thus answered she her father:--\"Tancred, your accusation I\r\nshall not deny, neither will I cry you mercy, for nought should I gain by\r\ndenial, nor aught would I gain by supplication: nay more; there is nought I\r\nwill do to conciliate thy humanity and love; my only care is to confess the\r\ntruth, to defend my honour by words of sound reason, and then by deeds most\r\nresolute to give effect to the promptings of my high soul. True it is that I\r\nhave loved and love Guiscardo, and during the brief while I have yet to live\r\nshall love him, nor after death, so there be then love, shall I cease to\r\nlove him; but that I love him, is not imputable to my womanly frailty so\r\nmuch as to the little zeal thou shewedst for my bestowal in marriage, and to\r\nGuiscardo's own worth. It should not have escaped thee, Tancred, creature of\r\nflesh and blood as thou art, that thy daughter was also a creature of flesh\r\nand blood, and not of stone or iron; it was, and is, thy duty to bear in\r\nmind (old though thou art) the nature and the might of the laws to which\r\nyouth is subject; and, though thou hast spent part of thy best years in\r\nmartial exercises, thou shouldst nevertheless have not been ignorant how\r\npotent is the influence even upon the aged--to say nothing of the young--of\r\nease and luxury. And not only am I, as being thy daughter, a creature of\r\nflesh and blood, but my life is not so far spent but that I am still young,\r\nand thus doubly fraught with fleshly appetite, the vehemence whereof is\r\nmarvellously enhanced by reason that, having been married, I have known the\r\npleasure that ensues upon the satisfaction of such desire. Which forces\r\nbeing powerless to withstand, I did but act as was natural in a young woman,\r\nwhen I gave way to them, and yielded myself to love. Nor in sooth did I fail\r\nto the utmost of my power so to order the indulgence of my natural\r\npropensity that my sin should bring shame neither upon thee nor upon me. To\r\nwhich end Love in his pity, and Fortune in a friendly mood, found and\r\ndiscovered to me a secret way, whereby, none witting, I attained my desire:\r\nthis, from whomsoever thou hast learned it, howsoever thou comest to know\r\nit, I deny not. 'Twas not at random, as many women do, that I loved\r\nGuiscardo; but by deliberate choice I preferred him before all other men,\r\nand of determinate forethought I lured him to my love, whereof, through his\r\nand my discretion and constancy, I have long had joyance. Wherein 'twould\r\nseem that thou, following rather the opinion of the vulgar than the dictates\r\nof truth, find cause to chide me more severely than in my sinful love, for,\r\nas if thou wouldst not have been vexed, had my choice fallen on a nobleman,\r\nthou complainest that I have forgathered with a man of low condition; and\r\ndost not see that therein thou censurest not my fault but that of Fortune,\r\nwhich not seldom raises the unworthy to high place and leaves the worthiest\r\nin low estate. But leave we this: consider a little the principles of\r\nthings: thou seest that in regard of our flesh we are all moulded of the\r\nsame substance, and that all souls are endowed by one and the same Creator\r\nwith equal faculties, equal powers, equal virtues. 'Twas merit that made the\r\nfirst distinction between us, born as we were, nay, as we are, all equal,\r\nand those whose merits were and were approved in act the greatest were\r\ncalled noble, and the rest were not so denoted. Which law, albeit overlaid\r\nby the contrary usage of after times, is not yet abrogated, nor so impaired\r\nbut that it is still traceable in nature and good manners; for which cause\r\nwhoso with merit acts, does plainly shew himself a gentleman; and if any\r\ndenote him otherwise, the default is his own and not his whom he so denotes.\r\nPass in review all thy nobles, weigh their merits, their manners and\r\nbearing, and then compare Guiscardo's qualities with theirs: if thou wilt\r\njudge without prejudice, thou wilt pronounce him noble in the highest\r\ndegree, and thy nobles one and all churls. As to Guiscardo's merits and\r\nworth I did but trust the verdict which thou thyself didst utter in words,\r\nand which mine own eyes confirmed. Of whom had he such commendation as of\r\nthee for all those excellences whereby a good man and true merits\r\ncommendation? And in sooth thou didst him but justice; for, unless mine eyes\r\nhave played me false, there was nought for which thou didst commend him but\r\nI had seen him practise it, and that more admirably than words of thine\r\nmight express; and had I been at all deceived in this matter, 'twould have\r\nbeen by thee. Wilt thou say then that I have forgathered with a man of low\r\ncondition? If so, thou wilt not say true. Didst thou say with a poor man,\r\nthe impeachment might be allowed, to thy shame, that thou so ill hast known\r\nhow to requite a good man and true that is thy servant; but poverty, though\r\nit take away all else, deprives no man of gentilesse. Many kings, many great\r\nprinces, were once poor, and many a ditcher or herdsman has been and is very\r\nwealthy. As for thy last perpended doubt, to wit, how thou shouldst deal\r\nwith me, banish it utterly from thy thoughts. If in thy extreme old age thou\r\nart minded to manifest a harshness unwonted in thy youth, wreak thy\r\nharshness on me, resolved as I am to cry thee no mercy, prime cause as I am\r\nthat this sin, if sin it be, has been committed; for of this I warrant thee,\r\nthat as thou mayst have done or shalt do to Guiscardo, if to me thou do not\r\nthe like, I with my own hands will do it. Now get thee gone to shed thy\r\ntears with the women, and when thy melting mood is over, ruthlessly destroy\r\nGuiscardo and me, if such thou deem our merited doom, by one and the same\r\nblow.\"\r\n\r\nThe loftiness of his daughter's spirit was not unknown to the Prince; but\r\nstill he did not credit her with a resolve quite as firmly fixed as her\r\nwords implied, to carry their purport into effect. So, parting from her\r\nwithout the least intention of using harshness towards her in her own\r\nperson, he determined to quench the heat of her love by wreaking his\r\nvengeance on her lover, and bade the two men that had charge of Guiscardo to\r\nstrangle him noiselessly that same night, take the heart out of the body,\r\nand send it to him. The men did his bidding: and on the morrow the Prince\r\nhad a large and beautiful cup of gold brought to him, and having put\r\nGuiscardo's heart therein, sent it by the hand of one of his most trusted\r\nservants to his daughter, charging the servant to say, as he gave it to\r\nher:--\"Thy father sends thee this to give thee joy of that which thou lovest\r\nbest, even as thou hast given him joy of that which he loved best.\"\r\n\r\nNow when her father had left her, Ghismonda, wavering not a jot in her stern\r\nresolve, had sent for poisonous herbs and roots, and therefrom had distilled\r\na water, to have it ready for use, if that which she apprehended should come\r\nto pass. And when the servant appeared with the Prince's present and\r\nmessage, she took the cup unblenchingly, and having lifted the lid, and seen\r\nthe heart, and apprehended the meaning of the words, and that the heart was\r\nbeyond a doubt Guiscardo's, she raised her head, and looking straight at the\r\nservant, said:--\"Sepulture less honourable than of gold had ill befitted\r\nheart such as this: herein has my father done wisely.\" Which said, she\r\nraised it to her lips, and kissed it, saying:--\"In all things and at all\r\ntimes, even to this last hour of my life, have I found my father most tender\r\nin his love, but now more so than ever before; wherefore I now render him\r\nthe last thanks which will ever be due from me to him for this goodly\r\npresent.\" So she spoke, and straining the cup to her, bowed her head over\r\nit, and gazing at the heart, said:--\"Ah! sojourn most sweet of all my joys,\r\naccursed be he by whose ruthless act I see thee with the bodily eye: 'twas\r\nenough that to the mind's eye thou wert hourly present. Thou hast run thy\r\ncourse; thou hast closed the span that Fortune allotted thee; thou hast\r\nreached the goal of all; thou hast left behind thee the woes and weariness\r\nof the world; and thy enemy has himself granted thee sepulture accordant\r\nwith thy deserts. No circumstance was wanting to duly celebrate thy\r\nobsequies, save the tears of her whom, while thou livedst, thou didst so\r\ndearly love; which that thou shouldst not lack, my remorseless father was\r\nprompted of God to send thee to me, and, albeit my resolve was fixed to die\r\nwith eyes unmoistened and front all unperturbed by fear, yet will I accord\r\nthee my tears; which done, my care shall be forthwith by thy means to join\r\nmy soul to that most precious soul which thou didst once enshrine. And is\r\nthere other company than hers, in which with more of joy and peace I might\r\nfare to the abodes unknown? She is yet here within, I doubt not,\r\ncontemplating the abodes of her and my delights, and--for sure I am that she\r\nloves me--awaiting my soul that loves her before all else.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken, she bowed herself low over the cup; and, while no\r\nwomanish cry escaped her, 'twas as if a fountain of water were unloosed\r\nwithin her head, so wondrous a flood of tears gushed from her eyes, while\r\ntimes without number she kissed the dead heart. Her damsels that stood\r\naround her knew not whose the heart might be or what her words might mean,\r\nbut melting in sympathy, they all wept, and compassionately, as vainly,\r\nenquired the cause of her lamentation, and in many other ways sought to\r\ncomfort her to the best of their understanding and power. When she had wept\r\nher fill, she raised her head, and dried her eyes. Then:--\"O heart,\" said\r\nshe, \"much cherished heart, discharged is my every duty towards thee; nought\r\nnow remains for me to do but to come and unite my soul with thine.\" So\r\nsaying, she sent for the vase that held the water which the day before she\r\nhad distilled, and emptied it into the cup where lay the heart bathed in her\r\ntears; then, nowise afraid, she set her mouth to the cup, and drained it\r\ndry, and so with the cup in her hand she got her upon her bed, and having\r\nthere disposed her person in guise as seemly as she might, laid her dead\r\nlover's heart upon her own, and silently awaited death. Meanwhile the\r\ndamsels, seeing and hearing what passed, but knowing not what the water was\r\nthat she had drunk, had sent word of each particular to Tancred; who,\r\napprehensive of that which came to pass, came down with all haste to his\r\ndaughter's room, where he arrived just as she got her upon her bed, and, now\r\ntoo late, addressed himself to comfort her with soft words, and seeing in\r\nwhat plight she was, burst into a flood of bitter tears. To whom the lady:--\r\n\"Reserve thy tears, Tancred, till Fortune send thee hap less longed for than\r\nthis: waste them not on me who care not for them. Whoever yet saw any but\r\nthee bewail the consummation of his desire? But, if of the love thou once\r\ndidst bear me any spark still lives in thee, be it thy parting grace to me,\r\nthat, as thou brookedst not that I should live with Guiscardo in privity and\r\nseclusion, so wherever thou mayst have caused Guiscardo's body to be cast,\r\nmine may be united with it in the common view of all.\" The Prince replied\r\nnot for excess of grief; and the lady, feeling that her end was come,\r\nstrained the dead heart to her bosom, saying:--\"Fare ye well; I take my\r\nleave of you;\" and with eyelids drooped and every sense evanished departed\r\nthis life of woe. Such was the lamentable end of the loves of Guiscardo and\r\nGhismonda; whom Tancred, tardily repentant of his harshness, mourned not a\r\nlittle, as did also all the folk of Salerno, and had honourably interred\r\nside by side in the same tomb.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL II.\r\n\r\n--\r\nFra Alberto gives a lady to understand that she is beloved of the Angel\r\nGabriel, in whose shape he lies with her sundry times; afterward, for fear\r\nof her kinsmen, he flings himself forth of her house, and finds shelter in\r\nthe house of a poor man, who on the morrow leads him in the guise of a wild\r\nman into the piazza, where, being recognized, he is apprehended by his\r\nbrethren and imprisoned.\r\n--\r\n\r\nMore than once had Fiammetta's story brought tears to the eyes of her fair\r\ncompanions; but now that it was ended the king said with an austere air:--\"I\r\nshould esteem my life but a paltry price to pay for half the delight that\r\nGhismonda had with Guiscardo: whereat no lady of you all should marvel,\r\nseeing that each hour that I live I die a thousand deaths; nor is there so\r\nmuch as a particle of compensating joy allotted me. But a truce to my own\r\nconcerns: I ordain that Pampinea do next ensue our direful argument,\r\nwherewith the tenor of my life in part accords, and if she follow in\r\nFiammetta's footsteps, I doubt not I shall presently feel some drops of dew\r\ndistill upon my fire.\" Pampinea received the king's command in a spirit more\r\naccordant with what from her own bent she divined to be the wishes of her\r\nfair gossips than with the king's words; wherefore, being minded rather to\r\nafford them some diversion, than, save as in duty bound, to satisfy the\r\nking, she made choice of a story which, without deviating from the\r\nprescribed theme, should move a laugh, and thus began:--\r\n\r\n'Tis a proverb current among the vulgar, that:--\"Whoso, being wicked, is\r\nrighteous reputed, May sin as he will, and 'twill ne'er be imputed.\" Which\r\nproverb furnishes me with abundant matter of discourse, germane to our\r\ntheme, besides occasion to exhibit the quality and degree of the hypocrisy\r\nof the religious, who flaunt it in ample flowing robes, and, with faces made\r\npallid by art, with voices low and gentle to beg alms, most loud and haughty\r\nto reprove in others their own sins, would make believe that their way of\r\nsalvation lies in taking from us and ours in giving to them; nay, more, as\r\nif they had not like us Paradise to win, but were already its lords and\r\nmasters, assign therein to each that dies a place more or less exalted\r\naccording to the amount of the money that he has bequeathed to them; which\r\nif they believe, 'tis by dint of self-delusion, and to the effect of\r\ndeluding all that put faith in their words. Of whose guile were it lawful\r\nfor me to make as full exposure as were fitting, not a few simple folk\r\nshould soon be enlightened as to what they cloak within the folds of their\r\nvoluminous habits. But would to God all might have the like reward of their\r\nlies as a certain friar minor, no novice, but one that was reputed among\r\ntheir greatest(1) at Venice; whose story, rather than aught else, I am\r\nminded to tell you, if so I may, perchance, by laughter and jollity relieve\r\nin some degree your souls that are heavy laden with pity for the death of\r\nGhismonda.\r\n\r\nKnow then, noble ladies, that there was in Imola a man of evil and corrupt\r\nlife, Berto della Massa by name, whose pestilent practices came at length to\r\nbe so well known to the good folk of Imola that 'twas all one whether he\r\nlied or spoke the truth, for there was not a soul in Imola that believed a\r\nword he said: wherefore, seeing that his tricks would pass no longer there,\r\nhe removed, as in despair, to Venice, that common sink of all abominations,\r\nthinking there to find other means than he had found elsewhere to the\r\nprosecution of his nefarious designs. And, as if conscience-stricken for his\r\npast misdeeds, he assumed an air of the deepest humility, turned the best\r\nCatholic of them all, and went and made himself a friar minor, taking the\r\nname of Fra Alberto da Imola. With his habit he put on a shew of austerity,\r\nhighly commending penitence and abstinence, and eating or drinking no sort\r\nof meat or wine but such as was to his taste. And scarce a soul was there\r\nthat wist that the thief, the pimp, the cheat, the assassin, had not been\r\nsuddenly converted into a great preacher without continuing in the practice\r\nof the said iniquities, whensoever the same was privily possible. And\r\nwithal, having got himself made priest, as often as he celebrated at the\r\naltar, he would weep over the passion of our Lord, so there were folk in\r\nplenty to see, for tears cost him little enough, when he had a mind to shed\r\nthem. In short, what with his sermons and his tears, he duped the folk of\r\nVenice to such a tune that scarce a will was there made but he was its\r\nexecutor and depositary; nay, not a few made him trustee of their moneys,\r\nand most, or well-nigh most, men and women alike, their confessor and\r\ncounsellor: in short, he had put off the wolf and put on the shepherd, and\r\nthe fame of his holiness was such in those parts that St. Francis himself\r\nhad never the like at Assisi.\r\n\r\nNow it so befell that among the ladies that came to confess to this holy\r\nfriar was one Monna Lisetta of Ca' Quirino, the young, silly, empty-headed\r\nwife of a great merchant, who was gone with the galleys to Flanders. Like a\r\nVenetian--for unstable are they all--though she placed herself at his feet,\r\nshe told him but a part of her sins, and when Fra Alberto asked her whether\r\nshe had a lover, she replied with black looks:--\"How now, master friar? have\r\nyou not eyes in your head? See you no difference between my charms and those\r\nof other women? Lovers in plenty might I have, so I would: but charms such\r\nas mine must not be cheapened: 'tis not every man that might presume to love\r\nme. How many ladies have you seen whose beauty is comparable to mine? I\r\nshould adorn Paradise itself.\" Whereto she added so much more in praise of\r\nher beauty that the friar could scarce hear her with patience. Howbeit,\r\ndiscerning at a glance that she was none too well furnished with sense, he\r\ndeemed the soil meet for his plough, and fell forthwith inordinately in love\r\nwith her, though he deferred his blandishments to a more convenient season,\r\nand by way of supporting his character for holiness began instead to chide\r\nher, telling her (among other novelties) that this was vainglory: whereto\r\nthe lady retorted that he was a blockhead, and could not distinguish one\r\ndegree of beauty from another. Wherefore Fra Alberto, lest he should\r\noccasion her too much chagrin, cut short the confession, and suffered her to\r\ndepart with the other ladies. Some days after, accompanied by a single\r\ntrusty friend, he hied him to Monna Lisetta's house, and having withdrawn\r\nwith her alone into a saloon, where they were safe from observation, he fell\r\non his knees at her feet, and said:--\"Madam, for the love of God I crave\r\nyour pardon of that which I said to you on Sunday, when you spoke to me of\r\nyour beauty, for so grievously was I chastised therefor that very night,\r\nthat 'tis but to-day that I have been able to quit my bed.\" \"And by whom,\"\r\nquoth my Lady Battledore, \"were you so chastised?\" \"I will tell you,\"\r\nreturned Fra Alberto. \"That night I was, as is ever my wont, at my orisons,\r\nwhen suddenly a great light shone in my cell, and before I could turn me to\r\nsee what it was, I saw standing over me a right goodly youth with a stout\r\ncudgel in his hand, who seized me by the habit and threw me at his feet and\r\nbelaboured me till I was bruised from head to foot. And when I asked him why\r\nhe used me thus, he answered:--''Tis because thou didst to-day presume to\r\nspeak slightingly of the celestial charms of Monna Lisetta, whom I love next\r\nto God Himself.' Whereupon I asked:--'And who are you?' And he made answer\r\nthat he was the Angel Gabriel. Then said I:--'O my lord, I pray you pardon\r\nme.' Whereto he answered:--'I pardon thee on condition that thou go to her,\r\nwith what speed thou mayst, and obtain her pardon, which if she accord thee\r\nnot, I shall come back hither and give thee belabourings enough with my\r\ncudgel to make thee a sad man for the rest of thy days.' What more he said,\r\nI dare not tell you, unless you first pardon me.\" Whereat our flimsy\r\npumpion-pated Lady Lackbrain was overjoyed, taking all the friar's words for\r\ngospel. So after a while she said:--\"And did I not tell you, Fra Alberto,\r\nthat my charms were celestial? But, so help me God, I am moved to pity of\r\nyou, and forthwith I pardon you, lest worse should befall you, so only you\r\ntell me what more the Angel said.\" \"So will I gladly, Madam,\" returned Fra\r\nAlberto, \"now that I have your pardon; this only I bid you bear in mind,\r\nthat you have a care that never a soul in the world hear from you a single\r\nword of what I shall say to you, if you would not spoil your good fortune,\r\nwherein there is not to-day in the whole world a lady that may compare with\r\nyou. Know then that the Angel Gabriel bade me tell you that you stand so\r\nhigh in his favour that again and again he would have come to pass the night\r\nwith you, but that he doubted he should affright you. So now he sends you\r\nword through me that he would fain come one night, and stay a while with\r\nyou; and seeing that, being an angel, if he should visit you in his angelic\r\nshape, he might not be touched by you, he would, to pleasure you, present\r\nhimself in human shape; and so he bids you send him word, when you would\r\nhave him come, and in whose shape, and he will come; for which cause you may\r\ndeem yourself more blessed than any other lady that lives.\" My Lady Vanity\r\nthen said that she was highly flattered to be beloved of the Angel Gabriel;\r\nwhom she herself loved so well that she had never grudged four soldi to burn\r\na candle before his picture, wherever she saw it, and that he was welcome to\r\nvisit her as often as he liked, and would always find her alone in her room;\r\non the understanding, however, that he should not desert her for the Virgin\r\nMary, whom she had heard he did mightily affect, and indeed 'twould so\r\nappear, for, wherever she saw him, he was always on his knees at her feet:\r\nfor the rest he might even come in what shape he pleased, so that it was not\r\nsuch as to terrify her. Then said Fra Alberto:--\"Madam, 'tis wisely spoken;\r\nand I will arrange it all with him just as you say. But 'tis in your power\r\nto do me a great favour, which will cost you nothing; and this favour is\r\nthat you be consenting that he visit you in my shape. Now hear wherein you\r\nwill confer this favour: thus will it be: he will disembody my soul, and set\r\nit in Paradise, entering himself into my body; and, as long as he shall be\r\nwith you, my soul will be in Paradise.\" Whereto my Lady Slenderwit:--\"So be\r\nit,\" she said; \"I am well pleased that you have this solace to salve the\r\nbruises that he gives you on my account.\" \"Good,\" said Fra Alberto; \"then\r\nyou will see to it that to-night he find, when he comes, your outer door\r\nunlatched, that he may have ingress; for, coming, as he will, in human\r\nshape, he will not be able to enter save by the door.\" \"It shall be done,\"\r\nreplied the lady. Whereupon Fra Alberto took his leave, and the lady\r\nremained in such a state of exaltation that her nether end knew not her\r\nchemise, and it seemed to her a thousand years until the Angel Gabriel\r\nshould come to visit her. Fra Alberto, bethinking him that 'twas not as an\r\nangel, but as a cavalier that he must acquit himself that night, fell to\r\nfortifying himself with comfits and other dainties, that he might not lose\r\nhis saddle for slight cause. Then, leave of absence gotten, he betook him at\r\nnightfall, with a single companion, to the house of a woman that was his\r\nfriend, which house had served on former occasions as his base when he went\r\na chasing the fillies; and having there disguised himself, he hied him, when\r\nhe deemed 'twas time, to the house of the lady, where, donning the gewgaws\r\nhe had brought with him, he transformed himself into an angel, and going up,\r\nentered the lady's chamber. No sooner saw she this dazzling apparition than\r\nshe fell on her knees before the Angel, who gave her his blessing, raised\r\nher to her feet, and motioned her to go to bed. She, nothing loath, obeyed\r\nforthwith, and the Angel lay down beside his devotee. Now, Fra Alberto was a\r\nstout, handsome fellow, whose legs bore themselves right bravely; and being\r\nbedded with Monna Lisetta, who was lusty and delicate, he covered her after\r\nanother fashion than her husband had been wont, and took many a flight that\r\nnight without wings, so that she heartily cried him content; and not a\r\nlittle therewithal did he tell her of the glory celestial. Then towards\r\ndaybreak, all being ready for his return, he hied him forth, and repaired,\r\ncaparisoned as he was, to his friend, whom, lest he should be affrighted,\r\nsleeping alone, the good woman of the house had solaced with her company.\r\nThe lady, so soon as she had breakfasted, betook her to Fra Alberto, and\r\nreported the Angel Gabriel's visit, and what he had told her of the glory of\r\nthe life eternal, describing his appearance, not without some added marvels\r\nof her own invention. Whereto Fra Alberto replied:--\"Madam, I know not how\r\nyou fared with him; but this I know, that last night he came to me, and for\r\nthat I had done his errand with you, he suddenly transported my soul among\r\nsuch a multitude of flowers and roses as was never seen here below, and my\r\nsoul--what became of my body I know not--tarried in one of the most\r\ndelightful places that ever was from that hour until matins.\" \"As for your\r\nbody,\" said the lady, \"do I not tell you whose it was? It lay all night long\r\nwith the Angel Gabriel in my arms; and if you believe me not, you have but\r\nto took under your left pap, where I gave the Angel a mighty kiss, of which\r\nthe mark will last for some days.\" \"Why then,\" said Fra Alberto, \"I will\r\neven do to-day what 'tis long since I did, to wit, undress, that I may see\r\nif you say sooth.\" So they fooled it a long while, and then the lady went\r\nhome, where Fra Alberto afterwards paid her many a visit without any let.\r\nHowever, one day it so befell that while Monna Lisetta was with one of her\r\ngossips canvassing beauties, she, being minded to exalt her own charms above\r\nall others, and having, as we know, none too much wit in her pumpion-pate,\r\nobserved:--\"Did you but know by whom my charms are prized, then, for sure,\r\nyou would have nought to say of the rest.\" Her gossip, all agog to hear, for\r\nwell she knew her foible, answered:--\"Madam, it may be as you say, but\r\nstill, while one knows not who he may be, one cannot alter one's mind so\r\nrapidly.\" Whereupon my Lady Featherbrain:--\"Gossip,\" said she, \"'tis not for\r\ncommon talk, but he that I wot of is the Angel Gabriel, who loves me more\r\ndearly than himself, for that I am, so he tells me, the fairest lady in all\r\nthe world, ay, and in the Maremma to boot.\"(2) Whereat her gossip would fain\r\nhave laughed, but held herself in, being minded to hear more from her.\r\nWherefore she said:--\"God's faith, Madam, if 'tis the Angel Gabriel, and he\r\ntells you so, why, so of course it must needs be; but I wist not the angels\r\nmeddled with such matters.\" \"There you erred, gossip,\" said the lady:\r\n\"zounds, he does it better than my husband, and he tells me they do it above\r\nthere too, but, as he rates my charms above any that are in heaven, he is\r\nenamoured of me, and not seldom visits me: so now dost see?\" So away went\r\nthe gossip so agog to tell the story, that it seemed to her a thousand years\r\ntill she was where it might be done; and being met for recreation with a\r\ngreat company of ladies, she narrated it all in detail: whereby it passed to\r\nthe ladies' husbands, and to other ladies, and from them to yet other\r\nladies, so that in less than two days all Venice was full of it. But among\r\nothers, whose ears it reached, were Monna Lisetta's brothers-in-law, who,\r\nkeeping their own counsel, resolved to find this angel and make out whether\r\nhe knew how to fly; to which end they kept watch for some nights. Whereof no\r\nhint, as it happened, reached Fra Alberto's ears; and so, one night when he\r\nwas come to enjoy the lady once more, he was scarce undressed when her\r\nbrothers-in-law, who had seen him come, were at the door of the room and\r\nalready opening it, when Fra Alberto, hearing the noise and apprehending the\r\ndanger, started up, and having no other resource, threw open a window that\r\nlooked on to the Grand Canal, and plunged into the water. The depth was\r\ngreat, and he was an expert swimmer; so that he took no hurt, but, having\r\nreached the other bank, found a house open, and forthwith entered it,\r\npraying the good man that was within, for God's sake to save his life, and\r\ntrumping up a story to account for his being there at so late an hour, and\r\nstripped to the skin. The good man took pity on him, and having occasion to\r\ngo out, he put him in his own bed, bidding him stay there until his return;\r\nand so, having locked him in, he went about his business.\r\n\r\nNow when the lady's brothers-in-law entered the room, and found that the\r\nAngel Gabriel had taken flight, leaving his wings behind him, being baulked\r\nof their prey, they roundly rated the lady, and then, leaving her\r\ndisconsolate, betook themselves home with the Angel's spoils. Whereby it\r\nbefell, that, when 'twas broad day, the good man, being on the Rialto, heard\r\ntell how the Angel Gabriel had come to pass the night with Monna Lisetta,\r\nand, being surprised by her brothers-in-law, had taken fright, and thrown\r\nhimself into the Canal, and none knew what was become of him. The good man\r\nguessed in a trice that the said Angel was no other than the man he had at\r\nhome, whom on his return he recognized, and, after much chaffering, brought\r\nhim to promise him fifty ducats that he might not be given up to the lady's\r\nbrothers-in-law. The bargain struck, Fra Alberto signified a desire to be\r\ngoing. Whereupon:--\"There is no way,\" said the good man, \"but one, if you\r\nare minded to take it. To-day we hold a revel, wherein folk lead others\r\nabout in various disguises; as, one man will present a bear, another a wild\r\nman, and so forth; and then in the piazza of San Marco there is a hunt,\r\nwhich done, the revel is ended; and then away they hie them, whither they\r\nwill, each with the man he has led about. If you are willing to be led by me\r\nin one or another of these disguises, before it can get wind that you are\r\nhere, I can bring you whither you would go; otherwise I see not how you are\r\nto quit this place without being known; and the lady's brothers-in-law,\r\nreckoning that you must be lurking somewhere in this quarter, have set\r\nguards all about to take you.\" Loath indeed was Fra Alberto to go in such a\r\nguise, but such was his fear of the lady's relations that he consented, and\r\ntold the good man whither he desired to be taken, and that he was content to\r\nleave the choice of the disguise to him. The good man then smeared him all\r\nover with honey, and covered him with down, set a chain on his neck and a\r\nvizard on his face, gave him a stout cudgel to carry in one hand, and two\r\nhuge dogs, which he had brought from the shambles, to lead with the other,\r\nand sent a man to the Rialto to announce that whoso would see the Angel\r\nGabriel should hie him to the piazza of San Marco; in all which he acted as\r\na leal Venetian. And so, after a while, he led him forth, and then, making\r\nhim go before, held him by the chain behind, and through a great throng that\r\nclamoured:--\"What manner of thing is this? what manner of thing is this?\" he\r\nbrought him to the piazza, where, what with those that followed them, and\r\nthose that had come from the Rialto on hearing the announcement, there were\r\nfolk without end. Arrived at the piazza, he fastened his wild man to a\r\ncolumn in a high and exposed place, making as if he were minded to wait till\r\nthe hunt should begin; whereby the flies and gadflies, attracted by the\r\nhoney with which he was smeared, caused him most grievous distress. However,\r\nthe good man waited only until the piazza was thronged, and then, making as\r\nif he would unchain his wild man, he tore the vizard from Fra Alberto's\r\nface, saying:--\"Gentlemen, as the boar comes not to the hunt, and the hunt\r\ndoes not take place, that it be not for nothing that you are come hither, I\r\nam minded to give you a view of the Angel Gabriel, who comes down from\r\nheaven to earth by night to solace the ladies of Venice.\" The vizard was no\r\nsooner withdrawn than all recognized Fra Alberto, and greeted him with\r\nhootings, rating him in language as offensive and opprobrious as ever rogue\r\nwas abused withal, and pelting him in the face with every sort of filth that\r\ncame to hand: in which plight they kept him an exceeding great while, until\r\nby chance the bruit thereof reached his brethren, of whom some six thereupon\r\nput themselves in motion, and, arrived at the piazza, clapped a habit on his\r\nback, and unchained him, and amid an immense uproar led him off to their\r\nconvent, where, after languishing a while in prison, 'tis believed that he\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nSo this man, by reason that, being reputed righteous, he did evil, and 'twas\r\nnot imputed to him, presumed to counterfeit the Angel Gabriel, and, being\r\ntransformed into a wild man, was in the end put to shame, as he deserved,\r\nand vainly bewailed his misdeeds. God grant that so it may betide all his\r\nlikes.\r\n\r\n(1) de' maggior cassesi. No such word as cassesi is known to the\r\nlexicographers or commentators; and no plausible emendation has yet been\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n(2) With this ineptitude cf. the friar's \"flowers and roses \" on the\r\npreceding page.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL III.\r\n\r\n--\r\nThree young men love three sisters, and flee with them to Crete. The eldest\r\nof the sisters slays her lover for jealousy. The second saves the life of\r\nthe first by yielding herself to the Duke of Crete. Her lover slays her, and\r\nmakes off with the first: the third sister and her lover are charged with\r\nthe murder, are arrested and confess the crime. They escape death by bribing\r\nthe guards, flee destitute to Rhodes, and there in destitution die.\r\n--\r\n\r\nPampinea's story ended, Filostrato mused a while, and then said to her:--\"A\r\nlittle good matter there was that pleased me at the close of your story,\r\nbut, before 'twas reached, there was far too much to laugh at, which I could\r\nhave wished had not been there.\" Then, turning to Lauretta, he said:--\r\n\"Madam, give us something better to follow, if so it may be.\" Lauretta\r\nreplied with a laugh:--\"Harsh beyond measure are you to the lovers, to\r\ndesire that their end be always evil; but, as in duty bound, I will tell a\r\nstory of three, who all alike came to a bad end, having had little joyance\r\nof their loves;\" and so saying, she began.\r\n\r\nWell may ye wot, young ladies, for 'tis abundantly manifest, that there is\r\nno vice but most grievous disaster may ensue thereon to him that practises\r\nit, and not seldom to others; and of all the vices that which hurries us\r\ninto peril with loosest rein is, methinks, anger; which is nought but a rash\r\nand hasty impulse, prompted by a feeling of pain, which banishes reason,\r\nshrouds the eyes of the mind in thick darkness, and sets the soul ablaze\r\nwith a fierce frenzy. Which, though it not seldom befall men, and one rather\r\nthan another, has nevertheless been observed to be fraught in women with\r\nmore disastrous consequences, inasmuch as in them the flame is both more\r\nreadily kindled, and burns more brightly, and with less impediment to its\r\nvehemence. Wherein is no cause to marvel, for, if we consider it, we shall\r\nsee that 'tis of the nature of fire to lay hold more readily of things light\r\nand delicate than of matters of firmer and more solid substance; and sure it\r\nis that we (without offence to the men be it spoken) are more delicate than\r\nthey, and much more mobile. Wherefore, seeing how prone we are thereto by\r\nnature, and considering also our gentleness and tenderness, how soothing and\r\nconsolatory they are to the men with whom we consort, and that thus this\r\nmadness of wrath is fraught with grievous annoy and peril; therefore, that\r\nwith stouter heart we may defend ourselves against it, I purpose by my story\r\nto shew you, how the loves of three young men, and as many ladies, as I said\r\nbefore, were by the anger of one of the ladies changed from a happy to a\r\nmost woeful complexion.\r\n\r\nMarseilles, as you know, is situate on the coast of Provence, a city ancient\r\nand most famous, and in old time the seat of many more rich men and great\r\nmerchants than are to be seen there to-day, among whom was one Narnald\r\nCluada by name, a man of the lowest origin, but a merchant of unsullied\r\nprobity and integrity, and boundless wealth in lands and goods and money,\r\nwho had by his lady several children, three of them being daughters, older,\r\neach of them, than the other children, who were sons. Two of the daughters,\r\nwho were twins, were, when my story begins, fifteen years old, and the third\r\nwas but a year younger, so that in order to their marriage their kinsfolk\r\nawaited nothing but the return of Narnald from Spain, whither he was gone\r\nwith his merchandise. One of the twins was called Ninette, the other\r\nMadeleine; the third daughter's name was Bertelle. A young man, Restagnon by\r\nname, who, though poor, was of gentle blood, was in the last degree\r\nenamoured of Ninette, and she of him; and so discreetly had they managed the\r\naffair, that, never another soul in the world witting aught of it, they had\r\nhad joyance of their love, and that for a good while, when it so befell that\r\ntwo young friends of theirs, the one Foulques, the other Hugues by name,\r\nwhom their fathers, recently dead, had left very wealthy, fell in love, the\r\none with Madeleine, the other with Bertelle. Whereof Restagnon being\r\napprised by Ninette bethought him that in their love he might find a means\r\nto the relief of his necessities. He accordingly consorted freely and\r\nfamiliarly with them, accompanying, now one, now the other, and sometimes\r\nboth of them, when they went to visit their ladies and his; and when he\r\njudged that he had made his footing as friendly and familiar as need was, he\r\nbade them one day to his house, and said:--\"Comrades most dear, our\r\nfriendship, perchance, may not have left you without assurance of the great\r\nlove I bear you, and that for you I would do even as much as for myself:\r\nwherefore, loving you thus much, I purpose to impart to you that which is in\r\nmy mind, that in regard thereof, you and I together may then resolve in such\r\nsort as to you shall seem the best. You, if I may trust your words, as also\r\nwhat I seem to have gathered from your demeanour by day and by night, burn\r\nwith an exceeding great love for the two ladies whom you affect, as I for\r\ntheir sister. For the assuagement whereof, I have good hope that, if you\r\nwill unite with me, I shall find means most sweet and delightsome; to wit,\r\non this wise. You possess, as I do not, great wealth: now if you are willing\r\nto make of your wealth a common stock with me as third partner therein, and\r\nto choose some part of the world where we may live in careless ease upon our\r\nsubstance, without any manner of doubt I trust so to prevail that the three\r\nsisters with great part of their father's substance shall come to live with\r\nus, wherever we shall see fit to go; whereby, each with his own lady, we\r\nshall live as three brethren, the happiest men in the world. 'Tis now for\r\nyou to determine whether you will embrace this proffered solace, or let it\r\nslip from you.\" The two young men, whose love was beyond all measure\r\nfervent, spared themselves the trouble of deliberation: 'twas enough that\r\nthey heard that they were to have their ladies: wherefore they answered,\r\nthat, so this should ensue, they were ready to do as he proposed. Having\r\nthus their answer, Restagnon a few days later was closeted with Ninette, to\r\nwhom 'twas a matter of no small difficulty for him to get access. Nor had he\r\nbeen long with her before he adverted to what had passed between him and the\r\nyoung men, and sought to commend the project to her for reasons not a few.\r\nLittle need, however, had he to urge her: for to live their life openly\r\ntogether was the very thing she desired, far more than he: wherefore she\r\nfrankly answered that she would have it so, that her sisters would do, more\r\nespecially in this matter, just as she wished, and that he should lose no\r\ntime in making all the needful arrangements. So Restagnon returned to the\r\ntwo young men, who were most urgent that it should be done even as he said,\r\nand told them that on the part of the ladies the matter was concluded. And\r\nso, having fixed upon Crete for their destination, and sold some estates\r\nthat they had, giving out that they were minded to go a trading with the\r\nproceeds, they converted all else that they possessed into money, and bought\r\na brigantine, which with all secrecy they handsomely equipped, anxiously\r\nexpecting the time of their departure, while Ninette on her part, knowing\r\nwell how her sisters were affected, did so by sweet converse foment their\r\ndesire that, till it should be accomplished, they accounted their life as\r\nnought. The night of their embarcation being come, the three sisters opened\r\na great chest that belonged to their father, and took out therefrom a vast\r\nquantity of money and jewels, with which they all three issued forth of the\r\nhouse in dead silence, as they had been charged, and found their three\r\nlovers awaiting them; who, having forthwith brought them aboard the\r\nbrigantine, bade the rowers give way, and, tarrying nowhere, arrived the\r\nnext evening at Genoa, where the new lovers had for the first time joyance\r\nand solace of their love.\r\n\r\nHaving taken what they needed of refreshment, they resumed their course,\r\ntouching at this port and that, and in less than eight days, speeding\r\nwithout impediment, were come to Crete. There they bought them domains both\r\nbeautiful and broad, whereon, hard by Candia they built them mansions most\r\ngoodly and delightsome, wherein they lived as barons, keeping a crowd of\r\nretainers, with dogs, hawks and horses, and speeding the time with their\r\nladies in feasting and revelling and merrymaking, none so light-hearted as\r\nthey. Such being the tenor of their life, it so befell that (as 'tis matter\r\nof daily experience that, however delightsome a thing may be, superabundance\r\nthereof will breed disgust) Restagnon, much as he had loved Ninette, being\r\nnow able to have his joyance of her without stint or restraint, began to\r\nweary of her, and by consequence to abate somewhat of his love for her. And\r\nbeing mightily pleased with a fair gentlewoman of the country, whom he met\r\nat a merrymaking, he set his whole heart upon her, and began to shew himself\r\nmarvellously courteous and gallant towards her; which Ninette perceiving\r\ngrew so jealous that he might not go a step but she knew of it, and resented\r\nit to his torment and her own with high words. But as, while superfluity\r\nengenders disgust, appetite is but whetted when fruit is forbidden, so\r\nNinette's wrath added fuel to the flame of Restagnon's new love. And\r\nwhichever was the event, whether in course of time Restagnon had the lady's\r\nfavour or had it not, Ninette, whoever may have brought her the tidings,\r\nfirmly believed that he had it; whereby from the depths of distress she\r\npassed into a towering passion, and thus was transported into such a frenzy\r\nof rage that all the love she bore to Restagnon was converted into bitter\r\nhatred, and, blinded by her wrath, she made up her mind to avenge by\r\nRestagnon's death the dishonour which she deemed that he had done her. So\r\nshe had recourse to an old Greek woman, that was very skilful in compounding\r\npoisons, whom by promises and gifts she induced to distill a deadly water,\r\nwhich, keeping her own counsel, she herself gave Restagnon to drink one\r\nevening, when he was somewhat heated and quite off his guard: whereby--such\r\nwas the efficacy of the water--she despatched Restagnon before matins. On\r\nlearning his death Foulques and Hugues and their ladies, who knew not that\r\nhe had been poisoned, united their bitter with Ninette's feigned\r\nlamentations, and gave him honourable sepulture. But so it befell that, not\r\nmany days after, the old woman, that had compounded the poison for Ninette,\r\nwas taken for another crime; and, being put to the torture, confessed the\r\ncompounding of the poison among other of her misdeeds, and fully declared\r\nwhat had thereby come to pass. Wherefore the Duke of Crete, breathing no\r\nword of his intent, came privily by night, and set a guard around Foulques'\r\npalace, where Ninette then was, and quietly, and quite unopposed, took and\r\ncarried her off; and without putting her to the torture, learned from her in\r\na trice all that he sought to know touching the death of Restagnon. Foulques\r\nand Hugues had learned privily of the Duke, and their ladies of them, for\r\nwhat cause Ninette was taken; and, being mightily distressed thereby,\r\nbestirred themselves with all zeal to save Ninette from the fire, to which\r\nthey apprehended she would be condemned, as having indeed richly deserved\r\nit; but all their endeavours seemed to avail nothing, for the Duke was\r\nunwaveringly resolved that justice should be done. Madeleine, Foulques' fair\r\nwife, who had long been courted by the Duke, but had never deigned to shew\r\nhim the least favour, thinking that by yielding herself to his will she\r\nmight redeem her sister from the fire, despatched a trusty envoy to him with\r\nthe intimation that she was entirely at his disposal upon the twofold\r\ncondition, that in the first place her sister should be restored to her free\r\nand scatheless, and, in the second place, the affair should be kept secret.\r\nAlbeit gratified by this overture, the Duke was long in doubt whether he\r\nshould accept it; in the end, however, he made up his mind to do so, and\r\nsignified his approval to the envoy. Then with the lady's consent he put\r\nFoulques and Hugues under arrest for a night, as if he were minded to\r\nexamine them of the affair, and meanwhile quartered himself privily with\r\nMadeleine. Ninette, who, he had made believe, had been set in a sack, and\r\nwas to be sunk in the sea that same night, he took with him, and presented\r\nher to her sister in requital of the night's joyance, which, as he parted\r\nfrom her on the morrow, he prayed her might not be the last, as it was the\r\nfirst, fruit of their love, at the same time enjoining her to send the\r\nguilty lady away that she might not bring reproach upon him, nor he be\r\ncompelled to deal rigorously with her again. Released the same morning, and\r\ntold that Ninette had been cast into the sea, Foulques and Hugues, fully\r\nbelieving that so it was, came home, thinking how they should console their\r\nladies for the death of their sister; but, though Madeleine was at great\r\npains to conceal Ninette, Foulques nevertheless, to his no small amazement,\r\ndiscovered that she was there; which at once excited his suspicion, for he\r\nknew that the Duke had been enamoured of Madeleine; and he asked how it was\r\nthat Ninette was there. Madeleine made up a long story by way of\r\nexplanation, to which his sagacity gave little credit, and in the end after\r\nlong parley he constrained her to tell the truth. Whereupon, overcome with\r\ngrief, and transported with rage, he drew his sword, and, deaf to her\r\nappeals for mercy, slew her. Then, fearing the vengeful justice of the Duke,\r\nhe left the dead body in the room, and hied him to Ninette, and with a\r\ncounterfeit gladsome mien said to her:--\"Go we without delay whither thy\r\nsister has appointed that I escort thee, that thou fall not again into the\r\nhands of the Duke.\" Ninette believed him, and being fain to go for very\r\nfear, she forewent further leave-taking of her sister, more particularly as\r\nit was now night, and set out with Foulques, who took with him such little\r\nmoney as he could lay his hands upon; and so they made their way to the\r\ncoast, where they got aboard a bark, but none ever knew where their voyage\r\nended.\r\n\r\nMadeleine's dead body being discovered next day, certain evil-disposed folk,\r\nthat bore a grudge to Hugues, forthwith apprised the Duke of the fact; which\r\nbrought the Duke--for much he loved Madeleine--in hot haste to the house,\r\nwhere he arrested Hugues and his lady, who as yet knew nothing of the\r\ndeparture of Foulques and Ninette, and extorted from them a confession that\r\nthey and Foulques were jointly answerable for Madeleine's death. For which\r\ncause being justly apprehensive of death, they with great address corrupted\r\nthe guards that had charge of them, giving them a sum of money which they\r\nkept concealed in their house against occasions of need; and together with\r\nthe guards fled with all speed, leaving all that they possessed behind them,\r\nand took ship by night for Rhodes, where, being arrived, they lived in great\r\npoverty and misery no long time. Such then was the issue, to which\r\nRestagnon, by his foolish love, and Ninette by her wrath brought themselves\r\nand others.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL IV.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGerbino, in breach of the plighted faith of his grandfather, King Guglielmo,\r\nattacks a ship of the King of Tunis to rescue thence his daughter. She being\r\nslain by those aboard the ship, he slays them, and afterwards he is\r\nbeheaded.\r\n--\r\n\r\nLauretta, her story ended, kept silence; and the king brooded as in deep\r\nthought, while one or another of the company deplored the sad fate of this\r\nor the other of the lovers, or censured Ninette's wrath, or made some other\r\ncomment. At length, however, the king roused himself, and raising his head,\r\nmade sign to Elisa that 'twas now for her to speak. So, modestly, Elisa thus\r\nbegan:--Gracious ladies, not a few there are that believe that Love looses\r\nno shafts save when he is kindled by the eyes, contemning their opinion that\r\nhold that passion may be engendered by words; whose error will be abundantly\r\nmanifest in a story which I purpose to tell you; wherein you may see how\r\nmere rumour not only wrought mutual love in those that had never seen one\r\nanother, but also brought both to a miserable death.\r\n\r\nGuglielmo, the Second,(1) as the Sicilians compute, King of Sicily, had two\r\nchildren, a son named Ruggieri, and a daughter named Gostanza. Ruggieri died\r\nbefore his father, and left a son named Gerbino; who, being carefully\r\ntrained by his grandfather, grew up a most goodly gallant, and of great\r\nrenown in court and camp, and that not only within the borders of Sicily,\r\nbut in divers other parts of the world, among them Barbary, then tributary\r\nto the King of Sicily. And among others, to whose ears was wafted the bruit\r\nof Gerbino's magnificent prowess and courtesy, was a daughter of the King of\r\nTunis, who, by averment of all that had seen her, was a creature as fair and\r\ndebonair, and of as great and noble a spirit as Nature ever formed. To hear\r\ntell of brave men was her delight, and what she heard, now from one, now\r\nfrom another, of the brave deeds of Gerbino she treasured in her mind so\r\nsedulously, and pondered them with such pleasure, rehearsing them to herself\r\nin imagination, that she became hotly enamoured of him, and there was none\r\nof whom she talked, or heard others talk, so gladly. Nor, on the other hand,\r\nhad the fame of her incomparable beauty and other excellences failed to\r\ntravel, as to other lands, so also to Sicily, where, falling on Gerbino's\r\nears, it gave him no small delight, to such effect that he burned for the\r\nlady no less vehemently than she for him. Wherefore, until such time as he\r\nmight, upon some worthy occasion, have his grandfather's leave to go to\r\nTunis, yearning beyond measure to see her, he charged every friend of his,\r\nthat went thither, to give her to know, as best he might, his great and\r\nsecret love for her, and to bring him tidings of her. Which office one of\r\nthe said friends discharged with no small address; for, having obtained\r\naccess to her, after the manner of merchants, by bringing jewels for her to\r\nlook at, he fully apprised her of Gerbino's passion, and placed him, and all\r\nthat he possessed, entirely at her disposal. The lady received both\r\nmessenger and message with gladsome mien, made answer that she loved with\r\nequal ardour, and in token thereof sent Gerbino one of her most precious\r\njewels. Gerbino received the jewel with extreme delight, and sent her many a\r\nletter and many a most precious gift by the hand of the same messenger; and\r\n'twas well understood between them that, should Fortune accord him\r\nopportunity, he should see and know her.\r\n\r\nOn this footing the affair remained somewhat longer than was expedient; and\r\nso, while Gerbino and the lady burned with mutual love, it befell that the\r\nKing of Tunis gave her in marriage to the King of Granada;(2) whereat she\r\nwas wroth beyond measure, for that she was not only going into a country\r\nremote from her lover, but, as she deemed, was severed from him altogether;\r\nand so this might not come to pass, gladly, could she but have seen how,\r\nwould she have left her father and fled to Gerbino. In like manner, Gerbino,\r\non learning of the marriage, was vexed beyond measure, and was oft times\r\nminded, could he but find means to win to her husband by sea, to wrest her\r\nfrom him by force. Some rumour of Gerbino's love and of his intent, reached\r\nthe King of Tunis, who, knowing his prowess and power, took alarm, and as\r\nthe time drew nigh for conveying the lady to Granada, sent word of his\r\npurpose to King Guglielmo, and craved his assurance that it might be carried\r\ninto effect without let or hindrance on the part of Gerbino, or any one\r\nelse. The old King had heard nothing of Gerbino's love affair, and never\r\ndreaming that 'twas on such account that the assurance was craved, granted\r\nit without demur, and in pledge thereof sent the King of Tunis his glove.\r\nWhich received, the King made ready a great and goodly ship in the port of\r\nCarthage, and equipped her with all things meet for those that were to man\r\nher, and with all appointments apt and seemly for the reception of his\r\ndaughter, and awaited only fair weather to send her therein to Granada. All\r\nwhich the young lady seeing and marking, sent one of her servants privily to\r\nPalermo, bidding him greet the illustrious Gerbino on her part, and tell him\r\nthat a few days would see her on her way to Granada; wherefore 'twould now\r\nappear whether, or no, he were really as doughty a man as he was reputed,\r\nand loved her as much as he had so often protested. The servant did not fail\r\nto deliver her message exactly, and returned to Tunis, leaving Gerbino, who\r\nknew that his grandfather, King Guglielmo, had given the King of Tunis the\r\ndesired assurance, at a loss how to act. But prompted by love, and goaded by\r\nthe lady's words and loath to seem a craven, he hied him to Messina; and\r\nhaving there armed two light galleys, and manned them with good men and\r\ntrue, he put to sea, and stood for Sardinia, deeming that the lady's ship\r\nmust pass that way. Nor was he far out in his reckoning; for he had not been\r\nthere many days, when the ship, sped by a light breeze, hove in sight not\r\nfar from the place where he lay in wait for her. Whereupon Gerbino said to\r\nhis comrades:--\"Gentlemen, if you be as good men and true as I deem you,\r\nthere is none of you but must have felt, if he feel not now, the might of\r\nlove; for without love I deem no mortal capable of true worth or aught that\r\nis good; and if you are or have been in love, 'twill be easy for you to\r\nunderstand that which I desire. I love, and 'tis because I love that I have\r\nlaid this travail upon you; and that which I love is in the ship that you\r\nsee before you, which is fraught not only with my beloved, but with immense\r\ntreasures, which, if you are good men and true, we, so we but play the man\r\nin fight, may with little trouble make our own; nor for my share of the\r\nspoils of the victory demand I aught but a lady, whose love it is that\r\nprompts me to take arms: all else I freely cede to you from this very hour.\r\nForward, then; attack we this ship; success should be ours, for God favours\r\nour enterprise, nor lends her wind to evade us.\" Fewer words might have\r\nsufficed the illustrious Gerbino; for the rapacious Messinese that were with\r\nhim were already bent heart and soul upon that to which by his harangue he\r\nsought to animate them. So, when he had done, they raised a mighty shout, so\r\nthat 'twas as if trumpets did blare, and caught up their arms, and smiting\r\nthe water with their oars, overhauled the ship. The advancing galleys were\r\nobserved while they were yet a great way off by the ship's crew, who, not\r\nbeing able to avoid the combat, put themselves in a posture of defence.\r\nArrived at close quarters, the illustrious Gerbino bade send the ship's\r\nmasters aboard the galleys, unless they were minded to do battle. Certified\r\nof the challenge, and who they were that made it, the Saracens answered that\r\n'twas in breach of the faith plighted to them by their assailants' king that\r\nthey were thus attacked, and in token thereof displayed King Guglielmo's\r\nglove, averring in set terms that there should be no surrender either of\r\nthemselves or of aught that was aboard the ship without battle. Gerbino, who\r\nhad observed the lady standing on the ship's poop, and seen that she was far\r\nmore beautiful than he had imagined, burned with a yet fiercer flame than\r\nbefore, and to the display of the glove made answer, that, as he had no\r\nfalcons there just then, the glove booted him not; wherefore, so they were\r\nnot minded to surrender the lady, let them prepare to receive battle.\r\nWhereupon, without further delay, the battle began on both sides with a\r\nfurious discharge of arrows and stones; on which wise it was long protracted\r\nto their common loss; until at last Gerbino, seeing that he gained little\r\nadvantage, took a light bark which they had brought from Sardinia, and\r\nhaving fired her, bore down with her, and both the galleys, upon the ship.\r\nWhereupon the Saracens, seeing that they must perforce surrender the ship or\r\ndie, caused the King's daughter, who lay beneath the deck weeping, to come\r\nup on deck, and led her to the prow, and shouting to Gerbino, while the lady\r\nshrieked alternately \"mercy\" and \"succour,\" opened her veins before his\r\neyes, and cast her into the sea, saying:--\"Take her; we give her to thee on\r\nsuch wise as we can, and as thy faith has merited.\" Maddened to witness this\r\ndeed of barbarism, Gerbino, as if courting death, recked no more of the\r\narrows and the stones, but drew alongside the ship, and, despite the\r\nresistance of her crew, boarded her; and as a famished lion ravens amongst a\r\nherd of oxen, and tearing and rending, now one, now another, gluts his wrath\r\nbefore he appeases his hunger, so Gerbino, sword in hand, hacking and hewing\r\non all sides among the Saracens, did ruthlessly slaughter not a few of them;\r\ntill, as the burning ship began to blaze more fiercely, he bade the seamen\r\ntake thereout all that they might by way of guerdon, which done, he quitted\r\nher, having gained but a rueful victory over his adversaries. His next care\r\nwas to recover from the sea the body of the fair lady, whom long and with\r\nmany a tear he mourned: and so he returned to Sicily, and gave the body\r\nhonourable sepulture in Ustica, an islet that faces, as it were, Trapani,\r\nand went home the saddest man alive.\r\n\r\nWhen these tidings reached the King of Tunis, he sent to King Guglielmo\r\nambassadors, habited in black, who made complaint of the breach of faith and\r\nrecited the manner of its occurrence. Which caused King Guglielmo no small\r\nchagrin; and seeing not how he might refuse the justice they demanded, he\r\nhad Gerbino arrested, and he himself, none of his barons being able by any\r\nentreaty to turn him from his purpose, sentenced him to forfeit his head,\r\nand had it severed from his body in his presence, preferring to suffer the\r\nloss of his only grandson than to gain the reputation of a faithless king.\r\nAnd so, miserably, within the compass of a few brief days, died the two\r\nlovers by woeful deaths, as I have told you, and without having known any\r\njoyance of their love.\r\n\r\n(1) First, according to the now accepted reckoning. He reigned from 1154 to\r\n1166.\r\n\r\n(2) An anachronism; the Moorish kingdom of Granada not having been founded\r\nuntil 1238.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL V.\r\n\r\n--\r\nLisabetta's brothers slay her lover: he appears to her in a dream, and shews\r\nher where he is buried: she privily disinters the head, and sets it in a pot\r\nof basil, whereon she daily weeps a great while. The pot being taken from\r\nher by her brothers, she dies, not long after.\r\n--\r\n\r\nElisa's story ended, the king bestowed a few words of praise upon it, and\r\nthen laid the burden of discourse upon Filomena, who, full of compassion for\r\nthe woes of Gerbino and his lady, heaved a piteous sigh, and thus began:--My\r\nstory, gracious ladies, will not be of folk of so high a rank as those of\r\nwhom Elisa has told us, but perchance 'twill not be less touching. 'Tis\r\nbrought to my mind by the recent mention of Messina, where the matter\r\nbefell.\r\n\r\nKnow then that there were at Messina three young men, that were brothers and\r\nmerchants, who were left very rich on the death of their father, who was of\r\nSan Gimignano; and they had a sister, Lisabetta by name, a girl fair enough,\r\nand no less debonair, but whom, for some reason or another, they had not as\r\nyet bestowed in marriage. The three brothers had also in their shop a young\r\nPisan, Lorenzo by name, who managed all their affairs, and who was so goodly\r\nof person and gallant, that Lisabetta bestowed many a glance upon him, and\r\nbegan to regard him with extraordinary favour; which Lorenzo marking from\r\ntime to time, gave up all his other amours, and in like manner began to\r\naffect her, and so, their loves being equal, 'twas not long before they took\r\nheart of grace, and did that which each most desired. Wherein continuing to\r\ntheir no small mutual solace and delight, they neglected to order it with\r\ndue secrecy, whereby one night as Lisabetta was going to Lorenzo's room,\r\nshe, all unwitting, was observed by the eldest of the brothers, who, albeit\r\nmuch distressed by what he had learnt, yet, being a young man of discretion,\r\nwas swayed by considerations more seemly, and, allowing no word to escape\r\nhim, spent the night in turning the affair over in his mind in divers ways.\r\nOn the morrow he told his brothers that which, touching Lisabetta and\r\nLorenzo, he had observed in the night, which, that no shame might thence\r\nensue either to them or to their sister, they after long consultation\r\ndetermined to pass over in silence, making as if they had seen or heard\r\nnought thereof, until such time as they in a safe and convenient manner\r\nmight banish this disgrace from their sight before it could go further.\r\nAdhering to which purpose, they jested and laughed with Lorenzo as they had\r\nbeen wont; and after a while pretending that they were all three going forth\r\nof the city on pleasure, they took Lorenzo with them; and being come to a\r\nremote and very lonely spot, seeing that 'twas apt for their design, they\r\ntook Lorenzo, who was completely off his guard, and slew him, and buried him\r\non such wise that none was ware of it. On their return to Messina they gave\r\nout that they had sent him away on business; which was readily believed,\r\nbecause 'twas what they had been frequently used to do. But as Lorenzo did\r\nnot return, and Lisabetta questioned the brothers about him with great\r\nfrequency and urgency, being sorely grieved by his long absence, it so\r\nbefell that one day, when she was very pressing in her enquiries, one of the\r\nbrothers said:--\"What means this? What hast thou to do with Lorenzo, that\r\nthou shouldst ask about him so often? Ask us no more, or we will give thee\r\nsuch answer as thou deservest.\" So the girl, sick at heart and sorrowful,\r\nfearing she knew not what, asked no questions; but many a time at night she\r\ncalled piteously to him, and besought him to come to her, and bewailed his\r\nlong tarrying with many a tear, and ever yearning for his return, languished\r\nin total dejection.\r\n\r\nBut so it was that one night, when, after long weeping that her Lorenzo came\r\nnot back, she had at last fallen asleep, Lorenzo appeared to her in a dream,\r\nwan and in utter disarray, his clothes torn to shreds and sodden; and thus,\r\nas she thought, he spoke:--\"Lisabetta, thou dost nought but call me, and vex\r\nthyself for my long tarrying, and bitterly upbraid me with thy tears;\r\nwherefore be it known to thee that return to thee I may not, because the\r\nlast day that thou didst see me thy brothers slew me.\" After which, he\r\ndescribed the place where they had buried him, told her to call and expect\r\nhim no more, and vanished. The girl then awoke, and doubting not that the\r\nvision was true, wept bitterly. And when morning came, and she was risen,\r\nnot daring to say aught to her brothers, she resolved to go to the place\r\nindicated in the vision, and see if what she had dreamed were even as it had\r\nappeared to her. So, having leave to go a little way out of the city for\r\nrecreation in company with a maid that had at one time lived with them and\r\nknew all that she did, she hied her thither with all speed; and having\r\nremoved the dry leaves that were strewn about the place, she began to dig\r\nwhere the earth seemed least hard. Nor had she dug long, before she found\r\nthe body of her hapless lover, whereon as yet there was no trace of\r\ncorruption or decay; and thus she saw without any manner of doubt that her\r\nvision was true. And so, saddest of women, knowing that she might not bewail\r\nhim there, she would gladly, if she could, have carried away the body and\r\ngiven it more honourable sepulture elsewhere; but as she might not so do,\r\nshe took a knife, and, as best she could, severed the head from the trunk,\r\nand wrapped it in a napkin and laid it in the lap of her maid; and having\r\ncovered the rest of the corpse with earth, she left the spot, having been\r\nseen by none, and went home. There she shut herself up in her room with the\r\nhead, and kissed it a thousand times in every part, and wept long and\r\nbitterly over it, till she had bathed it in her tears. She then wrapped it\r\nin a piece of fine cloth, and set it in a large and beautiful pot of the\r\nsort in which marjoram or basil is planted, and covered it with earth, and\r\ntherein planted some roots of the goodliest basil of Salerno, and drenched\r\nthem only with her tears, or water perfumed with roses or orange-blossoms.\r\nAnd 'twas her wont ever to sit beside this pot, and, all her soul one\r\nyearning, to pore upon it, as that which enshrined her Lorenzo, and when\r\nlong time she had so done, she would bend over it, and weep a great while,\r\nuntil the basil was quite bathed in her tears.\r\n\r\nFostered with such constant, unremitting care, and nourished by the richness\r\ngiven to the soil by the decaying head that lay therein, the basil burgeoned\r\nout in exceeding great beauty and fragrance. And, the girl persevering ever\r\nin this way of life, the neighbours from time to time took note of it, and\r\nwhen her brothers marvelled to see her beauty ruined, and her eyes as it\r\nwere evanished from her head, they told them of it, saying:--\"We have\r\nobserved that such is her daily wont.\" Whereupon the brothers, marking her\r\nbehaviour, chid her therefore once or twice, and as she heeded them not,\r\ncaused the pot to be taken privily from her. Which, so soon as she missed\r\nit, she demanded with the utmost instance and insistence, and, as they gave\r\nit not back to her, ceased not to wail and weep, insomuch that she fell\r\nsick; nor in her sickness craved she aught but the pot of basil. Whereat the\r\nyoung men, marvelling mightily, resolved to see what the pot might contain;\r\nand having removed the earth they espied the cloth, and therein the head,\r\nwhich was not yet so decayed, but that by the curled locks they knew it for\r\nLorenzo's head. Passing strange they found it, and fearing lest it should be\r\nbruited abroad, they buried the head, and, with as little said as might be,\r\ntook order for their privy departure from Messina, and hied them thence to\r\nNaples. The girl ceased not to weep and crave her pot, and, so weeping,\r\ndied. Such was the end of her disastrous love; but not a few in course of\r\ntime coming to know the truth of the affair, there was one that made the\r\nsong that is still sung: to wit:--\r\n\r\nA thief he was, I swear,\r\nA sorry Christian he,\r\nThat took my basil of Salerno fair, etc.(1)\r\n\r\n(1) This Sicilian folk-song, of which Boccaccio quotes only the first two\r\nlines, is given in extenso from MS. Laurent. 38, plut. 42, by Fanfani in his\r\nedition of the Decameron (Florence, 1857). The following is a free\r\nrendering\u00b0\r\n\r\nA thief he was, I swear,\r\nA sorry Christian he,\r\nThat took my basil of Salerno fair,\r\nThat flourished mightily.\r\nPlanted by mine own hands with loving care\r\nWhat time they revelled free:\r\nTo spoil another's goods is churlish spite.\r\n\r\nTo spoil another's goods is churlish spite,\r\nAy, and most heinous sin.\r\nA basil had I (alas! luckless wight!),\r\nThe fairest plant: within\r\nIts shade I slept: 'twas grown to such a height.\r\nBut some folk for chagrin\r\n'Reft me thereof, ay, and before my door.\r\n\r\n'Reft me thereof, ay, and before my door.\r\nAh! dolorous day and drear!\r\nAh! woe is me! Would God I were no more!\r\nMy purchase was so dear!\r\nAh! why that day did I to watch give o'er?\r\nFor him my cherished fere\r\nWith marjoram I bordered it about.\r\n\r\nWith marjoram I bordered it about\r\nIn May-time fresh and fair,\r\nAnd watered it thrice ere each week was out,\r\nAnd marked it grow full yare:\r\nBut now 'tis stolen. Ah! too well 'tis known!(1)\r\n\r\nBut now 'tis stolen. Ah! too well 'tis known!\r\nThat no more may I hide:\r\nBut had to me a while before been shewn\r\nWhat then should me betide,\r\nAt night before my door I had laid me down\r\nTo watch my plant beside.\r\nYet God Almighty sure me succour might.\r\n\r\nAy, God Almighty sure me succour might,\r\nSo were it but His will,\r\n'Gainst him that me hath done so foul despite,\r\nThat in dire torment still\r\nI languish, since the thief reft from my sight\r\nMy plant that did me thrill,\r\nAnd to my inmost Soul such comfort lent!\r\n\r\nAnd to my inmost soul such comfort lent!\r\nSo fresh its fragrance blew,\r\nThat when, what time the sun uprose, I went\r\nMy watering to do,\r\nI'd hear the people all in wonderment\r\nSay, whence this perfume new?\r\nAnd I for love of it of grief shall die.\r\n\r\nAnd I for love of it of grief shall die,\r\nOf my fair plant for dole.\r\nWould one but shew me how I might it buy!\r\nAh! how 'twould me console!\r\nOunces(2) an hundred of fine gold have I:\r\nHim would I give the whole,\r\nAy, and a kiss to boot, so he were fain.\r\n\r\n(1) This stanza is defective in the original.\r\n\r\n(2) The \"oncia\" was a Sicilian gold coin worth rather more than a zecchino.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VI.\r\n\r\n--\r\nAndreuola loves Gabriotto: she tells him a dream that she has had; he tells\r\nher a dream of his own, and dies suddenly in her arms. While she and her\r\nmaid are carrying his corpse to his house, they are taken by the Signory.\r\nShe tells how the matter stands, is threatened with violence by the Podesta,\r\nbut will not brook it. Her father hears how she is bested; and, her\r\ninnocence being established, causes her to be set at large; but she, being\r\nminded to tarry no longer in the world, becomes a nun.\r\n--\r\n\r\nGlad indeed were the ladies to have heard Filomena's story, for that, often\r\nthough they had heard the song sung, they had never yet, for all their\r\nenquiries, been able to learn the occasion upon which it was made. When\r\n'twas ended, Pamfilo received the king's command to follow suit, and thus\r\nspoke:--By the dream told in the foregoing story I am prompted to relate one\r\nin which two dreams are told, dreams of that which was to come, as\r\nLisabetta's was of that which had been, and which were both fulfilled almost\r\nas soon as they were told by those that had dreamed them. Wherefore, loving\r\nladies, you must know that 'tis the common experience of mankind to have\r\ndivers visions during sleep; and albeit the sleeper, while he sleeps, deems\r\nall alike most true, but, being awake, judges some of them to be true,\r\nothers to be probable, and others again to be quite devoid of truth, yet not\r\na few are found to have come to pass. For which cause many are as sure of\r\nevery dream as of aught that they see in their waking hours, and so, as\r\ntheir dreams engender in them fear or hope, are sorrowful or joyous. And on\r\nthe other hand there are those that credit no dream, until they see\r\nthemselves fallen into the very peril whereof they were forewarned. Of whom\r\nI approve neither sort, for in sooth neither are all dreams true, nor all\r\nalike false. That they are not all true, there is none of us but may many a\r\ntime have proved; and that they are not all alike false has already been\r\nshewn in Filomena's story, and shall also, as I said before, be shewn in\r\nmine. Wherefore I deem that in a virtuous course of life and conduct there\r\nis no need to fear aught by reason of any dream that is contrary thereto, or\r\non that account to give up any just design; and as for crooked and sinister\r\nenterprises, however dreams may seem to favour them, and flatter the hopes\r\nof the dreamer with auspicious omens, none should trust them: rather should\r\nall give full credence to such as run counter thereto. But come we to the\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Brescia there lived of yore a gentleman named Messer Negro da\r\nPonte Carraro, who with other children had a very fair daughter, Andreuola\r\nby name, who, being unmarried, chanced to fall in love with a neighbour, one\r\nGabriotto, a man of low degree, but goodly of person and debonair, and\r\nendowed with all admirable qualities; and aided and abetted by the\r\nhousemaid, the girl not only brought it to pass that Gabriotto knew that he\r\nwas beloved of her, but that many a time to their mutual delight he came to\r\nsee her in a fair garden belonging to her father. And that nought but death\r\nmight avail to sever them from this their gladsome love, they became privily\r\nman and wife; and, while thus they continued their clandestine intercourse,\r\nit happened that one night, while the girl slept, she saw herself in a dream\r\nin her garden with Gabriotto, who to the exceeding great delight of both\r\nheld her in his arms; and while thus they lay, she saw issue from his body\r\nsomewhat dark and frightful, the shape whereof she might not discern; which,\r\nas she thought, laid hold of Gabriotto, and in her despite with prodigious\r\nforce reft him from her embrace, and bore him with it underground, so that\r\nboth were lost to her sight for evermore: whereby stricken with sore and\r\ninexpressible grief, she awoke; and albeit she was overjoyed to find that\r\n'twas not as she had dreamed, yet a haunting dread of what she had seen in\r\nher vision entered her soul. Wherefore, Gabriotto being minded to visit her\r\non the ensuing night, she did her best endeavour to dissuade him from\r\ncoming; but seeing that he was bent upon it, lest he should suspect\r\nsomewhat, she received him in her garden, where, having culled roses many,\r\nwhite and red--for 'twas summer--she sat herself down with him at the base\r\nof a most fair and lucent fountain. There long and joyously they dallied,\r\nand then Gabriotto asked her wherefore she had that day forbade his coming.\r\nWhereupon the lady told him her dream of the night before, and the doubt and\r\nfear which it had engendered in her mind. Whereat Gabriotto laughed, and\r\nsaid that 'twas the height of folly to put any faith in dreams, for that\r\nthey were occasioned by too much or too little food, and were daily seen to\r\nbe, one and all, things of nought, adding:--\"Were I minded to give heed to\r\ndreams, I should not be here now, for I, too, had a dream last night, which\r\nwas on this wise:--Methought I was in a fair and pleasant wood, and there, a\r\nhunting, caught a she-goat as beautiful and loveable as any that ever was\r\nseen, and, as it seemed to me, whiter than snow, which in a little while\r\ngrew so tame and friendly that she never stirred from my side. All the same\r\nso jealous was I lest she should leave me, that, meseemed, I had set a\r\ncollar of gold around her neck, and held her by a golden chain. And\r\npresently meseemed that, while the she-goat lay at rest with her head in my\r\nlap, there came forth, I knew not whence, a greyhound bitch, black as coal,\r\nfamished, and most fearsome to look upon; which made straight for me, and\r\nfor, meseemed, I offered no resistance, set her muzzle to my breast on the\r\nleft side and gnawed through to the heart, which, meseemed, she tore out to\r\ncarry away with her. Whereupon ensued so sore a pain that it brake my sleep,\r\nand as I awoke I laid my hand to my side to feel if aught were amiss there;\r\nbut finding nothing I laughed at myself that I had searched. But what\r\nsignifies it all? Visions of the like sort, ay, and far more appalling, have\r\nI had in plenty, and nought whatever, great or small, has come of any of\r\nthem. So let it pass, and think we how we may speed the time merrily.\"\r\n\r\nWhat she heard immensely enhanced the already great dread which her own\r\ndream had inspired in the girl; but, not to vex Gabriotto, she dissembled\r\nher terror as best she might. But, though she made great cheer, embracing\r\nand kissing him, and receiving his embraces and kisses, yet she felt a\r\ndoubt, she knew not why, and many a time, more than her wont, she would gaze\r\nupon his face, and ever and anon her glance would stray through the garden\r\nto see if any black creature were coming from any quarter. While thus they\r\npassed the time, of a sudden Gabriotto heaved a great sigh, and embracing\r\nher, said:--\"Alas! my soul, thy succour! for I die.\" And so saying, he fell\r\ndown upon the grassy mead. Whereupon the girl drew him to her, and laid him\r\non her lap, and all but wept, and said:--\"O sweet my lord, what is't that\r\nails thee?\" But Gabriotto was silent, and gasping sore for breath, and\r\nbathed in sweat, in no long time departed this life.\r\n\r\nHow grievous was the distress of the girl, who loved him more than herself,\r\nyou, my ladies, may well imagine. With many a tear she mourned him, and many\r\ntimes she vainly called him by his name; but when, having felt his body all\r\nover, and found it cold in every part, she could no longer doubt that he was\r\ndead, knowing not what to say or do, she went, tearful and woebegone, to\r\ncall the maid, to whom she had confided her love, and shewed her the woeful\r\ncalamity that had befallen her. Piteously a while they wept together over\r\nthe dead face of Gabriotto, and then the girl said to the maid:--\"Now that\r\nGod has reft him from me, I have no mind to linger in this life; but before\r\nI slay myself, I would we might find apt means to preserve my honour, and\r\nthe secret of our love, and to bury the body from which the sweet soul has\r\nfled.\" \"My daughter,\" said the maid, \"speak not of slaying thyself, for so\r\nwouldst thou lose in the other world, also, him that thou hast lost here;\r\nseeing that thou wouldst go to hell, whither, sure I am, his soul is not\r\ngone, for a good youth he was; far better were it to put on a cheerful\r\ncourage, and bethink thee to succour his soul with thy prayers or pious\r\nworks, if perchance he have need thereof by reason of any sin that he may\r\nhave committed. We can bury him readily enough in this garden, nor will any\r\none ever know; for none knows that he ever came hither; and if thou wilt not\r\nhave it so, we can bear him forth of the garden, and leave him there; and on\r\nthe morrow he will be found, and carried home, and buried by his kinsfolk.\"\r\nThe girl, heavy-laden though she was with anguish, and still weeping, yet\r\ngave ear to the counsels of her maid, and rejecting the former alternative,\r\nmade answer to the latter on this wise:--\"Now God forbid that a youth so\r\ndear, whom I have so loved and made my husband, should with my consent be\r\nburied like a dog, or left out there in the street. He has had my tears, and\r\nso far as I may avail, he shall have the tears of his kinsfolk, and already\r\nwot I what we must do.\" And forthwith she sent the maid for a piece of\r\nsilken cloth, which she had in one of her boxes; and when the maid returned\r\nwith it, they spread it on the ground, and laid Gabriotto's body thereon,\r\nresting the head upon a pillow. She then closed the eyes and mouth, shedding\r\nthe while many a tear, wove for him a wreath of roses, and strewed upon him\r\nall the roses that he and she had gathered; which done, she said to the\r\nmaid:--\"'Tis but a short way hence to the door of his house; so thither we\r\nwill bear him, thou and I, thus as we have dight him, and will lay him at\r\nthe door. Day will soon dawn, and they will take him up; and, though 'twill\r\nbe no consolation to them, I, in whose arms he died, shall be glad of it.\"\r\nSo saying, she burst once more into a torrent of tears, and fell with her\r\nface upon the face of the dead, and so long time she wept. Then, yielding at\r\nlast to the urgency of her maid, for day was drawing nigh, she arose, drew\r\nfrom her finger the ring with which she had been wedded to Gabriotto, and\r\nset it on his finger, saying with tears:--\"Dear my lord, if thy soul be\r\nwitness of my tears, or if, when the spirit is fled, aught of intelligence\r\nor sense still lurk in the body, graciously receive the last gift of her\r\nwhom in life thou didst so dearly love.\" Which said, she swooned, and fell\r\nupon the corpse; but, coming after a while to herself, she arose; and then\r\nshe and her maid took the cloth whereon the body lay, and so bearing it,\r\nquitted the garden, and bent their steps towards the dead man's house. As\r\nthus they went, it chanced that certain of the Podesta's guard, that for\r\nsome reason or another were abroad at that hour, met them, and arrested them\r\nwith the corpse. Andreuola, to whom death was more welcome than life, no\r\nsooner knew them for the officers of the Signory than she frankly said:--\"I\r\nknow you, who you are, and that flight would avail me nothing: I am ready to\r\ncome with you before the Signory, and to tell all there is to tell; but let\r\nnone of you presume to touch me, so long as I obey you, or to take away\r\naught that is on this body, if he would not that I accuse him.\" And so, none\r\nventuring to lay hand upon either her person or the corpse, she entered the\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the Podesta was apprised of the affair, he arose, had her brought\r\ninto his room, and there made himself conversant with the circumstances: and\r\ncertain physicians being charged to inquire whether the good man had met his\r\ndeath by poison or otherwise, all with one accord averred that 'twas not by\r\npoison, but that he was choked by the bursting of an imposthume near the\r\nheart. Which when the Podesta heard, perceiving that the girl's guilt could\r\nbut be slight, he sought to make a pretence of giving what it was not lawful\r\nfor him to sell her, and told her that he would set her at liberty, so she\r\nwere consenting to pleasure him; but finding that he did but waste his words\r\nhe cast aside all decency, and would have used force. Whereupon Andreuola,\r\nkindling with scorn, waxed exceeding brave, and defended herself with a\r\nvirile energy, and with high and contumelious words drove him from her.\r\n\r\nWhen 'twas broad day, the affair reached the ears of Messer Negro, who, half\r\ndead with grief, hied him with not a few of his friends to the palace;\r\nwhere, having heard all that the Podesta had to say, he required him\r\nperemptorily to give him back his daughter. The Podesta, being minded rather\r\nto be his own accuser, than that he should be accused by the girl of the\r\nviolence that he had meditated towards her, began by praising her and her\r\nconstancy, and in proof thereof went on to tell what he had done; he ended\r\nby saying, that, marking her admirable firmness, he had fallen mightily in\r\nlove with her, and so, notwithstanding she had been wedded to a man of low\r\ndegree, he would, if 'twere agreeable to her and to her father, Messer\r\nNegro, gladly make her his wife. While they thus spoke, Andreuola made her\r\nappearance, and, weeping, threw herself at her father's feet, saying:--\"My\r\nfather, I wot I need not tell you the story of my presumption, and the\r\ncalamity that has befallen me, for sure I am that you have heard it and know\r\nit; wherefore, with all possible humility I crave your pardon of my fault,\r\nto wit, that without your knowledge I took for my husband him that pleased\r\nme best. And this I crave, not that my life may be spared, but that I may\r\ndie as your daughter and not as your enemy;\" and so, weeping, she fell at\r\nhis feet. Messer Negro, now an old man, and naturally kindly and\r\naffectionate, heard her not without tears, and weeping raised her tenderly\r\nto her feet, saying:--\"Daughter mine, I had much liefer had it that thou\r\nhadst had a husband that I deemed a match for thee; and in that thou hadst\r\ntaken one that pleased thee I too had been pleased; but thy concealing thy\r\nchoice from me is grievous to me by reason of thy distrust of me, and yet\r\nmore so, seeing that thou hast lost him before I have known him. But as 'tis\r\neven so, to his remains be paid the honour which, while he lived for thy\r\ncontentment, I had gladly done him as my son-in-law.\" Then, turning to his\r\nsons and kinsmen, he bade them order Gabriotto's obsequies with all pomp and\r\nhonourable circumstance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the young man's kinsmen and kinswomen, having heard the news, had\r\nflocked thither, bringing with them almost all the rest of the folk, men and\r\nwomen alike, that were in the city. And so his body, resting on Andreuola's\r\ncloth, and covered with her roses, was laid out in the middle of the\r\ncourtyard, and there was mourned not by her and his kinsfolk alone, but\r\npublicly by well-nigh all the women of the city, and not a few men; and\r\nshouldered by some of the noblest of the citizens, as it had been the\r\nremains of no plebeian but of a noble, was borne from the public courtyard\r\nto the tomb with exceeding great pomp.\r\n\r\nSome days afterwards, as the Podesta continued to urge his suit, Messer\r\nNegro would have discussed the matter with his daughter; but, as she would\r\nhear none of it, and he was minded in this matter to defer to her wishes,\r\nshe and her maid entered a religious house of great repute for sanctity,\r\nwhere in just esteem they lived long time thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VII.\r\n\r\n--\r\nSimona loves Pasquino; they are together in a garden; Pasquino rubs a leaf\r\nof sage against his teeth, and dies; Simona is arrested, and, with intent to\r\nshew the judge how Pasquino died, rubs one of the leaves of the same plant\r\nagainst her teeth, and likewise dies.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen Pamfilo had done with his story, the king, betraying no compassion for\r\nAndreuola, glancing at Emilia, signified to her his desire that she should\r\nnow continue the sequence of narration. Emilia made no demur, and thus\r\nbegan:--\r\n\r\nDear gossips, Pamfilo's story puts me upon telling you another in no wise\r\nlike thereto, save in this, that as Andreuola lost her lover in a garden, so\r\nalso did she of whom I am to speak, and, being arrested like Andreuola, did\r\nalso deliver herself from the court, albeit 'twas not by any vigour or\r\nfirmness of mind, but by a sudden death. And, as 'twas said among us a while\r\nago, albeit Love affects the mansions of the noble, he does not, therefore,\r\ndisdain the dominion of the dwellings of the poor, nay, does there at times\r\ngive proof of his might no less signal than when he makes him feared of the\r\nwealthiest as a most potent lord. Which, though not fully, will in some\r\ndegree appear in my story, wherewith I am minded to return to our city, from\r\nwhich to-day's discourse, roving from matter to matter, and one part of the\r\nworld to another, has carried us so far.\r\n\r\nKnow then that no great while ago there dwelt in Florence a maid most fair,\r\nand, for her rank, debonair--she was but a poor man's daughter--whose name\r\nwas Simona; and though she must needs win with her own hands the bread she\r\nate, and maintain herself by spinning wool; yet was she not, therefore, of\r\nso poor a spirit, but that she dared to give harbourage in her mind to Love,\r\nwho for some time had sought to gain entrance there by means of the gracious\r\ndeeds and words of a young man of her own order that went about distributing\r\nwool to spin for his master, a wool-monger. Love being thus, with the\r\npleasant image of her beloved Pasquino, admitted into her soul, mightily did\r\nshe yearn, albeit she hazarded no advance, and heaved a thousand sighs\r\nfiercer than fire with every skein of yarn that she wound upon her spindle,\r\nwhile she called to mind who he was that had given her that wool to spin.\r\nPasquino on his part became, meanwhile, very anxious that his master's wool\r\nshould be well spun, and most particularly about that which Simona span, as\r\nif, indeed, it and it alone was to furnish forth the whole of the cloth. And\r\nso, what with the anxiety which the one evinced, and the gratification that\r\nit afforded to the other, it befell that, the one waxing unusually bold, and\r\nthe other casting off not a little of her wonted shyness and reserve, they\r\ncame to an understanding for their mutual solace; which proved so delightful\r\nto both, that neither waited to be bidden by the other, but 'twas rather\r\nwhich should be the first to make the overture.\r\n\r\nWhile thus they sped their days in an even tenor of delight, and ever grew\r\nmore ardently enamoured of one another, Pasquino chanced to say to Simona\r\nthat he wished of all things she would contrive how she might betake her to\r\na garden, whither he would bring her, that there they might be more at their\r\nease, and in greater security. Simona said that she was agreeable; and,\r\nhaving given her father to understand that she was minded to go to San Gallo\r\nfor the pardoning, she hied her with one of her gossips, Lagina by name, to\r\nthe garden of which Pasquino had told her. Here she found Pasquino awaiting\r\nher with a friend, one Puccino, otherwise Stramba; and Stramba and Lagina\r\nfalling at once to love-making, Pasquino and Simona left a part of the\r\ngarden to them, and withdrew to another part for their own solace.\r\n\r\nNow there was in their part of the garden a very fine and lovely sage-bush,\r\nat foot of which they sat them down and made merry together a great while,\r\nand talked much of a junketing they meant to have in the garden quite at\r\ntheir ease. By and by Pasquino, turning to the great sage-bush, plucked\r\ntherefrom a leaf, and fell to rubbing his teeth and gums therewith, saying\r\nthat sage was an excellent detergent of aught that remained upon them after\r\na meal. Having done so, he returned to the topic of the junketing of which\r\nhe had spoken before. But he had not pursued it far before his countenance\r\nentirely changed, and forthwith he lost sight and speech, and shortly after\r\ndied. Whereupon Simona fell a weeping and shrieking and calling Stramba and\r\nLagina; who, notwithstanding they came up with all speed, found Pasquino not\r\nonly dead but already swollen from head to foot, and covered with black\r\nspots both on the face and on the body; whereupon Stramba broke forth with:-\r\n-\"Ah! wicked woman! thou hast poisoned him;\" and made such a din that 'twas\r\nheard by not a few that dwelt hard by the garden; who also hasted to the\r\nspot, and seeing Pasquino dead and swollen, and hearing Stramba bewail\r\nhimself and accuse Simona of having maliciously poisoned him, while she, all\r\nbut beside herself for grief to be thus suddenly bereft of her lover, knew\r\nnot how to defend herself, did all with one accord surmise that 'twas even\r\nas Stramba said. Wherefore they laid hands on her, and brought her, still\r\nweeping bitterly, to the palace of the Podesta: where at the instant suit of\r\nStramba, backed by Atticciato and Malagevole, two other newly-arrived\r\nfriends of Pasquino, a judge forthwith addressed himself to question her of\r\nthe matter; and being unable to discover that she had used any wicked\r\npractice, or was guilty, he resolved to take her with him and go see the\r\ncorpse, and the place, and the manner of the death, as she had recounted it\r\nto him; for by her words he could not well understand it. So, taking care\r\nthat there should be no disturbance, he had her brought to the place where\r\nPasquino's corpse lay swollen like a tun, whither he himself presently came,\r\nand marvelling as he examined the corpse, asked her how the death had come\r\nabout. Whereupon, standing by the sagebush, she told him all that had\r\nhappened, and that he might perfectly apprehend the occasion of the death,\r\nshe did as Pasquino had done, plucked one of the leaves from the bush, and\r\nrubbed her teeth with it. Whereupon Stramba and Atticciato, and the rest of\r\nthe friends and comrades of Pasquino, making in the presence of the judge\r\nopen mock of what she did, as an idle and vain thing, and being more than\r\never instant to affirm her guilt, and to demand the fire as the sole condign\r\npenalty, the poor creature, that, between grief for her lost lover and dread\r\nof the doom demanded by Stramba, stood mute and helpless, was stricken no\r\nless suddenly, and in the same manner, and for the same cause (to wit, that\r\nshe had rubbed her teeth with the sage leaf) as Pasquino, to the no small\r\namazement of all that were present.\r\n\r\nOh! happy souls for whom one and the same day was the term of ardent love\r\nand earthly life! Happier still, if to the same bourn ye fared! Ay, and even\r\nyet more happy, if love there be in the other world, and there, even as\r\nhere, ye love! But happiest above all Simona, so far as we, whom she has\r\nleft behind, may judge, in that Fortune brooked not that the witness of\r\nStramba, Atticciato and Malagevole, carders, perchance, or yet viler\r\nfellows, should bear down her innocence, but found a more seemly issue, and,\r\nappointing her a like lot with her lover, gave her at once to clear herself\r\nfrom their foul accusation, and to follow whither the soul, that she so\r\nloved, of her Pasquino had preceded her!\r\n\r\nThe judge, and all else that witnessed the event, remained long time in a\r\nsort of stupefaction, knowing not what to say of it; but at length\r\nrecovering his wits, the judge said:--\"'Twould seem that this sage is\r\npoisonous, which the sage is not used to be. Let it be cut down to the roots\r\nand burned, lest another suffer by it in like sort.\" Which the gardener\r\nproceeding to do in the judge's presence, no sooner had he brought the great\r\nbush down, than the cause of the deaths of the two lovers plainly appeared:\r\nfor underneath it was a toad of prodigious dimensions, from whose venomous\r\nbreath, as they conjectured, the whole of the bush had contracted a\r\npoisonous quality. Around which toad, none venturing to approach it, they\r\nset a stout ring-fence of faggots, and burned it together with the sage. So\r\nended Master judge's inquest on the death of hapless Pasquino, who with his\r\nSimona, swollen as they were, were buried by Stramba, Atticciato, Guccio\r\nImbratta, and Malagevole in the church of San Paolo, of which, as it so\r\nhappened, they were parishioners.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VIII.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGirolamo loves Salvestra: yielding to his mother's prayers he goes to Paris;\r\nhe returns to find Salvestra married; he enters her house by stealth, lays\r\nhimself by her side, and dies; he is borne to the church, where Salvestra\r\nlays herself by his side, and dies.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen Emilia's story was done, Neifile at a word from the king thus\r\nbegan:--Some there are, noble ladies, who, methinks, deem themselves to be\r\nwiser than the rest of the world, and are in fact less so; and by\r\nconsequence presume to measure their wit against not only the counsels of\r\nmen but the nature of things; which presumption has from time to time been\r\nthe occasion of most grievous mishaps; but nought of good was ever seen to\r\nbetide thereof. And as there is nought in nature that brooks to be schooled\r\nor thwarted so ill as love, the quality of which is such that it is more\r\nlikely to die out of its own accord than to be done away of set purpose, I\r\nam minded to tell you a story of a lady, who, while she sought to be more\r\nwise than became her, and than she was, and indeed than the nature of the\r\nmatter, wherein she studied to shew her wisdom, allowed, thinking to unseat\r\nLove from the heart that he had occupied, and wherein perchance the stars\r\nhad established him, did in the end banish at one and the same time Love and\r\nlife from the frame of her son.\r\n\r\nKnow, then, that, as 'tis related by them of old time, there was once in our\r\ncity a very great and wealthy merchant, Leonardo Sighieri by name, who had\r\nby his lady a son named Girolamo, after whose birth he departed this life,\r\nleaving his affairs in meet and due order; and well and faithfully were they\r\nafterwards administered in the interest of the boy by his mother and\r\nguardians. As he grew up, consorting more frequently with the neighbours'\r\nchildren than any others of the quarter, he made friends with a girl of his\r\nown age that was the daughter of a tailor; and in course of time this\r\nfriendship ripened into a love so great and vehement, that Girolamo was ever\r\nill at ease when he saw her not; nor was her love for him a whit less strong\r\nthan his for her. Which his mother perceiving would not seldom chide him\r\ntherefor and chastise him. And as Girolamo could not give it up, she\r\nconfided her distress to his guardians, speaking--for by reason of her boy's\r\ngreat wealth she thought to make, as it were, an orange-tree out of a\r\nbramble--on this wise:--\"This boy of ours, who is now scarce fourteen years\r\nold, is so in love with a daughter of one of our neighbours, a tailor--\r\nSalvestra is the girl's name--that, if we part them not, he will,\r\nperadventure, none else witting, take her to wife some day, and I shall\r\nnever be happy again; or, if he see her married to another, he will pine\r\naway; to prevent which, methinks, you would do well to send him away to\r\ndistant parts on the affairs of the shop; for so, being out of sight she\r\nwill come at length to be out of mind, and then we can give him some\r\nwell-born girl to wife.\" Whereto the guardians answered, that 'twas well\r\nsaid, and that it should be so done to the best of their power: so they\r\ncalled the boy into the shop, and one of them began talking to him very\r\naffectionately on this wise:--\"My son, thou art now almost grown up; 'twere\r\nwell thou shouldst now begin to learn something for thyself of thy own\r\naffairs: wherefore we should be very well pleased if thou wert to go stay at\r\nParis a while, where thou wilt see how we trade with not a little of thy\r\nwealth, besides which thou wilt there become a much better, finer, and more\r\ncomplete gentleman than thou couldst here, and when thou hast seen the lords\r\nand barons and seigneurs that are there in plenty, and hast acquired their\r\nmanners, thou canst return hither.\" The boy listened attentively, and then\r\nanswered shortly that he would have none of it, for he supposed he might\r\nremain at Florence as well as another. Whereupon the worthy men plied him\r\nwith fresh argument, but were unable to elicit other answer from him, and\r\ntold his mother so. Whereat she was mightily incensed, and gave him a great\r\nscolding, not for his refusing to go to Paris, but for his love; which done,\r\nshe plied him with soft, wheedling words, and endearing expressions and\r\ngentle entreaties that he would be pleased to do as his guardians would have\r\nhim; whereby at length she prevailed so far, that he consented to go to\r\nParis for a year and no more; and so 'twas arranged. To Paris accordingly\r\nour ardent lover went, and there under one pretext or another was kept for\r\ntwo years. He returned more in love than ever, to find his Salvestra married\r\nto a good youth that was a tent-maker; whereat his mortification knew no\r\nbounds. But, seeing that what must be must be, he sought to compose his\r\nmind; and, having got to know where she lived, he took to crossing her path,\r\naccording to the wont of young men in love, thinking that she could no more\r\nhave forgotten him than he her. 'Twas otherwise, however; she remembered him\r\nno more than if she had never seen him; or, if she had any recollection of\r\nhim, she dissembled it: whereof the young man was very soon ware, to his\r\nextreme sorrow. Nevertheless he did all that he could to recall himself to\r\nher mind; but, as thereby he seemed to be nothing advantaged, he made up his\r\nmind, though he should die for it, to speak to her himself. So, being\r\ninstructed as to her house by a neighbour, he entered it privily one evening\r\nwhen she and her husband were gone to spend the earlier hours with some\r\nneighbours, and hid himself in her room behind some tent-cloths that were\r\nstretched there, and waited till they were come back, and gone to bed, and\r\nhe knew the husband to be asleep. Whereupon he got him to the place where he\r\nhad seen Salvestra lie down, and said as he gently laid his hand upon her\r\nbosom:--\"O my soul, art thou yet asleep?\" The girl was awake, and was on the\r\npoint of uttering a cry, when he forestalled her, saying:--\"Hush! for God's\r\nsake. I am thy Girolamo.\" Whereupon she, trembling in every limb:--\"Nay, but\r\nfor God's sake, Girolamo, begone: 'tis past, the time of our childhood, when\r\nour love was excusable. Thou seest I am married; wherefore 'tis no longer\r\nseemly that I should care for any other man than my husband, and so by the\r\none God, I pray thee, begone; for, if my husband were to know that thou art\r\nhere, the least evil that could ensue would be that I should never more be\r\nable to live with him in peace or comfort, whereas, having his love, I now\r\npass my days with him in tranquil happiness.\" Which speech caused the young\r\nman grievous distress; but 'twas in vain that he reminded her of the past,\r\nand of his love that distance had not impaired, and therewith mingled many a\r\nprayer and the mightiest protestations. Wherefore, yearning for death, he\r\nbesought her at last that she would suffer him to lie a while beside her\r\ntill he got some heat, for he was chilled through and through, waiting for\r\nher, and promised her that he would say never a word to her, nor touch her,\r\nand that as soon as he was a little warmed he would go away. On which terms\r\nSalvestra, being not without pity for him, granted his request. So the young\r\nman lay down beside her, and touched her not; but, gathering up into one\r\nthought the love he had so long borne her, the harshness with which she now\r\nrequited it, and his ruined hopes, resolved to live no longer, and in a\r\nconvulsion, without a word, and with fists clenched, expired by her side.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the girl, marvelling at his continence, and fearing lest her\r\nhusband should awake, broke silence, saying:--\"Nay, but, Girolamo, why goest\r\nthou not?\" But, receiving no answer, she supposed that he slept. Wherefore,\r\nreaching forth her hand to arouse him, she touched him and found him to her\r\ngreat surprise cold as ice; and touching him again and again somewhat\r\nrudely, and still finding that he did not stir, she knew that he was dead.\r\nHer grief was boundless, and 'twas long before she could bethink her how to\r\nact. But at last she resolved to sound her husband's mind as to what should\r\nbe done in such a case without disclosing that 'twas his own. So she\r\nawakened him, and told him how he was then bested, as if it were the affair\r\nof another, and then asked him, if such a thing happened to her, what course\r\nhe would take. The good man answered that he should deem it best to take the\r\ndead man privily home, and there leave him, bearing no grudge against the\r\nlady, who seemed to have done no wrong. \"And even so,\" said his wife, \"it is\r\nfor us to do;\" and taking his hand, she laid it on the corpse. Whereat he\r\nstarted up in consternation, and struck a light, and with out further parley\r\nwith his wife, clapped the dead man's clothes upon him, and forthwith\r\n(confident in his own innocence) raised him on his shoulders, and bore him\r\nto the door of his house, where he set him down and left him.\r\n\r\nDay came, and the dead man being found before his own door, there was a\r\ngreat stir made, particularly by his mother; the body was examined with all\r\ncare from head to foot, and, no wound or trace of violence being found on\r\nit, the physicians were on the whole of opinion that, as the fact was, the\r\nman had died of grief. So the corpse was borne to a church, and thither came\r\nthe sorrowing mother and other ladies, her kinswomen and neighbours, and\r\nbegan to wail and mourn over it without restraint after our Florentine\r\nfashion. And when the wailing had reached its height, the good man, in whose\r\nhouse the death had occurred, said to Salvestra:--\"Go wrap a mantle about\r\nthy head, and hie thee to the church, whither Girolamo has been taken, and\r\ngo about among the women and list what they say of this matter, and I will\r\ndo the like among the men, that we may hear if aught be said to our\r\ndisadvantage.\" The girl assented, for with tardy tenderness she now yearned\r\nto look on him dead, whom living she would not solace with a single kiss,\r\nand so to the church she went. Ah! how marvellous to whoso ponders it, is\r\nthe might of Love, and how unsearchable his ways! That heart, which, while\r\nFortune smiled on Girolamo, had remained sealed to him, opened to him now\r\nthat he was fordone, and, kindling anew with all its old flame, melted with\r\nsuch compassion that no sooner saw she his dead face, as there she stood\r\nwrapped in her mantle, than, edging her way forward through the crowd of\r\nwomen, she stayed not till she was beside the corpse; and there, uttering a\r\npiercing shriek, she threw herself upon the dead youth, and as her face met\r\nhis, and before she might drench it with her tears, grief that had reft life\r\nfrom him had even so reft it from her.\r\n\r\nThe women strove to comfort her, and bade her raise herself a little, for as\r\nyet they knew her not; then, as she did not arise, they would have helped\r\nher, but found her stiff and stark, and so, raising her up, they in one and\r\nthe same moment saw her to be Salvestra and dead. Whereat all the women that\r\nwere there, overborne by a redoubled pity, broke forth in wailing new and\r\nlouder far than before. From the church the bruit spread itself among the\r\nmen, and reached the ears of Salvestra's husband, who, deaf to all that\r\noffered comfort or consolation, wept a long while; after which he told to\r\nnot a few that were there what had passed in the night between the youth and\r\nhis wife; and so 'twas known of all how they came to die, to the common\r\nsorrow of all. So they took the dead girl, and arrayed her as they are wont\r\nto array the dead, and laid her on the same bed beside the youth, and long\r\ntime they mourned her: then were they both buried in the same tomb, and thus\r\nthose, whom love had not been able to wed in life, were wedded by death in\r\nindissoluble union.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL IX.\r\n\r\n--\r\nSieur Guillaume de Roussillon slays his wife's paramour, Sieur Guillaume de\r\nCabestaing, and gives her his heart to eat. She, coming to wit thereof,\r\nthrows herself from a high window to the ground, and dies, and is buried\r\nwith her lover.\r\n--\r\n\r\nNeifile's story, which had not failed to move her gossips to no little pity,\r\nbeing ended, none now remained to speak but the king and Dioneo, whose\r\nprivilege the king was minded not to infringe: wherefore he thus began:--I\r\npropose, compassionate my ladies, to tell you a story, which, seeing that\r\nyou so commiserate ill-starred loves, may claim no less a share of your pity\r\nthan the last, inasmuch as they were greater folk of whom I shall speak, and\r\nthat which befell them was more direful.\r\n\r\nYou are to know, then, that, as the Provencals relate, there were once in\r\nProvence two noble knights, each having castles and vassals under him, the\r\none yclept Sieur Guillaume de Roussillon, and the other Sieur Guillaume de\r\nCabestaing;(1) and being both most doughty warriors, they were as brothers,\r\nand went ever together, and bearing the same device, to tournament or joust,\r\nor other passage of arms. And, albeit each dwelt in his own castle, and the\r\ncastles were ten good miles apart, it nevertheless came to pass that, Sieur\r\nGuillaume de Roussillon having a most lovely lady, and amorous withal, to\r\nwife, Sieur Guillaume de Cabestaing, for all they were such friends and\r\ncomrades, became inordinately enamoured of the lady, who, by this, that, and\r\nthe other sign that he gave, discovered his passion, and knowing him for a\r\nmost complete knight, was flattered, and returned it, insomuch that she\r\nyearned and burned for him above all else in the world, and waited only till\r\nhe should make his suit to her, as before long he did; and so they met from\r\ntime to time, and great was their love. Which intercourse they ordered with\r\nso little discretion that 'twas discovered by the husband, who was very\r\nwroth, insomuch that the great love which he bore to Cabestaing was changed\r\ninto mortal enmity; and, dissembling it better than the lovers their love,\r\nhe made his mind up to kill Cabestaing. Now it came to pass that, while\r\nRoussillon was in this frame, a great tourney was proclaimed in France,\r\nwhereof Roussillon forthwith sent word to Cabestaing, and bade him to his\r\ncastle, so he were minded to come, that there they might discuss whether (or\r\nno) to go to the tourney, and how. Cabestaing was overjoyed, and made answer\r\nthat he would come to sup with him next day without fail. Which message\r\nbeing delivered, Roussillon wist that the time was come to slay Cabestaing.\r\nSo next day he armed himself, and, attended by a few servants, took horse,\r\nand about a mile from his castle lay in ambush in a wood through which\r\nCabestaing must needs pass. He waited some time, and then he saw Cabestaing\r\napproach unarmed with two servants behind, also unarmed, for he was without\r\nthought of peril on Roussillon's part. So Cabestaing came on to the place of\r\nRoussillon's choice, and then, fell and vengeful, Roussillon leapt forth\r\nlance in hand, and fell upon him, exclaiming:--\"Thou art a dead man!\" and\r\nthe words were no sooner spoken than the lance was through Cabestaing's\r\nbreast. Powerless either to defend himself or even utter a cry, Cabestaing\r\nfell to the ground, and soon expired. His servants waited not to see who had\r\ndone the deed, but turned their horses' heads and fled with all speed to\r\ntheir lord's castle. Roussillon dismounted, opened Cabestaing's breast with\r\na knife, and took out the heart with his own hands, wrapped it up in a\r\nbanderole, and gave it to one of his servants to carry: he then bade none\r\nmake bold to breathe a word of the affair, mounted his horse and rode\r\nback--'twas now night--to his castle. The lady, who had been told that\r\nCabestaing was to come to supper that evening, and was all impatience till\r\nhe should come, was greatly surprised to see her husband arrive without him.\r\nWherefore:--\"How is this, my lord?\" said she. \"Why tarries Cabestaing?\"\r\n\"Madam,\" answered her husband, \"I have tidings from him that he cannot be\r\nhere until to-morrow:\" whereat the lady was somewhat disconcerted.\r\n\r\nHaving dismounted, Roussillon called the cook, and said to him:--\"Here is a\r\nboar's heart; take it, and make thereof the daintiest and most delicious\r\ndish thou canst, and when I am set at table serve it in a silver porringer.\"\r\nSo the cook took the heart, and expended all his skill and pains upon it,\r\nmincing it and mixing with it plenty of good seasoning, and made thereof an\r\nexcellent ragout; and in due time Sieur Guillaume and his lady sat them down\r\nto table. The meat was served, but Sieur Guillaume, his mind engrossed with\r\nhis crime, ate but little. The cook set the ragout before him, but he,\r\nfeigning that he cared to eat no more that evening, had it passed on to the\r\nlady, and highly commended it. The lady, nothing loath, took some of it, and\r\nfound it so good that she ended by eating the whole. Whereupon:--\"Madam,\"\r\nquoth the knight, \"how liked you this dish?\" \"In good faith, my lord,\"\r\nreplied the lady, \"not a little.\" \"So help me, God,\" returned the knight, \"I\r\ndare be sworn you did; 'tis no wonder that you should enjoy that dead, which\r\nliving you enjoyed more than aught else in the world.\" For a while the lady\r\nwas silent; then:--\"How say you?\" said she; \"what is this you have caused me\r\nto eat?\" \"That which you have eaten,\" replied the knight, \"was in good sooth\r\nthe heart of Sieur Guillaume de Cabestaing, whom you, disloyal woman that\r\nyou are, did so much love: for assurance whereof I tell you that but a short\r\nwhile before I came back, I plucked it from his breast with my own hands.\"\r\nIt boots not to ask if the lady was sorrow-stricken to receive such tidings\r\nof her best beloved. But after a while she said:--\"'Twas the deed of a\r\ndisloyal and recreant knight; for if I, unconstrained by him, made him lord\r\nof my love, and thereby did you wrong, 'twas I, not he, should have borne\r\nthe penalty. But God forbid that fare of such high excellence as the heart\r\nof a knight so true and courteous as Sieur Guillaume de Cabestaing be\r\nfollowed by aught else.\" So saying she started to her feet, and stepping\r\nback to a window that was behind her, without a moment's hesitation let\r\nherself drop backwards therefrom. The window was at a great height from the\r\nground, so that the lady was not only killed by the fall, but almost reduced\r\nto atoms. Stunned and conscience-stricken by the spectacle, and fearing the\r\nvengeance of the country folk, and the Count of Provence, Sieur Guillaume\r\nhad his horses saddled and rode away. On the morrow the whole countryside\r\nknew how the affair had come about; wherefore folk from both of the castles\r\ntook the two bodies, and bore them with grief and lamentation exceeding\r\ngreat to the church in the lady's castle, and laid them in the same tomb,\r\nand caused verses to be inscribed thereon signifying who they were that were\r\nthere interred, and the manner and occasion of their death.\r\n\r\n(1) Boccaccio writes Guardastagno, but the troubadour, Cabestaing, or\r\nCabestany, is the hero of the story.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL X.\r\n\r\n--\r\nThe wife of a leech, deeming her lover, who has taken an opiate, to be dead,\r\nputs him in a chest, which, with him therein, two usurers carry off to their\r\nhouse. He comes to himself, and is taken for a thief; but, the lady's maid\r\ngiving the Signory to understand that she had put him in the chest which the\r\nusurers stole, he escapes the gallows, and the usurers are mulcted in moneys\r\nfor the theft of the chest.\r\n--\r\n\r\nNow that the king had told his tale, it only remained for Dioneo to do his\r\npart, which he witting, and being thereto bidden by the king, thus began:--\r\nSore have I--to say nought of you, my ladies--been of eyne and heart to hear\r\nthe woeful histories of ill-starred love, insomuch that I have desired of\r\nall things that they might have an end. Wherefore, now that, thank God,\r\nended they are, unless indeed I were minded, which God forbid, to add to\r\nsuch pernicious stuff a supplement of the like evil quality, no such\r\ndolorous theme do I purpose to ensue, but to make a fresh start with\r\nsomewhat of a better and more cheerful sort, which perchance may serve to\r\nsuggest to-morrow's argument.\r\n\r\nYou are to know, then, fairest my damsels, that 'tis not long since there\r\ndwelt at Salerno a leech most eminent in surgery, his name, Master Mazzeo\r\ndella Montagna, who in his extreme old age took to wife a fair damsel of the\r\nsame city, whom he kept in nobler and richer array of dresses and jewels,\r\nand all other finery that the sex affects, than any other lady in Salerno.\r\nHowbeit, she was none too warm most of her time, being ill covered abed by\r\nthe doctor; who gave her to understand--even as Messer Ricciardo di\r\nChinzica, of whom we spoke a while since, taught his lady the feasts--that\r\nfor once that a man lay with a woman he needed I know not how many days to\r\nrecover, and the like nonsense: whereby she lived as ill content as might\r\nbe; and, lacking neither sense nor spirit, she determined to economize at\r\nhome, and taking to the street, to live at others' expense. So, having\r\npassed in review divers young men, she at last found one that was to her\r\nmind, on whom she set all her heart and hopes of happiness. Which the\r\ngallant perceiving was mightily flattered, and in like manner gave her all\r\nhis love. Ruggieri da Jeroli--such was the gallant's name--was of noble\r\nbirth, but of life, and conversation so evil and reprehensible that kinsman\r\nor friend he had none left that wished him well, or cared to see him; and\r\nall Salerno knew him for a common thief and rogue of the vilest character.\r\nWhereof the lady took little heed, having a mind to him for another reason;\r\nand so with the help of her maid she arranged a meeting with him. But after\r\nthey had solaced themselves a while, the lady began to censure his past\r\nlife, and to implore him for love of her to depart from such evil ways; and\r\nto afford him the means thereto, she from time to time furnished him with\r\nmoney. While thus with all discretion they continued their intercourse, it\r\nchanced that a man halt of one of his legs was placed under the leech's\r\ncare. The leech saw what was amiss with him, and told his kinsfolk, that,\r\nunless a gangrened bone that he had in his leg were taken out, he must die,\r\nor have the whole leg amputated; that if the bone were removed he might\r\nrecover; but that otherwise he would not answer for his life: whereupon the\r\nrelatives assented that the bone should be removed, and left the patient in\r\nthe hands of the leech; who, deeming that by reason of the pain 'twas not\r\npossible for him to endure the treatment without an opiate, caused to be\r\ndistilled in the morning a certain water of his own concoction, whereby the\r\npatient, drinking it, might be ensured sleep during such time as he deemed\r\nthe operation, which he meant to perform about vespers, would occupy. In the\r\nmeantime he had the water brought into his house, and set it in the window\r\nof his room, telling no one what it was. But when the vesper hour was come,\r\nand the leech was about to visit his patient, a messenger arrived from some\r\nvery great friends of his at Amalfi, bearing tidings of a great riot there\r\nhad been there, in which not a few had been wounded, and bidding him on no\r\naccount omit to hie him thither forthwith. Wherefore the leech put off the\r\ntreatment of the leg to the morrow, and took boat to Amalfi; and the lady,\r\nknowing that he would not return home that night, did as she was wont in\r\nsuch a case, to wit, brought Ruggieri in privily, and locked him in her\r\nchamber until certain other folk that were in the house were gone to sleep.\r\nRuggieri, then, being thus in the chamber, awaiting the lady, and having--\r\nwhether it were that he had had a fatiguing day, or eaten something salt,\r\nor, perchance, that 'twas his habit of body--a mighty thirst, glancing at\r\nthe window, caught sight of the bottle containing the water which the leech\r\nhad prepared for the patient, and taking it to be drinking water, set it to\r\nhis lips and drank it all, and in no long time fell into a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nSo soon as she was able the lady hied her to the room, and there finding\r\nRuggieri asleep, touched him and softly told him to get up: to no purpose,\r\nhowever; he neither answered nor stirred a limb. Wherefore the lady, rather\r\nlosing patience, applied somewhat more force, and gave him a push, saying:--\r\n\"Get up, sleepy-head; if thou hadst a mind to sleep, thou shouldst have gone\r\nhome, and not have come hither.\" Thus pushed Ruggieri fell down from a box\r\non which he lay, and, falling, shewed no more sign of animation than if he\r\nhad been a corpse. The lady, now somewhat alarmed, essayed to lift him, and\r\nshook him roughly, and took him by the nose, and pulled him by the beard;\r\nagain to no purpose: he had tethered his ass to a stout pin. So the lady\r\nbegan to fear he must be dead: however, she went on to pinch him shrewdly,\r\nand singe him with the flame of a candle; but when these methods also failed\r\nshe, being, for all she was a leech's wife, no leech herself, believed for\r\nsure that he was dead; and as there was nought in the world that she loved\r\nso much, it boots not to ask if she was sore distressed; wherefore silently,\r\nfor she dared not lament aloud, she began to weep over him and bewail such a\r\nmisadventure. But, after a while, fearing lest her loss should not be\r\nwithout a sequel of shame, she bethought her that she must contrive without\r\ndelay to get the body out of the house; and standing in need of another's\r\nadvice, she quietly summoned her maid, shewed her the mishap that had\r\nbefallen her, and craved her counsel. Whereat the maid marvelled not a\r\nlittle; and she too fell to pulling Ruggieri this way and that, and pinching\r\nhim, and, as she found no sign of life in him, concurred with her mistress\r\nthat he was verily dead, and advised her to remove him from the house. \"And\r\nwhere,\" said the lady, \"shall we put him, that to-morrow, when he is\r\ndiscovered, it be not suspected that 'twas hence he was carried?\" \"Madam,\"\r\nanswered the maid, \"late last evening I marked in front of our neighbour the\r\ncarpenter's shop a chest, not too large, which, if he have not put it back\r\nin the house, will come in very handy for our purpose, for we will put him\r\ninside, and give him two or three cuts with a knife, and so leave him. When\r\nhe is found, I know not why it should be thought that 'twas from this house\r\nrather than from any other that he was put there; nay, as he was an evil-\r\nliver, 'twill more likely be supposed, that, as he hied him on some evil\r\nerrand, some enemy slew him, and then put him in the chest.\" The lady said\r\nthere was nought in the world she might so ill brook as that Ruggieri should\r\nreceive any wound; but with that exception she approved her maid's proposal,\r\nand sent her to see if the chest were still where she had seen it. The maid,\r\nreturning, reported that there it was, and, being young and strong, got\r\nRuggieri, with the lady's help, upon her shoulders; and so the lady, going\r\nbefore to espy if any folk came that way, and the maid following, they came\r\nto the chest, and having laid Ruggieri therein, closed it and left him\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nNow a few days before, two young men, that were usurers, had taken up their\r\nquarters in a house a little further on: they had seen the chest during the\r\nday, and being short of furniture, and having a mind to make great gain with\r\nlittle expenditure, they had resolved that, if it were still there at night,\r\nthey would take it home with them. So at midnight forth they hied them, and\r\nfinding the chest, were at no pains to examine it closely, but forthwith,\r\nthough it seemed somewhat heavy, bore it off to their house, and set it down\r\nbeside a room in which their women slept; and without being at pains to\r\nadjust it too securely they left it there for the time, and went to bed.\r\n\r\nTowards matins Ruggieri, having had a long sleep and digested the draught\r\nand exhausted its efficacy, awoke, but albeit his slumber was broken, and\r\nhis senses had recovered their powers, yet his brain remained in a sort of\r\ntorpor which kept him bemused for some days; and when he opened his eyes and\r\nsaw nothing, and stretched his hands hither and thither and found himself in\r\nthe chest, it was with difficulty that he collected his thoughts. \"How is\r\nthis?\" he said to himself. \"Where am I? Do I sleep or wake? I remember\r\ncoming this evening to my lady's chamber; and now it seems I am in a chest.\r\nWhat means it? Can the leech have returned, or somewhat else have happened\r\nthat caused the lady, while I slept, to hide me here? That was it, I\r\nsuppose. Without a doubt it must have been so.\" And having come to this\r\nconclusion, he composed himself to listen, if haply he might hear something,\r\nand being somewhat ill at ease in the chest, which was none too large, and\r\nthe side on which he lay paining him, he must needs turn over to the other,\r\nand did so with such adroitness that, bringing his loins smartly against one\r\nof the sides of the chest, which was set on an uneven floor, he caused it to\r\ntilt and then fall; and such was the noise that it made as it fell that the\r\nwomen that slept there awoke, albeit for fear they kept silence. Ruggieri\r\nwas not a little disconcerted by the fall, but, finding that thereby the\r\nchest was come open, he judged that, happen what might, he would be better\r\nout of it than in it; and not knowing where he was, and being otherwise at\r\nhis wits' end, he began to grope about the house, if haply he might find a\r\nstair or door whereby he might take himself off. Hearing him thus groping\r\nhis way, the alarmed women gave tongue with:--\"Who is there?\" Ruggieri, not\r\nknowing the voice, made no answer: wherefore the women fell to calling the\r\ntwo young men, who, having had a long day, were fast asleep, and heard\r\nnought of what went on. Which served to increase the fright of the women,\r\nwho rose and got them to divers windows, and raised the cry:--\"Take thief,\r\ntake thief!\" At which summons there came running from divers quarters not a\r\nfew of the neighbours, who got into the house by the roof or otherwise as\r\neach best might: likewise the young men, aroused by the din, got up; and,\r\nRuggieri being now all but beside himself for sheer amazement, and knowing\r\nnot whither to turn him to escape them, they took him and delivered him to\r\nthe officers of the Governor of the city, who, hearing the uproar, had\r\nhasted to the spot. And so he was brought before the Governor, who, knowing\r\nhim to be held of all a most arrant evil-doer, put him forthwith to the\r\ntorture, and, upon his confessing that he had entered the house of the\r\nusurers with intent to rob, was minded to make short work of it, and have\r\nhim hanged by the neck.\r\n\r\nIn the morning 'twas bruited throughout all Salerno that Ruggieri had been\r\ntaken a thieving in the house of the usurers. Whereat the lady and her maid\r\nwere all amazement and bewilderment, insomuch that they were within an ace\r\nof persuading themselves that what they had done the night before they had\r\nnot done, but had only dreamed it; besides which, the peril in which\r\nRuggieri stood caused the lady such anxiety as brought her to the verge of\r\nmadness. Shortly after half tierce the leech, being returned from Amalfi,\r\nand minded now to treat his patient, called for his water, and finding the\r\nbottle empty made a great commotion, protesting that nought in his house\r\ncould be let alone. The lady, having other cause of annoy, lost temper, and\r\nsaid:--\"What would you say, Master, of an important matter, when you raise\r\nsuch a din because a bottle of water has been upset? Is there never another\r\nto be found in the world?\" \"Madam,\" replied the leech, \"thou takest this to\r\nhave been mere water. 'Twas no such thing, but an artificial water of a\r\nsoporiferous virtue;\" and he told her for what purpose he had made it. Which\r\nthe lady no sooner heard, than, guessing that Ruggieri had drunk it, and so\r\nhad seemed to them to be dead, she said:--\"Master, we knew it not; wherefore\r\nmake you another.\" And so the leech, seeing that there was no help for it,\r\nhad another made. Not long after, the maid, who by the lady's command had\r\ngone to find out what folk said of Ruggieri, returned, saying:--\"Madam, of\r\nRuggieri they say nought but evil, nor, by what I have been able to\r\ndiscover, has he friend or kinsman that has or will come to his aid; and\r\n'tis held for certain that to-morrow the Stadic(1) will have him hanged.\r\nBesides which, I have that to tell you which will surprise you; for,\r\nmethinks, I have found out how he came into the usurers' house. List, then,\r\nhow it was: you know the carpenter in front of whose shop stood the chest we\r\nput Ruggieri into: he had to-day the most violent altercation in the world\r\nwith one to whom it would seem the chest belongs, by whom he was required to\r\nmake good the value of the chest, to which he made answer that he had not\r\nsold it, but that it had been stolen from him in the night. 'Not so,' said\r\nthe other; 'thou soldst it to the two young usurers, as they themselves told\r\nme last night, when I saw it in their house at the time Ruggieri was taken.'\r\n'They lie,' replied the carpenter. 'I never sold it them, but they must have\r\nstolen it from me last night; go we to them.' So with one accord off they\r\nwent to the usurers' house, and I came back here. And so, you see, I make\r\nout that 'twas on such wise that Ruggieri was brought where he was found;\r\nbut how he came to life again, I am at a loss to conjecture.\" The lady now\r\nunderstood exactly how things were, and accordingly told the maid what she\r\nhad learned from the leech, and besought her to aid her to get Ruggieri off,\r\nfor so she might, if she would, and at the same time preserve her honour.\r\n\"Madam,\" said the maid, \"do but shew me how; and glad shall I be to do just\r\nas you wish.\" Whereupon the lady, to whom necessity taught invention, formed\r\nher plan on the spur of the moment, and expounded it in detail to the maid;\r\nwho (as the first step) hied her to the leech, and, weeping, thus addressed\r\nhim:--\"Sir, it behoves me to ask your pardon of a great wrong that I have\r\ndone you.\" \"And what may that be?\" inquired the leech. \"Sir,\" said the maid,\r\nwho ceased not to weep, \"you know what manner of man is Ruggieri da Jeroli.\r\nNow he took a fancy to me, and partly for fear, partly for love, I this year\r\nagreed to be his mistress; and knowing yestereve that you were from home, he\r\ncoaxed me into bringing him into your house to sleep with me in my room. Now\r\nhe was athirst, and I, having no mind to be seen by your lady, who was in\r\nthe hall, and knowing not whither I might sooner betake me for wine or\r\nwater, bethought me that I had seen a bottle of water in your room, and ran\r\nand fetched it, and gave it him to drink, and then put the bottle back in\r\nthe place whence I had taken it; touching which I find that you have made a\r\ngreat stir in the house. Verily I confess that I did wrong; but who is there\r\nthat does not wrong sometimes? Sorry indeed am I to have so done, but 'tis\r\nnot for such a cause and that which ensued thereon that Ruggieri should lose\r\nhis life. Wherefore, I do most earnestly beseech you, pardon me, and suffer\r\nme to go help him as best I may be able.\" Wroth though he was at what he\r\nheard, the leech replied in a bantering tone:--\"Thy pardon thou hast by\r\nthine own deed; for, whereas thou didst last night think to have with thee a\r\ngallant that would thoroughly dust thy pelisse for thee, he was but a sleepy\r\nhead; wherefore get thee gone, and do what thou mayst for the deliverance of\r\nthy lover, and for the future look thou bring him not into the house; else I\r\nwill pay thee for that turn and this to boot.\" The maid, deeming that she\r\nhad come off well in the first brush, hied her with all speed to the prison\r\nwhere Ruggieri lay, and by her cajoleries prevailed upon the warders to let\r\nher speak with him; and having told him how he must answer the Stadic if he\r\nwould get off, she succeeded in obtaining preaudience of the Stadic; who,\r\nseeing that the baggage was lusty and mettlesome, was minded before he heard\r\nher to grapple her with the hook, to which she was by no means averse,\r\nknowing that such a preliminary would secure her a better hearing. When she\r\nhad undergone the operation and was risen:--\"Sir,\" said she, \"you have here\r\nRuggieri da Jeroli, apprehended on a charge of theft; which charge is\r\nfalse.\" Whereupon she told him the whole story from beginning to end, how\r\nshe, being Ruggieri's mistress, had brought him into the leech's house and\r\nhad given him the opiate, not knowing it for such, and taking him to be\r\ndead, had put him in the chest; and then recounting what she had heard pass\r\nbetween the carpenter and the owner of the chest, she shewed him how\r\nRuggieri came into the house of the usurers. Seeing that 'twas easy enough\r\nto find out whether the story were true, the Stadic began by questioning the\r\nleech as to the water, and found that 'twas as she had said: he then\r\nsummoned the carpenter, the owner of the chest and the usurers, and after\r\nmuch further parley ascertained that the usurers had stolen the chest during\r\nthe night, and brought it into their house: finally he sent for Ruggieri,\r\nand asked him where he had lodged that night, to which Ruggieri answered\r\nthat where he had lodged he knew not, but he well remembered going to pass\r\nthe night with Master Mazzeo's maid, in whose room he had drunk some water\r\nby reason of a great thirst that he had; but what happened to him\r\nafterwards, except that, when he awoke, he found himself in a chest in the\r\nhouse of the usurers, he knew not. All which matters the Stadic heard with\r\ngreat interest, and caused the maid and Ruggieri and the carpenter and the\r\nusurers to rehearse them several times. In the end, seeing that Ruggieri was\r\ninnocent, he released him, and mulcted the usurers in fifteen ounces for the\r\ntheft of the chest. How glad Ruggieri was thus to escape, it boots not to\r\nask; and glad beyond measure was his lady. And so, many a time did they\r\nlaugh and make merry together over the affair, she and he and the dear maid\r\nthat had proposed to give him a taste of the knife; and remaining constant\r\nin their love, they had ever better and better solace thereof. The like\r\nwhereof befall me, sans the being put in the chest.\r\n\r\n(1) The Neapolitan term for the chief of police.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeartsore as the gentle ladies had been made by the preceding stories, this\r\nlast of Dioneo provoked them to such merriment, more especially the passage\r\nabout the Stadic and the hook, that they lacked not relief of the piteous\r\nmood engendered by the others. But the king observing that the sun was now\r\ntaking a yellowish tinge, and that the end of his sovereignty was come, in\r\nterms most courtly made his excuse to the fair ladies, that he had made so\r\ndireful a theme as lovers' infelicity the topic of their discourse; after\r\nwhich, he rose, took the laurel wreath from his head, and, while the ladies\r\nwatched to see to whom he would give it, set it graciously upon the blond\r\nhead of Fiammetta, saying:--\"Herewith I crown thee, as deeming that thou,\r\nbetter than any other, wilt know how to make to-morrow console our fair\r\ncompanions for the rude trials of to-day.\" Fiammetta, whose wavy tresses\r\nfell in a flood of gold over her white and delicate shoulders, whose softly\r\nrounded face was all radiant with the very tints of the white lily blended\r\nwith the red of the rose, who carried two eyes in her head that matched\r\nthose of a peregrine falcon, while her tiny sweet mouth shewed a pair of\r\nlips that shone as rubies, replied with a smile:--\"And gladly take I the\r\nwreath, Filostrato, and that thou mayst more truly understand what thou hast\r\ndone, 'tis my present will and pleasure that each make ready to discourse\r\nto-morrow of good fortune befalling lovers after divers direful or\r\ndisastrous adventures.\" The theme propounded was approved by all; whereupon\r\nthe queen called the seneschal, and having made with him all meet\r\narrangements, rose and gaily dismissed all the company until the supper\r\nhour; wherefore, some straying about the garden, the beauties of which were\r\nnot such as soon to pall, others bending their steps towards the mills that\r\nwere grinding without, each, as and where it seemed best, they took\r\nmeanwhile their several pleasures. The supper hour come, they all gathered,\r\nin their wonted order, by the fair fountain, and in the gayest of spirits\r\nand well served they supped. Then rising they addressed them, as was their\r\nwont, to dance and song, and while Filomena led the dance:--\"Filostrato,\"\r\nsaid the queen, \"being minded to follow in the footsteps of our\r\npredecessors, and that, as by their, so by our command a song be sung; and\r\nwell witting that thy songs are even as thy stories, to the end that no day\r\nbut this be vexed with thy misfortunes, we ordain that thou give us one of\r\nthem, whichever thou mayst prefer.\" Filostrato answered that he would gladly\r\ndo so; and without delay began to sing on this wise:--\r\n\r\nFull well my tears attest,\r\nO traitor Love, with what just cause the heart,\r\nWith which thou once hast broken faith, doth smart.\r\n\r\nLove, when thou first didst in my heart enshrine\r\nHer for whom still I sigh, alas! in vain,\r\nNor any hope do know,\r\nA damsel so complete thou didst me shew,\r\nThat light as air I counted every pain,\r\nWherewith behest of thine\r\nCondemned my soul to pine.\r\nAh! but I gravely erred; the which to know\r\nToo late, alas! doth but enhance my woe.\r\n\r\nThe cheat I knew not ere she did me leave,\r\nShe, she, in whom alone my hopes were placed:\r\nFor 'twas when I did most\r\nFlatter myself with hope, and proudly boast\r\nMyself her vassal lowliest and most graced,\r\nNor thought Love might bereave,\r\nNor dreamed he e'er might grieve,\r\n'Twas then I found that she another's worth\r\nInto her heart had ta'en and me cast forth.\r\n\r\nA plant of pain, alas! my heart did bear,\r\nWhat time my hapless self cast forth I knew;\r\nAnd there it doth remain;\r\nAnd day and hour I curse and curse again,\r\nWhen first that front of love shone on my view\r\nThat front so queenly fair,\r\nAnd bright beyond compare!\r\nWherefore at once my faith, my hope, my fire\r\nMy soul doth imprecate, ere she expire.\r\n\r\nMy lord, thou knowest how comfortless my woe,\r\nThou, Love, my lord, whom thus I supplicate\r\nWith many a piteous moan,\r\nTelling thee how in anguish sore I groan,\r\nYearning for death my pain to mitigate.\r\nCome death, and with one blow\r\nCut short my span, and so\r\nWith my curst life me of my frenzy ease;\r\nFor wheresoe'er I go, 'twill sure decrease.\r\n\r\nSave death no way of comfort doth remain:\r\nNo anodyne beside for this sore smart.\r\nThe boon, then, Love bestow;\r\nAnd presently by death annul my woe,\r\nAnd from this abject life release my heart.\r\nSince from me joy is ta'en,\r\nAnd every solace, deign\r\nMy prayer to grant, and let my death the cheer\r\nComplete, that she now hath of her new fere.\r\n\r\nSong, it may be that no one shall thee learn:\r\nNor do I care; for none I wot, so well\r\nAs I may chant thee; so,\r\nThis one behest I lay upon thee, go\r\nHie thee to Love, and him in secret tell,\r\nHow I my life do spurn,\r\nMy bitter life, and yearn,\r\nThat to a better harbourage he bring\r\nMe, of all might and grace that own him king.\r\n\r\nFull well my tears attest, etc.\r\n\r\nFilostrato's mood and its cause were made abundantly manifest by the words\r\nof this song; and perchance they had been made still more so by the looks of\r\na lady that was among the dancers, had not the shades of night, which had\r\nnow overtaken them, concealed the blush that suffused her face. Other songs\r\nfollowed until the hour for slumber arrived: whereupon at the behest of the\r\nqueen all the ladies sought their several chambers.\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

his hair.\n\n     All softly playing,\n     With head to the music bent,\n     And fingers straying\n     Upon an instrument.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n     The twilight turns from amethyst\n     To deep and

Her head inclines this way.\n\n     Shy thought and grave wide eyes and hands\n     That wander as they list--\n     The twilight turns to darker blue\n     With lights of amethyst.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n     At that hour when all things have repose,\n     O lonely watcher of the skies,\n     Do you hear the night wind and the sighs\n     Of harps playing unto Love to unclose\n     The pale gates of

Mine, O Mine!\n     No more be tears in moon or mist\n     For thee, sweet sentimentalist.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n     Go seek her out all courteously,\n     And say I come,\n     Wind of spices whose song is ever\n     Epithalamium.\n     O, hurry over the dark lands\n     And run upon the sea\n     For seas and lands shall not divide us\n     My love and me.\n\n     Now, wind, of your good courtesy\n     I pray you go,\n     And come into her little garden\n     And sing at her window;\n     Singing: The bridal wind is blowing\n     For Love is at his noon;\n     And soon will your true love be

music of sighs:\n     Arise, arise,\n     My dove, my beautiful one!\n\n     I wait by the cedar tree,\n     My sister, my love,\n     White breast of the dove,\n     My breast shall be your bed.\n\n     The pale dew lies\n     Like a veil on my head.\n     My fair one, my fair dove,\n     Arise, arise!\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n     From dewy dreams, my soul, arise,\n     From love's deep slumber and from death,\n     For lo! the trees are full of sighs\n     Whose leaves the morn admonisheth.\n\n     Eastward the gradual dawn prevails\n     Where softly-burning fires appear,\n     Making to tremble all those veils\n     Of grey and golden gossamer.\n\n     While sweetly, gently, secretly,\n     The flowery bells of morn are stirred\n     And the wise choirs of faery\n     Begin (innumerous!) to be heard.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n     O cool is the valley now\n     And there, love, will we go\n     For many a choir is singing now\n     Where Love did sometime go.\n     And hear you not the thrushes calling,\n     Calling us away?\n     O cool and pleasant is the valley\n     And there, love, will we stay.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n     Because your voice was at my side\n     I gave him pain,\n     Because within my hand I held\n     Your hand again.\n\n     There is no word nor any sign\n     Can make amend--\n     He is a stranger to me now\n     Who was my friend.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n     O Sweetheart, hear you\n     Your lover's tale;\n     A man shall have sorrow\n     When friends him fail.\n\n     For he shall know then\n     Friends be untrue\n     And a little ashes\n     Their words come to.\n\n     But one unto him\n     Will softly move\n     And softly woo him\n     In ways of love.\n\n     His hand is under\n     Her smooth round breast;\n     So he who has sorrow\n     Shall have rest.\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n     Be not sad because all men\n     Prefer a lying clamour before you:\n     Sweetheart, be at peace again--\n     Can they dishonour you?\n\n     They are sadder than all tears;\n     Their lives ascend as a continual sigh.\n     Proudly answer to their tears:\n     As they deny, deny.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n     In the dark pine-wood\n     I would we lay,\n     In deep cool shadow\n     At noon of day.\n\n     How sweet to lie there,\n     Sweet to kiss,\n     Where the great pine-forest\n     Enaisled is!\n\n     Thy kiss descending\n     Sweeter were\n     With a soft tumult\n     Of thy hair.\n\n     O unto the pine-wood\n     At noon of day\n     Come with me now,\n     Sweet love, away.\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n     He who hath glory lost, nor hath\n     Found any soul to fellow his,\n     Among his foes in scorn and wrath\n     Holding to ancient nobleness,\n     That high unconsortable one--\n     His love is his companion.\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n     Of that so sweet imprisonment\n     My soul, dearest, is fain--\n     Soft arms that woo me to relent\n     And woo me to detain.\n     Ah, could they ever hold me there\n     Gladly were I a prisoner!\n\n     Dearest, through interwoven arms\n     By love made tremulous,\n     That night allures me where alarms\n     Nowise may trouble us;\n     But sleep to dreamier sleep be wed\n     Where soul with soul lies prisoned.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\n     This heart that flutters near my heart\n     My hope and all my riches is,\n     Unhappy when we draw apart\n     And happy between kiss and kiss:\n     My hope and all my riches--yes!--\n     And all my happiness.\n\n     For there, as in some mossy nest\n     The wrens will divers treasures keep,\n     I laid those treasures I possessed\n     Ere that mine eyes had learned to weep.\n     Shall we not be as wise as they\n     Though love live but a day?\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\n     Silently she's combing,\n     Combing her long hair\n     Silently and graciously,\n     With many a pretty air.\n\n     The sun is in the willow leaves\n     And on the dapplled grass,\n     And still she's combing her long hair\n     Before the looking-glass.\n\n     I pray you, cease to comb out,\n     Comb out your long hair,\n     For I have heard of witchery\n     Under a pretty air,\n\n     That makes as one thing to the lover\n     Staying and going hence,\n     All fair, with many a pretty air\n     And many a negligence.\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\n     Lightly come or lightly go:\n     Though thy heart presage thee woe,\n     Vales and many a wasted sun,\n     Oread let thy laughter run,\n     Till the irreverent mountain air\n     Ripple all thy flying hair.\n\n     Lightly, lightly--ever so:\n     Clouds that wrap the vales below\n     At the hour of evenstar\n     Lowliest attendants are;\n     Love and laughter song-confessed\n     When the heart is heaviest.\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\n     Thou leanest to the shell of night,\n     Dear lady, a divining ear.\n     In that soft choiring of delight\n     What sound hath made thy heart to fear?\n     Seemed it of rivers rushing forth\n     From the grey deserts of the north?\n\n     That mood of thine\n     Is his, if thou but scan it well,\n     Who a mad tale bequeaths to us\n     At ghosting hour conjurable--\n     And all for some strange name he read\n                In Purchas or in Holinshed.\n\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\n     Though I thy Mithridates were,\n     Framed to defy the poison-dart,\n     Yet must thou fold me unaware\n     To know the rapture of thy heart,\n     And I but render and confess\n     The malice of thy tenderness.\n\n     For elegant and antique phrase,\n     Dearest, my lips wax all too wise;\n     Nor have I known a love whose praise\n     Our piping poets solemnize,\n     Neither a love where may not be\n     Ever so little falsity.\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\n     Gentle lady, do not sing\n     Sad songs about the end of love;\n     Lay aside sadness and sing\n     How love that passes is enough.\n\n     Sing about the long deep sleep\n     Of lovers that are dead, and how\n     In the grave all love shall sleep:\n     Love is aweary now.\n\n\n\n\nXXIX\n\n     Dear heart, why will you use me so?\n     Dear eyes that gently me upbraid,\n     Still are you beautiful--but O,\n     How is your beauty raimented!\n\n     Through the clear mirror of your eyes,\n     Through the soft sigh of kiss to kiss,\n     Desolate winds assail with cries\n     The shadowy garden where love is.\n\n     And soon shall love dissolved be\n     When over us the wild winds blow--\n     But you, dear love, too dear to me,\n     Alas! why will you use me so?\n\n\n\n\nXXX\n\n     Love came to us in time gone by\n     When one at twilight shyly played\n     And one in fear was standing nigh--\n     For Love at first is all afraid.\n\n     We were grave lovers. Love is past\n     That had his sweet hours many a one;\n     Welcome to us now at the last\n     The ways that we shall go upon.\n\n\n\n\nXXXI\n\n     O, it was out by Donnycarney\n     When the bat flew from tree to tree\n     My love and I did walk together;\n     And sweet were the words she said to me.\n\n     Along with us the summer wind\n     Went murmuring--O, happily!--\n     But softer than the breath of summer\n     Was the kiss she gave to me.\n\n\n\n\nXXXII\n\n     Rain has fallen all the day.\n     O come among the laden trees:\n     The leaves lie thick upon the way\n     Of memories.\n\n     Staying a little by the way\n     Of memories shall we depart.\n     Come, my beloved, where I may\n     Speak to your heart.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII\n\n     Now, O now, in this brown land\n     Where Love did so sweet music make\n     We two shall wander, hand in hand,\n     Forbearing for old friendship' sake,\n     Nor grieve because our love was gay\n     Which now is ended in this way.\n\n     A rogue in red and yellow dress\n     Is knocking, knocking at the tree;\n     And all around our loneliness\n     The wind is whistling merrily.\n     The leaves--they do not sigh at all\n     When the year takes them in the fall.\n\n     Now, O now, we hear no more\n     The vilanelle and roundelay!\n     Yet will we kiss, sweetheart, before\n     We take sad leave at close of day.\n     Grieve not, sweetheart, for anything--\n     The year, the year is gathering.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIV\n\n     Sleep now, O sleep now,\n     O you unquiet heart!\n     A voice crying \"Sleep now\"\n     Is heard in my heart.\n\n     The voice of the winter\n     Is heard at the door.\n     O sleep, for the winter\n     Is crying \"Sleep no more.\"\n\n     My kiss will give peace now\n     And quiet to your heart--\n     Sleep on in peace now,\n     O you unquiet heart!\n\n\n\n\nXXXV\n\n     All day I hear the noise of waters\n     Making moan,\n     Sad as the sea-bird is when, going\n     Forth alone,\n     He hears the winds cry to the water's\n     Monotone.\n     The grey winds, the cold winds are blowing\n     Where I go.\n     I hear the noise of many waters\n     Far below.\n     All day, all night, I hear them flowing\n     To and fro.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVI\n\n     I hear an army charging upon the land,\n     And the thunder of horses plunging, foam about their knees:\n     Arrogant, in black armour, behind them stand,\n     Disdaining the reins, with fluttering ships, the charioteers.\n     They cry unto the night their battle-name:\n     I moan in sleep when I hear afar their whirling laughter.\n     They cleave the gloom of dreams, a blinding flame,\n     Clanging, clanging upon the heart as upon an anvil.\n     They come shaking in triumph their long, green hair:\n     They come out of the sea and run shouting by the shore.\n     My heart, have you no wisdom thus to despair?\n     My love, my love, my love, why have you left me alone?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- Provided by LoyalBooks.com ---"]
