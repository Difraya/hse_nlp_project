name,bio
Fyodor_Dostoyevsky,"Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky was born on November 11, 1821, in
Moscow, Russia. He was the second of seven children of Mikhail
Andreevich and Maria Dostoevsky. His father, a doctor, was a member of
the Russian nobility, owned serfs and had a considerable estate near
Moscow where he lived with his family. It's believed that he was
murdered by his own serfs in revenge for the violence he would commit
against them while in drunken rages. As a child Fyodor was traumatized
when he witnessed the rape of a young female serf and suffered from
epileptic seizures. He was sent to a boarding school, where he studied
sciences, languages and literature. He was devastated when his favorite
writer, Alexander Pushkin, was killed
in a duel in St. Petersburg in 1837. That same year Dostoevsky's mother
died, and he moved to St. Petersburg. There he graduated from the
Military Engineering Academy, and served in the Tsar's government for a
year.Dostoevsky was active in St. Petersburg literary life; he grew out of
his early influence by Nikolay Gogol,
translated ""Eugenia Grande"" by
Honor√© de Balzac in 1844 and published
his own first novel, ""Poor Folk"", in 1845, and became friends with
Ivan Turgenev and
Nikolai A. Nekrasov, but it ended
abruptly after they criticized his writing. At that time he became
indirectly involved in a revolutionary movement, for which he was
arrested in 1849, convicted of treason and sentenced to death. His
execution was scheduled for a freezing winter day in St. Petersburg,
and at the appointed hour he was blindfolded and ordered to stand
before the firing squad, waiting to be shot. The execution was called
off at the last minute, however, and his sentence was commuted to a
prison term and exile in Siberia, where his health declined amid
increased epileptic seizures. After serving ten years in prison and
exile, he regained his title in the nobility and returned to St.
Petersburg with permission from the Tsar. He abandoned his formerly
liberal views and became increasingly conservative and religious. That,
however, didn't stop him from developing an acute gambling problem, and
he accumulated massive gambling debts.In 1862, after returning from his first major tour of Western Europe,
Dostoevsky wrote that ""Russia needs to be reformed, by learning the new
ideas that are developing in Europe."" On his next trip to Europe, in
1863, he spent all of his money on a manipulative woman, A. Suslova,
went on a losing gambling spree, returned home flat broke and sank into
a depression. At that time he wrote ""Notes from Underground"" (1864),
preceding existentialism in literature. His first wife died in 1864,
after six years of a childless marriage, and he adopted her son from
her previous marriage. Painful experiences caused him to fall further
into depression, but it was during this period that he wrote what many
consider his finest work: ""Crime and Punishment"" (1866).After completion of ""The Gambler"" (1867), the 47-year-old Dostoevsky
married his loyal friend and literary secretary, 20-year-old Anna
Snitkina, and they had four children. His first baby died at three
months of age, causing him to sink further into depression and
triggering more epileptic seizures. At that time Dostoevsky expressed
his disillusionment with the Utopian ideas in his novels ""The Idiot""
(1868) and ""The Devils"" (aka ""The Possessed"") (1871), where the ""devils""
are destructive people, such as revolutionaries and terrorists.
Dostoevsky was the main speaker at the opening of the monument to
Alexander Pushkin in 1880, calling Pushkin a ""wandering Russian,
searching for universal happiness"". In his final great novel, ""The
Brothers Karamazov"" (1880), Dostoevsky revealed the components of his
own split personality, depicted in four main characters; humble monk
Alyosha, compulsive gambler Dmitri, rebellious intellectual Ivan, and
their cynical father Fyodor Karamazov.Dostoevsky died on February 9, 1881, of a lung hemorrhage caused by
emphysema and epileptic seizures. He lived his entire life under the
pall of epilepsy, much like the mythical ""Sword of Damocles"", and was
fearless in telling the truth. His writings are an uncanny reflection
on his own life - the fate of a genius in Russia."
Dante_Alighieri,"Dante Alighieri was born in 1265 into the lower nobility of Florence,
to Alighiero di Bellincione d'Alighiero, a moneylender. A precocious
student, Dante's education focused on rhetoric and grammar. He also
became enamored with a young girl, Beatrice Portinari, whose death in
1290 threw a grieving Dante into intense religious studies. Though the
Alighieri family had managed to avoid entanglement in the power
struggles between the Ghibelline and Guelf families for control of
Florence, Dante allied himself with the democratic Guelfs and married a
member of that clan, Gemma di Manetto Donati, in 1285.After serving in the Guelf forces as a cavalryman in the Battle of
Campaldino, Dante enrolled in the Guild of Doctors and Pharmacists and
became politically active. He became an ambassador and a prior, but
after finding himself on the opposite side of the political party in
power he was forced to flee Florence in 1301, never able to return to
the city of his birth. He narrowly escaped being executed for treason.Dante left for Verona and Ravenna, where he was joined by his children.
He then wrote his most famous work, ""Commedia"", not in scholarly Latin
but in the vernacular Italian of the time, giving his countrymen a
literature of their own. In it he would resurrect the love of his
youth, Beatrice, giving her a place among the angels. This work would
also take the author, escorted by the Roman poet
Publius Vergilius Maro, on a
grand tour to Hell and Purgatory, and later by his beloved Beatrice to
Paradise. History would later judge Dante's creation to be divine.
Dante Alighieri died in 1321 and was buried in Ravenna. Three
sons--Pietro, Jacopo and Giovanni--and a daughter, Antonia, survived
him."
Lev_Tolstoy,"Count Lev Nikolaevich Tolstoy was born on September 9, 1828, in his
ancestral estate Yasnaya Polyana, South of Moscow, Russia. He was the
fourth of five children in a wealthy family of Russian landed Gentry.
His parents died when he was a child, and he was brought up by his
elder brothers and relatives.Leo Tolstoy studied languages and law at Kazan University for three
years. He was dissatisfied with the school and left Kazan without a
degree, returned to his estate and educated himself independently. In
1848 he moved to the capital, St. Petersburg, and there passed two
tests for a law degree. He was abruptly called to return to his estate
near Moscow, where he inherited 4000 acres of land and 350 serfs. There
Tolstoy built a school for his serfs, and acted as a teacher. He
briefly went to a Medical School in Moscow, but lost a fortune in
gambling, and was pulled out by his brother. He took military training,
became an Army officer, and moved to the Caucasus, where he lived a
simple life for three years with Cossacs. There he wrote his first
novel - ""Childhood"" (1852), it became a success. With writing ""Boyhood""
(1854) and ""Youth"" (1857) he concluded the autobiographical trilogy. In
the Crimean War (1854-55) Tolstoy served as artillery commander in the
Battle of Sevastopol, and was decorated for his courage. Between the
battles he wrote three stories titled ""Sevastopol Sketches"", that won
him wide attention, and a complement from the Czar Aleksandr II.After the war, Tolstoy returned to St. Petersburg, where he enjoyed the
friendship of Ivan Turgenev, Nikolai A. Nekrasov, Ivan Goncharov, and other writers. On his
trips to Europe, he had discussions with Gertsen in London, and
attended Darwin's lectures. In Brussels he had meetings with
philosophers Prudhon and Lelewel. Tolstoy undertook a research of
schools in Europe, and later he built and organized over 20 schools for
poor people in Russia. At that time the secret police began
surveillance, and searched his home. In 1862 he married Sofia Andreevna
Bers, and fathered 13 children with his wife. Four of their babies
died, and the couple raised the remaining nine children. His wife was
also his literary secretary, and also contributed to his best works,
""War and Peace"" (1863-69) and ""Anna Karenina"" (1873-77). In his
""Confession"" (1879) Tolstoy revealed his own version of Christianity,
blended with socialism, that won him many followers. Tolstoyan
communities sprang up in America and Europe, and he assisted the
Russian non-Orthodox Christians (Dukhobors) in migrating to USA and
Canada. He split from aristocratic class and developed an ascetic
lifestyle, becoming a vegetarian, and a farmer. He sponsored and
organized free meals for the poor. He transfered his copyright on all
of his writings after 1880 to public domain. In his later age Tolstoy
was pursuing the path of a wandering ascetic. He corresponded with
Mohandas K. Gandhi, who was directly influenced by Tolstoy's ""The Kingdom of God
is Within You"" (1894), which was praised by many nonviolent movements.In 1900 Tolstoy criticized the Tsar's government in a series of
publications, calling for separation of Chuch and State. Tsar Nicholas II
retaliated through the Church, by expulsion of Tolstoy from Orthodox
Cristianity as a ""heretic"". He fell ill, and suffered from a severe
depression; he was suicidal and even had to eliminate all hunting guns
from his home, because of his suicidal mode. He was treated by the
famous doctor Dahl, and was visited by composer Sergei Rachmaninoff and basso
Feodor Chaliapin Sr., who performed for Tolstoy on many occasions. Later he went to
convalesce in Yalta, in Crimea, where he spent time with Anton Chekhov and
Maxim Gorky. Tolstoy was an obvious candidate for the Nobel Prize in
Literature, but was initially omitted by the Nobel Committee for his
views. The omission caused a strong response from a group of Swedish
writers and artists. They sent an address to Tolstoy, but the writer
answered by declining any future prize nomination.In 1902 Tolstoy wrote a letter to the Tsar, calling for social justice,
to prevent a civil war, and in 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War,
Tolstoy wrote a condemnation of war. The Tsar replied by increasing
police surveillance on Tolstoy. In November of 1910 he left his estate,
probably taking the path of a wandering ascetic, which he had been
pursuing for decades. He left home without explanations and took a
train, in which he caught pneumonia, and died at a remote station of
Astapovo. He was laid to rest in his estate of Yasnaya Polyana, which
was made a Tolstoy National Museum.His youngest daughter, named Alexandra Tolstoy, was the director of the Tolstoy
Museum, and was arrested by the Communists five times. She emigrated
from Russia to the United States, where she founded the Tolstoy
Foundation. She helped many prominent Russian intellectuals, such as
Vladimir Nabokov and Sergei Rachmaninoff among many others."
Victor_Hugo,"Although Hugo was fascinated by poems from childhood on, he spent some
time at the polytechnic university of Paris until he dedicated all his
work to literature. He was one of the few authors who were allowed to
reach popularity during his own lifetime and one of the leaders of French
romance.After the death of his daughter Leopoldine in 1843, he started a
career in politics and became member of the Paris chamber where he
fought for leftist ideas. After the re-establishing of monarchy, he had to
go into exile to Guernesey (1851-1870) where his literary work became
more important, e.g. ""Les Miserables"" was written during that period.
After his return to Paris he did not join politics anymore."
William_Shakespeare,"William Shakespeare's birthdate is assumed from his baptism on April 25. His father John was the son of a farmer who became a
successful tradesman; his mother Mary Arden was gentry. He studied
Latin works at Stratford Grammar School, leaving at about age 15. About
this time his father suffered an unknown financial setback, though the
family home remained in his possession. An affair with Anne Hathaway,
eight years his senior and a nearby farmer's daughter, led to pregnancy
and a hasty marriage late in 1582. Susanna was born in May of 1583,
twins Hamnet and Judith in January of 1585. By 1592 he was an
established actor and playwright in London though his ""career path""
afterward (fugitive? butcher? soldier? actor?) is highly debated. When
plague closed the London theatres for two years he apparently toured;
he also wrote two long poems, ""Venus and Adonis"" and ""The Rape of
Lucrece"". He may have spent this time at the estate of the Earl of
Southampton. By December 1594 he was back in London as a member of the
Lord Chamberlain's Men, the company he stayed with the rest of his
life. In 1596 he seems to have purchased a coat of arms for his father;
the same year Hamnet died at age 11. The following year he purchased
the grand Stratford mansion New Place. A 1598 edition of ""Love's
Labors"" was the first to bear his name, though he was already
regarded as England's greatest playwright. He is believed to have
written his ""Sonnets"" during the 1590s. In 1599 he became a partner in
the new Globe Theatre, the company of which joined the royal household
on the accession of James in 1603. That is the last year in which he
appeared in a cast list. He seems to have retired to Stratford in 1612,
where he continued to be active in real estate investment. The cause of
his death is unknown."
Johann_Wolfgang_Von_Goethe,"Johann Wolfgang Goethe was born on 28 August 1749 in Frankfurt am Main,
Germany as son of a lawyer. After growing up in a privileged upper
middle class family, he studied law in Leipzig from 1765 to 1768,
although he was more interested in literature. As he was seriously ill,
he had to interrupt his studies, but finally graduated in Strassburg
with a degree in law. In the following years, his novel ""The Sorrows of
Young Werther"" (1774) became one of the first bestsellers, making him a
key author in the ""Sturm und Drang"" (Storm and Stress) movement. In
1775, he settled down in Weimar, being the Duke's adviser and writing
popular dramas such as ""Egmont"" or ""Torquato Tasso"". One of his life's
important milestones was the Italian Journey from 1786 and 1788, where
he discovered his interest in Greek and Roman classicism. After his
return to Germany, he began the ""Weimar Classicism"" movement with his
good friend Friedrich Schiller, concentrating on poems and dramas such as his best
known work ""Faust"", which he published in two parts (1808/1832). Beside
his literary work, he contributed many interesting theories to
sciences, making him Germany's leading polymath in that period. On 22
March 1832, he died in Weimar, the town he had lived for more than
fifty years."
Miguel_De_Cervantes_Saavedra,"Miguel de Cervantes' baptism occurred on October 9, 1547, at Alcala de
Henares, Spain, so it is reasonable to assume he was born around that
time, and Alcala de Henares has long claimed itself as his birthplace.
The son of Rodrigo de Cervantes, an itinerant and not-too-successful
surgeon, Miguel was educated by monks as he and his family wandered
from city to city. In 1570 he obtained a position as a kind of
secretary to Cardinal Aquaviva in Rome. In 1571 he became a soldier and
fought in the famous Battle of Lepanto that pitted Spain against
Turkish forces. Being ill with fever at the time, and wishing to prove
his bravery, he asked to be put in the most dangerous fighting position
on his ship. He was, and received two wounds in the chest and one in
his left hand, which rendered him disabled for life. Returning home
with his brother Rodrigo in 1575, they were captured by the Barbary
pirates and sold into slavery. He and his fellow captives made three
attempts to escape, all unsuccessful - one because they were betrayed
by a fellow captive. In each attempt Cervantes deliberately shouldered
the blame on himself, in an attempt to shield his fellow captives from
torture. The Turkish Bey was so impressed with his perhaps foolhardy
audacity that he spared him each time. The Cervantes family was able to
ransom Rodrigo but not Miguel, and he remained in captivity until 1580,
when he was finally ransomed by two Trinitarian friars.He then began a writing career, which was at first completely
unsuccessful due to the fact that Cervantes deliberately tried to write
the kind of plays and poetry popular at the time, and to imitate their
style, something he was woefully inadequate at doing. He fathered a
daughter out of wedlock, and entered into an unhappy marriage in 1584.
He took on a series of odd jobs to make ends meet. His financial
difficulties netted him three or more prison terms and an
excommunication by the Spanish Inquisition, although it was clear he
never committed any crimes. Finally, in 1605, he published the first
part of the novel which gave him immortality, the brilliant and
unforgettable ""Don Quixote de La Mancha"", which was supposed to be a
satire on the chivalric novels of the time, but was actually a work
unlike anything anyone else had ever written (the second part followed
ten years later, after the success of the first had produced a
plagiarized sequel that not only coarsened the satire but contained
openly insulting remarks about Cervantes). ""Don Quixote""'s surface
seems comic, but Cervantes, finally writing in his own personal style
and no one else's, created two characters, Don Quixote and Sancho
Panza, to whom he gives more multi-layered depth than anyone else up to
that time had given characters, except possibly the depth that
William Shakespeare had
given to Hamlet. The novel ""Don Quixote"" itself becomes an ironic
mixture of comedy, humiliation, disillusionment and tragedy. All of its
characters, except those in the interpolated romance novels, are
believable and each reacts to Don Quixote's madness in an illuminating
way. ""Don Quixote"" was immensely successful in its time, but it did not
make Cervantes a wealthy man.His other highly regarded works are his collection of ""Exemplary
Stories"", published in 1613, and his ""Eight Interludes"", published in
1615. He died of dropsy on April 23, 1616, but in an especially ironic
twist, his gravesite is lost. His contemporary, William Shakespeare,
died ten days later, which according to the Julian calendar then used
in England was, coincidentally, also April 23, 1616. Strangely enough,
to the end of his life, Cervantes valued his poetic work more highly
than his prose (perhaps just a case of wishful thinking) and never
considered ""Don Quixote"" his masterpiece. He died without knowing that
it would be one day regarded as the world's greatest novel by many
critics."
Italo_Calvino,"Italo Calvino was born on 15 October 1923 in Santiago de Las Vegas, Cuba. He was a writer, known for –ë–æ–∫–∫–∞—á—á–æ 70 (1962), Ti-Koyo e il suo pescecane (1962) and L'amore difficile (1962). He was married to Esther Calvino. He died on 19 September 1985 in Siena, Tuscany, Italy."
Stendhal,"A foremost French writer of the Romantic era, Stendhal was born
Marie-Henri Beyle in Grenoble, France in 1783. A loyal Bonapartist he
followed Napoleon closely during his military campaigns Stendhal's
novels reflect his intense love of Italy, his political convictions and
the moral and philosophical dilemmas of his time. His most popular
works Le Rouge et le Noir and La Chartreuse de Parme have been
transfered to the screen several time and show an immediacy which
transcends centuries."
Charles_Baudelaire,"Charles Baudelaire was a 19th century French poet, translator, and
literary/art critic. At his birth, Baudelaire's mother, Caroline
Archimbaut-Dufays, was 28; his father Francois Baudelaire was 61.
Charles' father instilled in him an appreciation for art, taking his
young son to museums and galleries, and teaching him to paint. When
Charles was six, his father died and Charles became very attached to
his mother, but when she remarried, he was sent to boarding school. The
school was ruled by military discipline which caused much of
Baudelaire's solitude and fits of crushing melancholy. Baudelaire
resented the strictures of his life and was, in turn, difficult and
rebellious. He frequently fought with students and teachers. He began
to write poems, which were not well received by his masters, who felt
them examples of precocious depravity, unsuitable for his age. He
eventually attended the College Louis-le-Grand, but was expelled in
April 1839.In an attempt to draw him away from the company he was keeping,
Baudelaire's stepfather sent him on a voyage to India in 1841.
Baudelaire jumped ship and eventually made his way back to France in
February of 1842. On his 21st birthday, Baudelaire received his
father's inheritance, but his lavish and extravagant lifestyle
(including use of hashish and opium) dwindled his fortune. He fell prey
to cheats and moneylenders, which led to heavy debt. He also contracted
the venereal disease that eventually took his life. His parents
obtained a court order to supervise his money and Charles received only
a small allowance. In 1842, Charles met a Creole woman named Jeanne
Duval, who became his mistress and dominated his life for the next 20
years. Jeanne would inspire Baudelaire's most anguished and sensual
love poetry, provoking such masterpieces of the exotic-erotic
imagination as ""La Chevelure"" (""The Head of Hair"").Baudelaire used his writing to shock and astonish society, likely
because of his strict upbringing and strong opposition to authority. He
often focused on the immoral and cynical. He felt that his ideas where
very similar to those of Edgar Allen Poe, who focused on beauty, death,
and the bizarre. Baudelaire began to translate volumes of Poe's work
into French, and much of Poe's popularity in England and France is
attributed to Baudelaire. In 1857, Baudelaire's most well-known work,
""Les Fleurs Du Mal"" (""The Flowers of Evil"") was seized by French
authorities and Baudelaire was forced to omit six poems and pay a fine;
today, it stands as perhaps the most influential poetry collection
published in Europe in the 19th century. He continued to publish
""salon"" studies and critical reviews of other artists, including
Flaubert's ""Madame Bovary"". In 1860, he began publishing prose poetry,
a poetic form unknown in France, and became renowned for his innovation
in prose experiments.Near the end of his life, Baudelaire's agonizing moods of isolation and
despair, which he called his moods of ""spleen,"" returned and became
more frequent. In 1867, while in Belgium, Baudelaire developed
hemiplegia and aphasia. He was brought back to Paris, where he
died."
Marcel_Proust,"Marcel Proust was a French intellectual, author and critic, best known
for his seven-volume fiction 'In search of Lost Time'. He coined the
term ""involuntary memory"", which became also known as ""Proust effect""
in modern psychology.He was born Valentin Louis Georges Eug√©ne Marcel Proust, on July 10,
1871, in Paris, France. His father, Achille Proust, was a famous
doctor. His mother, Jeanne Weil, was from a rich and cultured Jewish
family. Proust's interests in art and literature were encouraged by his
mother, who read and spoke English. He was fond of Carlyle, Emerson and
John Ruskin, whose two works he also translated into French. From age 9
Proust suffered from severe allergy and asthma attacks, and eventually
developed a chronic lung disease which caused his disability and
affected his career and mobility. He was lucky to survive such a life
threatening condition due to professional help from his doctor father.
Proust's physical disability imposed serious restrictions on his
lifestyle, and he expressed himself in writing. He was blessed with
talent and imagination and also with a very large inheritance, that
allowed him to write without any pressure. During the most years of his
adult life Proust was confined to his cork-wood paneled bedroom, where
he was attended mostly by his close friend, pianist and composer
Reynaldo Hahn.Proust's main work, 'A la recherche du temps perdu' was begun in 1909
and finished in 1922, just before the author's death. It also became
known in English as 'In Search of Lost Time' (aka.. Remembrance of
Things Past). The novel's life-like complexity and delicate fabric of
language is influenced by his reading of Lev Tolstoy, especially by 'War
and Peace' and 'Anna Karenina', and it bears some structural and
contentual resemblance of Tolstoy's major novels. It is spanning over
3000 pages in seven volumes and teeming with more than 2000 names.
Proust's novel is set in the fictional town of Combray, near Paris, and
covers all aspects of life of the upper class; nobility, sexuality,
women, men, art and culture. It was praised from Graham Greene, W. Somerset Maugham and
Ernest Hemingway, as being the greatest fiction of their time.Marcel Proust died at age 51, of complications related to pneumonia and
his chronic health condition, on November 18, 1922, and was laid to
rest in Cimeti√©re du P√©re-Lachaise, Paris, France. The town of Illiers,
which became the model for imaginary town of Combray in the novel, was
renamed Illiers-Combray in commemoration of the Proust's
masterpiece."
Giovanni_Boccaccio,"Giovanni Boccaccio was born in June 1313 in Certaldo, Florence, Tuscany, Italy. He was a writer, known for –ú–∞–ª—ã–µ —á–∞—Å—ã (2017), Decameron Nights (1953) and Decameron n¬∞ 3 - Le pi√π belle donne del Boccaccio (1972). He died on 21 December 1375 in Certaldo, Florence, Tuscany, Italy."
Alexander_Pushkin,"Born to noble parents (his father Sergei was a retired major, and his
mother, Nadezhda, was the granddaughter of an ennobled Ethiopian
general) on the 26th of May, 1799 in Moscow, Alexander Sergeevich
Pushkin became involved with a liberal underground revolutionary group
that saw him exiled to the Caucasus. He spent most of his time there writing poetry and novels. In 1826
Pushkin was pardoned by the Tsar and allowed to return home after six
years of exile. He married Natalia Goncharova, whose coquettish
behavior led to her husband challenging an admirer of hers to a duel in
January 1837. Though both were wounded, only Pushkin died two days
later from his injuries."
Jalaluddin_Muhammad_Rumi,"Jalaluddin Rumi, Scholar in Religious Sciences and famed Sufi Mystic
Poet, was born on September 29th 1207 A.D. in Balkh (modern day
Afghanistan). Escaping Mongol invasions he travelled extensively to
Muslim lands, Bagdad, Mecca, Damascus, Malatia (Turkey). Married Gevher
Khatun of Samarquand and moved to Quonya (Konya in present day Turkey).
Encountering the wandering dervish and Saint Shamsuddin Tabrezi, who
introduced him to the path of mystical and spiritual knowledge. Author
of six volumes of didactic epic works. His most famous work in seven
books and 24,660 couplets is written in Dari and Arabic and commonly
referred to as the ""Persian Quran"" by Jami. His son was killed with the
mystic dervish Shams. He himself died on December 16th 1273 A.D. and
his bier was followed by men of five faiths. The night became the
""Sebul Arus"" or ""Night of Union"", and ever since the Mawlawi Dervishes
celebrate this date as a Festival. Rumi leaves the world a legacy of
profound poetry and writings of the most intense spirituality and
simplicity ever to be written. Rumi's ""Divan-e-Shams"" and ""Mathnawi""
are his most popular works worldwide."
Franz_Kafka,"Franz Kafka was born into a German-speaking Jewish family in Prague,
Austrian Empire, in 1883. His father, Hermann Kafka, was a business
owner and a domestic tyrant, frequently abusing his son. Kafka later
admitted to his father, ""My writing was all about you..."". He believed
that his father broke his will and caused insecurity and guilt, that
affected his whole life. Their tensions come out in ""The Trial"" and in
""The Castle"" in form of a hopeless conflict with an overwhelming force.
His mother, Julie Lowy, came from an intellectual, spiritual family of
the Jewish merchant and brewer Jakob Lowy. Although her influence was
diminished by his dominating father, she shared her son's delicate
nature. Kafka had a few relationships with women and was engaged, but
never made a family.He finished the German National Gymnasium in 1901, and graduated from
the German University in Prague as Doctor of Law in 1906. He worked for
insurance companies for the rest of his life. His profession shaped the
formal, cold language of his writings which avoided any sentimental
interpretations, leaving it to the reader. In 1908 Kafka published
eight short stories compiled under the title ""Meditation"". In 1911 he
became interested in Yiddish theater, that absorbed him more than
abstract Judaism. In 1912 he began writing ""The Judgment"", which was
more than an autobiography, providing a therapeutical outlet for his
wrecked soul. The same year he started ""Metamorphosis"" about a
traveling salesman, who transformed into a giant bug. In 1914 he wrote
""In the Penal Colony"" and ""The Trial"", which is regarded to be his best
work. His style remains unique, though literary connections may be
traced to Edgar Allan Poe, E.T.A. Hoffmann and Nikolay Gogol, as well as to Chinese parables,
to the Bible and Talmud.As a Jew Kafka experienced social tensions and isolation from the
German community, so very few of his writings could find readers during
his life. His three sisters later died in the Nazi concentration camps.
He suffered from clinical depression, social anxiety, insomnia, and
tuberculosis, complicated by laryngitis, that caused him the loss of
his voice before his death in 1924. He was comforted by his girlfriend
Dora Diamant, who had broken away from her Hasidic shtetl in Poland.
She was 19 when they met in 1923 and Kafka wrote to her parents, asking
for their permission to marry her. Their answer was negative, because
Kafka presented himself as a non-religious Jew. He asked Dora to
destroy his manuscripts after his death, but she kept about 20
notebooks of his writings and 35 private letters, that were reportedly
confiscated by the Gestapo in 1933 and are not yet recovered. His
university friend Max Brod became his editor, biographer and literary
agent, who preserved and published most of Kafka's works posthumously,
including the unfinished novels ""The Trial"", ""The Castle"", and
""America""."
Anton_Chekhov,"Anton Pavlovich Chekhov was born in 1860, the third of six children to
a family of a grocer, in Taganrog, Russia, a southern seaport and
resort on the Azov Sea. His father, a 3rd-rank Member of the Merchant's
Guild, was a religious fanatic and a tyrant who used his children as
slaves. Young Chekhov was a part-time assistant in his father's
business and also a singer in a church choir. At age 15, he was
abandoned by his bankrupt father and lived alone for 3 years while
finishing the Classical Gymnazium in Taganrog. Chekhov obtained a
scholarship at the Moscow University Medical School in 1879, from which
he graduated in 1884 as a Medical Doctor. He practiced general medicine
for about ten years.While a student, Chekhov published numerous short stories and humorous
sketches under a pseudonym. He reserved his real name for serious
medical publications, saying ""medicine is my wife; literature - a
mistress."" While a doctor, he kept writing and had success with his
first books, and his first play ""Ivanov."" He gradually decreased his
medical practice in favor of writing. Chekhov created his own style
based on objectivity, brevity, originality, and compassion. It was
different from the mainstream Russian literature's scrupulous
analytical depiction of ""heroes."" Chekhov used a delicate fabric of
hints, subtle nuances in dialogs, and precise details. He described his
original style as an ""objective manner of writing."" He avoided
stereotyping and instructive political messages in favor of cool comic
irony. Praised by writers Lev Tolstoy and Nikolai Leskov, he was awarded the
Pushkin Prize from the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1888.In 1890, Chekhov made a lengthy journey to Siberia and to the remote
prison-island of Sakhalin. There, he surveyed thousands of convicts and
conducted research for a dissertation about the life of prisoners. His
research grew bigger than a dissertation, and in 1894, he published a
detailed social-analytical essay on the Russian penitentiary system in
Siberia and the Far East, titled ""Island of Sakhalin."" Chekhov's
valuable research was later used and quoted by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in his ""Gulag
Archipelago."" In 1897-1899, Chekhov returned to his medical practice in
order to stop the epidemic of cholera.Chekhov developed special relationship with Stanislavsky and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko at
the Moscow Art Theater. He emerged as a mature playwright who
influenced the modern theater. In the plays ""Uncle Vanya,"" ""Three
Sisters,"" ""Seagull,"" and ""Cherry Orchard,"" he mastered the use of
understatement, anticlimax, and implied emotion. The leading actress of
the Moscow Art Theater, Olga Knipper-Chekhova, became his wife. In 1898, Chekhov
moved to his Mediterranean-style home at the Black Sea resort of Yalta
in the Crimea. There he was visited by writers Lev Tolstoy, Maxim Gorky,
Ivan Bunin, and artists Konstantin Korovin and Isaac Levitan."
Gabriel_Garcia_Marquez,"Major Latin-American author of novels and short stories, a central
figure in the so-called magical realism movement in Latin American
literature. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1982.
Studied law and journalism in Bogot√° and Cartagena. He began his career
as a journalist in 1948, was a foreign correspondent in Europe during
the late 1950s, Cuba and N.Y. early 1960s, and a screenwriter,
journalist and publicist in Mexico City during the 1960s. During the
1980s he moved to Mexico when restrictions where imposed on his
continued traveling due to his left-view political views."
Umberto_Eco,"He is a professor of semiotics, the study of communication through
signs and symbols, at the University of Bologna. Also a philiosopher, a
historian, literary critic, and an aesthetician. He is an avid book
collector and owns more than 30,000 volumes. The subjects of his
scholarly investigations range from St. Thomas Aquinas, to James Joyce,
to Superman. He lives in Milan."
J_R_R_Tolkien,"English writer, scholar and philologist, Tolkien's father was a bank
manager in South Africa. Shortly before his father died (1896) his mother took
him and his younger brother to his father's native village of Sarehole,
near Birmingham, England. The landscapes and Nordic mythology of the
Midlands may have been the source for Tolkien's fertile imagination to
write about 'the Shire' and 'hobbits' in his later book the Hobbit
(1937). After his mother's death in 1904 he was looked after by Father
Francis Xavier Morgan a RC priest of the Congregation of the Oratory.
Tolkien was educated at King Edward VI school in Birmingham. He studied
linguistics at Exeter College, Oxford, and took his B.A. in 1915. In 1916 he fought in World War I with the Lancashire Fusiliers. It
is believed that his experiences during the Battle of the Somne may have
been fueled the darker side of his subsequent novels. Upon his return
he worked as an assistant on the Oxford English Dictionary (1918-20)
and took his M.A. in 1919. In 1920 he became a teacher in English at
the University of Leeds. He then went on to Merton College in Oxford,
where he became Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon
(1925-45) and Merton professor of English Language and Literature
(1945-59). His first scholarly publication was an edition of Sir Gawain
and the Green Knight (1925). He also wrote books on Chaucer (1934) and
Beowulf (1937). In 1939 Tolkien gave the Andrew Lang Lecture at the
University of St. Andrews in Scotland titled: ""On Fairy-Stories"".
Tolkien will however be remembered most for his books the Hobbit (1937)
and the Lord of the Rings (1954-55). The Hobbit began as a bedtime
story for his children"". He wrote Lord of the Rings over a period of about 14 years.Tolkien also discussed parts of his novels with fellow Oxfordian and
fantasy writer CS Lewis during their 'meetings'. He was trying to
create a fantasy world so that he could explain how he had invented
certain languages, and in doing so created 'Middle-earth'. However
among his peers at Oxford his works were not well received as they were
not considered 'scholarly'. It was after LOTR was published in
paperback in the United States in 1965 that he developed his legendary
cult following and also imitators. Tolkien was W. P. Ker lecturer at
Glasgow University in 1953. In 1954 both the University of Liege and
University College, Dublin, awarded him honorary doctorates. He
received the CBE in 1972. He served as vice-president of the
Philological Society and was a Fellow of the Royal Society of
Literature. He was made an honorary fellow of Exeter College. Despite the immense
popularity of his books today Tolkien did not greatly benefit from
their sales. His son Christopher Tolkien was able to publish some of
his works posthumously after his manuscripts were found."
William_Faulkner,"William Faulkner, one of the 20th century's most gifted novelists,
wrote for the movies in part because he could not make enough money
from his novels and short stories to support his growing number of
dependants. The author of such acclaimed novels as ""The Sound and the
Fury"" and ""Absalom, Absalom!"", Faulkner received official screen
credits for just six theatrical releases, five of which were with
director Howard Hawks. Faulkner received the Nobel Prize for Literature for
1949 and he received two Pulitzer Prizes, for ""A Fable"" in '1955 and
""The Reivers"", which was published shortly before he died in
1962."
Aesop,"Greek slave. Many of the 200+ fables attributed to him may not have
been his own, but since his name is synonymous with fables they were
credited to him anyway. Sentenced to death for heresy. Was thrown from
the edge of a cliff, c. 560 BC. The excepted dates of his birth and
death would mean that he lived to around 60, remarkable for his
time."
Arthur_Rimbaud,"Arthur Rimbaud was born on 20 October 1854 in Charleville-M√©zi√®res, Ardennes, France. He was a writer, known for Ein gro√üer graublauer Vogel (1970), Ardiente paciencia (1983) and –ö—Ä–∏–º–∏–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –ª—é–±–æ–≤–Ω–∏–∫–∏ (1999). He died on 10 November 1891 in Marseille, Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne, France."
Aristophanes,"Ancient Greek poet and comic dramatist Aristophanes was the son of
Philippus of Athens. A leading exponent of the Athenian ""Old Comedy,""
Aristophanes lived most of his life during the Peloponnesian War
against Sparta (431-404). Some of his works include ""Acharnians"" (425),
""Knights"" (424), ""In the Clouds"" (423), ""In the Wasps"" (422), ""The
Peace"" (421), ""The Birds"" (414), ""In Lysistrata"" (411), ""The
Thesmophoriazusae"" (411), ""In the Frogs"" (405; it won the first prize
at the Lenaean festival), ""In the Ecclesiazusae"" (392) and ""In the
Plutus"" (388). He is the only exponent of the Athenian Old Comedy who
has left us complete plays. In his day comic plays were performed at
Athens annually at the festivals of Dionysus and Lenaea, at which
occasions five poets competed, each producing a single play. The
targets of Aristophanes' humor includes notable politicians (Pericles,
Cleon, Hyperbolus), poets (Euripides) and
philosophers (Socrates), to name a
few. Aristophanes often makes fun of cultural innovators (although the
construction of his plays shows that he was one of them himself),
whereas the characters with whom he expresses sympathy are usually
people who just want to be left to enjoy themselves in traditional
ways."
Ivan_Turgenev,"Ivan Turgenev was born into a wealthy landowning family with many
serfs, in the city of Oryol in Southern Russia. His father, a cavalry
colonel, died when he was 15, and he was raised by his abusive mother,
who ruled her 5000 serfs ruthlessly with a whip. He never married, but
fathered a daughter with one of their family serfs. Turgenev studied at
Universities of Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Berlin, and later in his
life received a Doctorate degree from Oxford. Turgenev lived in Western
Europe for most of his life and admired the advancements of the Western
civilization. He advocated modernization of Russia and liberation of
serfs. In ""A Sportsman's Sketches"" (1852) he bitterly criticized
serfdom, and in ""A Nest of Nobles"" (1859), and ""On the Eve"" he focused
on the social and political troubles brewing in Russia. In his
masterpiece ""Fathers and Sons"" (1862) Turgenev presented a man of the
new generation, an educated and open-minded medical student Basarov, in
a conflict with the old generation of 'fathers', who are standing for
the ultra-conservative Russia. After being wildly attacked by Russian
critics, Turgenev retired in Europe, living in Baden-Baden and Paris
where he had a life-long affair with the celebrated singer Pauline
Garcia-Viardot. His late stories ""First Love"", ""Asya"", ""Torrents of
Spring"", and a collection of ""Poetry in Prose"" are among the finest in
all of the Russian literature. He died in Bougival, near Paris, and was
buried in St. Petersburg, Russia. Turgenev's influence may be found in
Western literature; in the works of
Gustave Flaubert, and also
Ernest Hemingway, who regarded ""A
Sportsman's Sketches"" as his favorite book. ."
Sophocles,"Versatile Greek poet and tragic dramatist. He was the son of Sophilus,
a wealthy arms manufacturer. Sophocles studied tragedy under Aeschylus,
whom he subsequently defeated in the dramatic festival of 468 BC, thus
gaining his first victory at these competitions. He became a general
under Nicias and after the failure of the Athenian expedition to
Syracuse (413) was appointed one of the special commissioners to deal
with the emergency. He was a priest of Amynos, a god of healing, and
offered his own house as a place of worship for the healing deity
Asclepius until his temple was ready. In addition, he founded a
literary and musical society. His descendants were also tragedians -
his son Iophon and grandson Sophocles the younger. Unlike his rival
Euripides, he had very early acquired a favorable public. About 130
plays were attributed to him, (7 of which were subsequently reckoned
spurious). In the dramatic competitions he probably won 24
victories--that is to say, 24 of his tetralogies (each comprising 3
tragedies and a satyr play) were successful. Seven of his tragedies
have survived viz. Ajax, Antigone, Oedipus Rex, Electra, the Trachinian
Women, Philoctetes and Oedipus at Colonus (his last play performed in
401 after his death). Sophocles died just before the catastrophic end
of the Peloponnesian War."
Moliere,"Born between January 13 and January 15 of the year 1622, from a 25yo
tapestry-maker, Jean Poguelin (who worked for the King of France from
1631), and a 20yo woman, Marie Cres√©, in Paris, Jean-Baptiste Poquelin
lost his mother when he was 10. From 1638 to 1640, he studied in the
Jesuit college of Clermont, then started a brief lawyer career and
pursued his father's work under Louis XIII, especially in Narbonne,
until the King's death in 1643, when Jean-Baptiste co-founded
L'Illustre Th√©√¢tre, installed at the jeu de paume des M√©tayers
(faubourg Saint-Germain, Paris). He chose his nom-de-plume Moli√®re in
1644 but his company had some financial difficulties due to a lack of
success: Moli√®re was imprisoned twice in 1645 for debts. The troupe
moved several times in different parts of France (Lyon, Grenoble,
Dijon, Narbonne...) and they became the troupe of the Prince de Conti
in 1653 (in P√©zenas, Languedoc).In 1654, Moli√®re presented his first play, ""L'Etourdi"", in Lyon, then
""Le D√©pit amoureux"" in B√©ziers in 1656. But the same year the troupe
lost its grants from de Conti, who was becoming extremely unfavorable
to theater creation. Back to Paris in 1658, under the protection of the
King's brother, they played ""Nicom√®de"" and ""Le Docteur amoureux"" at the
Vieux-Louvre in front of the King (Louis XIV) and his court. Louis XIV
offered Moli√®re to play at the Petit-Bourbon where his first 2 plays
eventually had great success. In 1659, Moli√®re presented his third
play, ""Les Pr√©cieuses Ridicules"". After his younger brother's death,
Moli√®re re-took in charge the familial tapestry-making business and
kept it until his death. The same year, he presented ""Sganarelle ou le
Cocu imaginaire"" and the troupe was moved to the Palais-Royal. Rival
comedians tried to divide Moli√®re's troupe but failed. Moli√®re
successively presented ""L'Ecole des maris"" in 1661 and ""L'Ecole des
femmes"" in 1662.He married Armande B√©jart in 1662 (the year Moli√®re and his troupe were
accepted at the King's court), they had a son Louis in 1664 (Louis XIV
was his godfather) but the latter died before his first birthday. The
same year, members of the Compagnie du Saint-Sacrement tried to ban
Moli√®re's play ""Le Tartuffe"" but it was shown in May. Moli√®re's troupe
also presented Jean Racine's first play ""La Theba√Øde"" then ""Alexandre"" the
following year, but the troupe learnt that Racine made his play been
performed elsewhere too, which brought a tension between the two
authors. Armande gave birth to their daughter Esprit-Madeleine in 1665.
Moli√®re premiered ""Dom Juan"" in 1665, ""Le Misanthrope"" and ""Le M√©decin
malgr√© lui"" in 1666. In 1667 the troupe plaid Pierre Corneille's ""Attila"" and
Moli√®re's ""L'Imposteur"", which was only presented once because
immediately banned. Moli√®re had his first health problems. The troupe
presented ""Amphitryon"", ""George Dandin"" and ""L'Avare"" in 1668,
""Tartuffe"" again in 1669 (the year Moli√®re's father died), ""Le
Bourgeois Gentilhomme"" in 1670, ""Les Fourberies de Scapin"" and ""Psych√©""
in 1671, ""Les Femmes savantes"" in 1672.Moli√®re had a quarrel with Jean-Baptiste Lully in 1672 over the right of using
music in plays since Lully ruled the music utilization with his
""acad√©mie royale de musique"". Moli√®re's second son,
Pierre-Jean-Baptiste-Armand, was born the same year but died a few days
after his baptism. In February 1673, during the 4th performance of his
last play, ""Le Malade Imaginaire"", Moli√®re fell and died a few hours
later in his house (rue de Richelieu, Paris). His wife obtained from
the King the right to bury his corpse in a cemetery, which was normally
unauthorized for a comedian. Her daughter was his only child to live
long enough to have children but didn't, therefore Moli√®re had no
direct descendants."
Charles_Dickens,"Charles Dickens' father was a clerk at the Naval Pay Office, and
because of this the family had to move from place to place: Plymouth,
London, Chatham. It was a large family and despite hard work, his
father couldn't earn enough money. In 1823 he was arrested for debt and
Charles had to start working in a factory, labeling bottles for six
shillings a week. The economy eventually improved and Charles was able
to go back to school. After leaving school, he started to work in a
solicitor's office. He learned shorthand and started as a reporter
working for the Morning Chronicle in courts of law and the House of
Commons. In 1836 his first novel was published, ""The Pickwick Papers"".
It was a success and was followed by more novels: ""Oliver Twist""
(1837), ""Nicholas Nickleby"" (1838-39) and ""Barnaby Rudge"" (1841). He
traveled to America later that year and aroused the hostility of the
American press by supporting the abolitionist (anti-slavery) movement.
In 1858 he divorced his wife Catherine, who had borne him ten children.
During the 1840s his social criticism became more radical and his
comedy more savage: novels like ""David Copperfield"" (1849-50), ""A Tale
of Two Cities"" (1959) and ""Great Expectations"" (1860-61) only increased
his fame and respect. His last novel, ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"", was
never completed and was later published posthumously."
Maxim_Gorky,"Maksim Gorky is a pseudonym of Aleksei Maksimovich Peshkov, who was
born into a poor Russian family in Nizhnii Novgorod on Volga river.
Gorky lost his father at an early age, he was beaten by his stepfather
and became an orphan at age 9, when his mother died. He was brought up
by his grandmother, who helped his development as a storyteller.He was blessed with a brilliant memory, but failed to enter a
University of Kazan. At age 19 he survived a suicide attempt, because
the bullet missed his heart. After that Gorky traveled on foot for 5
years all over Central Russia, worked as a sailor on a Volga steamboat,
then a salesperson, a railway worker, a salt miller, and a lawyer's
clerk. At that time he was arrested for his public criticism of the
Tsar and social injustices in Russia. He started writing for newspapers
and published his first 'Sketches and Stories' in 1890s. Later he wrote
an autobiographic book ""My Universities"" based on impressions from his
travels and jobs. Gorky wrote with sympathy about the simple folks, the
outcasts, the gypsies, the hobos and dreamers in the context of social
decay in the Russian Empire. He became friends with Anton Chekhov and
Lev Tolstoy. His play 'The Lower Depths' (1892) was praised by Chekhov and
was successfully played in Europe and the United States. His political
activism resulted in cancellation of his membership in the Russian
Academy. Anton Chekhov and Vladimir Korolenko left the Academy in protest and solidarity
with Gorky. He went to live in Europe and America in 1906-13. In
America he started his classic novel, 'The Mother', about a Russian
Christian woman and her imprisoned son, who both joined revolutionaries
under the illusion that revolution follows Christ's messages.After the Russian revolution in 1917, Gorky criticized Lenin and
communists for their ""bloody experiments on the Russian people"". He
wrote, 'Lenin and Trotsky are corrupted with the dirty poison of power.
They are disrespectful of human rights, freedom of speech and all other
civil liberties"". Soon Gorky received a handwritten warning letter from
Lenin. Later his friend Nikolai Gumilev, ex-husband of Anna Akhmatova was
executed by communists. In 1921 Gorky emigrated to Europe and settled
in Capri. He became careful in his critique of communism. In 1932 after
a series of brief visits, he returned to
Soviet Russia. He was placed in a rich Moscow mansion of the former
railroad tycoon Ryabushinsky. His return from the fascist Italy was a victory for Soviet
propaganda. He was made the Chairman of the Soviet Writer's Union, and
a figurehead of ""socialist realism"" . After the murder of Kirov in 1934
Gorky was under a house arrest. His son died in 1935. The following year Gorki
Gorky died suddenly at the Lenin's dacha in Moscow."
George_Orwell,"Born the son of an Opium Agent in Bengal, Eric Blair was educated in
England (Eton 1921). The joined the British Imperial Police in Burma,
serving until 1927. He then travelled around England and Europe, doing
various odd jobs to support his writing. By 1935 he had adopted the
'pen-name' of 'George Orwell' and had written his first novels. He
married in 1936. In 1937, he and his wife fought against the Fascists
in the Spanish Civil War. He produced some 3000 pages of essays and
newspaper articles as well as several books and programs for the
BBC."
Edgar_Allan_Poe,"Edgar Allan Poe was born on January 19, 1809, in Boston, Massachusetts.
His father, named David Poe Jr., and his mother, named Elizabeth Arnold
Hopkins Poe, were touring actors. Both parents died in 1811, and Poe
became an orphan before he was 3 years old. He was adopted by John
Allan, a tobacco merchant in Richmond, Virginia, and was sent to a
boarding school in London, England. He later attended the University of
Virginia for one year, but dropped out and ran up massive gambling
debts after spending all of his tuition money. John Allan broke off
Poe's engagement to his fianc√©e Sarah Royster. Poe was heartbroken,
traumatized, and broke. He had no way out and enlisted in the army in
May of 1827. At the same time Poe published his first book, ""Tamerlane
and Other Poems"" (1827). In 1829, he became a West Point cadet, but was
dismissed after 6 months for disobedience. By that time he published
""Al Aaraf"" (1929) and ""Poems by Edgar A. Poe"" (1831), with the funds
contributed by his fellow cadets. His early poetry, though written in
the manner of Lord Byron, already shows the musical effects of his
verses.Poe moved in with his widowed aunt, Maria Clemm, and her teenage
daughter, Virginia Eliza Clemm, whom he married before she was 14 years
old. He earned respect as a critic and writer. In his essays ""The
Poetic Principle"" and ""The Philosophy of Composition,"" Poe formulated
important literary theories. But his career suffered from his
compulsive behavior and from alcoholism. He did produce, however, a
constant flow of highly musical poems, of which ""The Raven"" (1845) and
""The Bells"" (1849) are the finest examples. Among his masterful short
stories are ""Ligeia"" (1838), ""The Fall of the House of Usher""(1839) and
""The Masque of the Red Death"". Following his own theory of creating ""a
certain unique or single effect"", Poe invented the genre of the
detective story. His works: ""The Murder in the Rue Morgue"" (1841) is
probably the first detective story ever published.Just when his life began to settle, Poe was devastated by the death of
his wife Virginia in 1847. Two years later he returned to Richmond and
resumed a relationship with his former fianc√©e, Sarah Royster, who, by
that time, was a widow. But shortly after their happy reconciliation he
was found unconscious on a street in Baltimore. Poe was taken to the
Washington College Hospital where Doctor John Moran diagnosed ""lesions
on the brain"" (the Doctor believed Poe was mugged). He died 4 days
later, briefly coming in and out of consciousness, just to whisper his
last words, ""Lord, help my poor soul."" The real cause of his death is
still unknown and his death certificate has disappeared. Poe's critic
and personal enemy, named Rufus Griswold, published an insulting
obituary; later he visited Poe's home and took away all of the writer's
manuscripts (which he never returned), and published his ""Memoir"" of
Poe, in which he forged a madman image of the writer.The name of the woman in Poe's poem ""Annabel Lee"" was used by Vladimir Nabokov
in 'Lolita' as the name for Humbert's first love, Annabelle Leigh.
Nabokov also used in 'Lolita' some phrases borrowed from the poem of
Edgar Allan Poe. ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" was set to music by
Claude Debussy as an opera. Sergei Rachmaninoff created a musical tribute to Poe by making
his favorite poem ""The Bells"" into the eponymous Choral
Symphony."

Julio_Cortazar,"One of the most important Argentinian writers of all time, Julio
Cortazar was born in Belgium. When he was a child he went with his
parents to Argentina. She stayed in Buenos Aires until 1951, when he
went to Paris and he stayed in France until his death. His first book
of short stories was ""Bestiario"" published in 1951. After this, he
wrote many books of short stories like ""Final del Juego"" (1956), ""Todos
los fuegos el fuego"" (1966), ""Las armas secretas"" (1964). In this last
book he wrote the story ""El perseguidor"" based in the life of the great
alto sax player Charlie Parker. His most celebrated book was the novel
""Rayuela"" (1963). His short story ""Las Babas del Diablo"" was adapted by

Oscar_Wilde,"A gifted poet, playwright, and wit; Oscar Wilde was a phenomenon in 19th-century England. He was illustrious for preaching the importance of style in life and art, and of attacking Victorian narrow-mindedness.Wilde was born in Dublin, Ireland. He studied at Trinity College in Dublin, before leaving the country to study at Oxford
University in England when he was in his early 20s. His prodigious literary talent was recognized when he received the Newdegate Prize for his outstanding poem ""Ravenna"". After leaving university, he began to cause a sensation, using sheer force of personality, as he published his first volume of poetry, ""Patience"", in 1881, followed by a play, ""The Duchess of Padua"", two years later.On his arrival in America, he stirred the nation with his flamboyancy: wearing silk stockings, and sporting long, flowing hair, which gave the impression, to many, of an effeminate, and he bore a general air of wittiness, sophistication, and eccentricity. He was an instant celebrity, but his works did not find recognition until the publication of ""The Happy Prince and Other Tales"" (1888). His other noted work was his only novel, ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" (1890), which caused controversy, because it evidently attacked the hypocrisy of England, and its' obvious homosexual content was later used as incriminating evidence at Wilde's trial.Wilde was married, and he had two children, but he was also a gay man. He had an affair with a young aristocrat named Lord Alfred Douglas. Douglas' father, the Marquess of Queensberry, did not approve of his son's relationship with the distinguished writer, and when he accused Wilde of sodomy, Wilde sued him for libel. However, his case was dismissed when his homosexuality--which at the time was outlawed in England--was exposed. He was, as a result, arrested for 'gross indecency', tried, and sentenced to two years hard labor. Upon his release, he was penniless, and he was, as a result, reduced to living off of the generosity of friends, and of his wife, from whom he lived in a socially dictated separation. He did, however, begin to display some of his former glory in his efforts to reinvent himself as a kind of expos√© writer and commentator, though his worthwhile, honest efforts were mostly unsuccessful, due to the prejudice his sentencing had caused, and that led him to understandable displays of dejection. He died in a Paris hotel room, just over three years after his release, likely from an ear injection contracted in prison. He was 46.Wilde is immortalized through his works, which remain popular, and have been, and continue to be, interpreted on stage, in films, and on television.Wilde was finally pardoned by the British government in 2017."
Jean_De_La_Fontaine,"Born in July 8, 1621, in Ch√¢teau-Thierry (Champagne, France), where his
father was in charge of Water, Forests and Hunting, Jean de la Fontaine
spent his whole childhood and adolescence in the countryside, where he
mainly studied Latin language. In 1641, he moved to Paris to continue
his study at the Oratoire, rue St Honor√©. But he stayed there only for
18 months because he didn't like it. Then he studied law and became a
lawyer at the Parliament of Paris in 1649. Before that his father
married him to 14-years-old Marie H√©ricart in 1647. They later had a
son, Charles, in 1653. Then he decided to become a writer and first published l'Eunuque, in
1654, translated from Terentius's old version, then a heroic poem,
Adonis, in 1658, inspired by Ovid. The latter work allowed him to
have the admiration and protection of Nicolas Fouquet. But in 1661,
while La Fontaine was writing Le Songe de Vaux, Fouquet was disgraced,
arrested and put in jail by the king. Thus La Fontaine lost his
protection and was pursued for royal disgrace because of his
faithfulness with Fouquet, for who he wrote several poems including
√âl√©gie aux nymphes de Vaux. Thus he left Paris for the Limousin.When he came back to Paris, his career restarted with the publication
of his Contes (divided in 5 books) from 1664 to 1674, his 243 Fables
from 1668 and his novel les amours de Psych√© et Cupidon in 1669. He
successively found the protection of the Duchesse de Bouillon, the
Duchesse d'Orl√©ans, Mme de La Sabli√®re and finally Madame Hervart.
Elected at the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1683, his passion for ancient
Greece and Rome brought him on the Ancients side during the century's
quarrel between Ancients and Moderns. He had a quite brilliant social
life and regularly saw the most famous writers of his time: Perrault,
Mme de S√©vign√©, Boileau, Moli√®re, Racine and La Rochefoucauld.Nevertheless during the last two years of his life he gave up with
social life, was obliged to deny some of his work and devoted himself
to meditation. That's how he died in 1695. Nowadays some people still
say that Jean de la Fontaine copied everything he wrote (especially the
fables of Aesop and Phaedrus) but others defend him by saying that he
generally improved them and he also made us know the ancient authors he
liked and who would have been probably forgotten without him. ."
Rainer_Maria_Rilke,"Rainer Maria Rilke was born in Prague on the 4th of December 1878 as
the son of a military man working with railroads. After he visited a
military Upper School he tried to avoid the army and did the
preparations for the final exams and the final exams in private. He
went to university to study literature and art. Rilke left Germany for
a journey to Russia which had a big influenced on him. He settled down
1900 in Worpswede, a German village with artists only, most of them
painters. He married one of them, Clara Westhoff, but the marriage was
divorced in 1902. After journeys to Spain, North Africa, Egypt and
France he finally found a man with money: After World War One he
settled down in Switzerland in a castle owned by Werner Reinhart, but
free to use for him. On the 29th of December 1926 he died in a sanatory
in Valmont on Leucaemia. Rilke made some important contributions to the
German literature. His work, including the novel ""Malte Laurids Brigge""
and many famous poems, are the standing examples of the literary
""Jugendstil"", an epoche in which the authors tried to reflect their
inner views."
Lord_Byron,"Lord Byron seemed destined from birth to tragedy. His father was the
handsome but feckless Captain John ""Mad Jack"" Byron and his mother the
Scottish heiress Catherine Gordon, the only child of the Laird of
Gight.Captain Byron abandoned his wife and child leaving Catherine to bring
up young Byron on her own. A harsh and dependent parent, Catherine was
just the wrong sort of person to raise a sensitive child, clinging to
him one moment, and the next denouncing Byron as a ""lame brat."" Born
with a club foot, Byron (no-one ever called him George) was kept
separated from peers and his elder half-sister, Augusta, by his
over-protective mother. At fourteen he fell in love with a neighbor,
Mary Chaworth, and wrote love poetry to her. Byron was heartbroken,
however, when he overheard Mary callously call him ""that little lame
boy"" while talking to a friend.Always deeply sensitive about his deformity, he finally received
adequate medical care in his teens which corrected the problem. A
hedonist in school, Byron was popular and outgoing, though by his own
admission he did very little schoolwork. The publication of his poem,
""Childe Harold"", prompted Byron to remark famously, ""I awoke one day to
find myself famous."" When a distant cousin died, Byron unexpectedly
found himself heir to the baronetcy, at which point he became the 6th
Baron Byron. The most popular person in Regency London, he wrote more
poetry and carried on illicit affairs, most notably with Lady Caroline
Lamb, who inspired one of his best and shortest poems: ""Caro Lamb,
Goddamn.""After the spectacular flaming disintegration of his relationship with
Caroline, a woman stepped into his life who would become his greatest
love and the cause of his eventual downfall -- his half-sister,
Augusta. Augusta occupied the central place in his heart, and he wrote
many passionate poems in her honor.On April 15th, 1814, Augusta gave birth to Elizabeth Medora Leigh.
Byron was ecstatic over the birth of the girl, who was nicknamed
""Libby"". The child bore the name Leigh, and Augusta's husband, her
cousin Colonel George Leigh, apparently had no suspicions regarding her
paternity. Libby herself claimed in her autobiography she was always a
favorite of the Colonel's.Augusta herself pressured her brother Byron to wed, in order to avert a
scandal. He reluctantly chose the intelligent and confident Annabella
Milbanke, a cousin of his old flame Caroline Lamb. Enamoured with her
handsome husband, Annabella even became friendly with Augusta, but it
was not long before her marriage began to fall apart. Byron treated her
coldly, and was very disappointed when their only child, Ada Byron, was
not a boy.Byron went into self-imposed exile in Italy, though he remained in
contact with Augusta. Byron befriended fellow rogue poet Percy Bysshe
Shelley, who had shocked the world by running away and living in sin
with Mary Wollenstonecraft Godwin (better known as Mary Shelley, author
of ""Frankenstein""). Percy and Mary joined Byron for the summer at
Geneva, accompanied by Mary's stepsister, Claire Clairmont. Byron and
Claire had a brief romance, which resulted in daughter Allegra, who
Byron raised himself. Allegra saw little of her mother, and referred to
Byron's Italian mistress as ""mamma"". When Allegra died at the age of
six in 1822, Claire was enraged and refused to have anything to do with
Byron ever again. Depressed by both his daughter's death and the
drowning of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Byron took up a new cause - that of
Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire. Summoning support, he
arrived in Greece with weapons and supplies, but before he could join
the fight, went down with a deadly fever. He died in 1824, and his last
words were, ""My daughter! My sister!"""
Hans_Christian_Andersen,"Andersen experienced an unhappy childhood marked by deep poverty. When he was 14 years old, he left his parents' home and fled alone to Copenhagen. Here the director of the Royal Theater, Jonas Collin, took care of the child and gave him shelter and work. With his help, the young Hans Christian Andersen was also able to attend school. Inspired by his theater work, he began to write his first plays, which he later wanted to expand into stage plays. The first stories, stories and poems were created at this time. In 1822, Andersen's first plots were published with great success. He became a recognized writer in 1829 with his fantastic stories, which were entirely based on the example of the German writer Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann.Andersen's debut novel, ""The Improviser"", was written in 1835 and received extremely positive reviews from critics. The Danish philosopher and writer S√∂ren Kierkegaard was critical of him in his 1837 work ""Only a Violinist"". From 1839 Andersen was provided with a state poet's salary. As a result, financially secure, he traveled to Europe, Asia and Africa. However, he spent most of his time in Germany. He recorded his adventures and experiences in dramas, novels and travel books. Anderson became a literary figure with worldwide recognition through his precise portrayal of individual characters, which the writer wrote in everyday language that was atypical at the time. The secret fears and longings of the characters were portrayed, and their exemplary behavior also represented an educational goal.During his literary work, Andersen wrote some of the most popular children's stories of modern times. Andersen's collected fairy tales and poems were published between 1835 and 1848 under the Danish title ""Eventyr, fortalte for b√∏rn"". His most successful stories include ""The Ugly Duckling"", ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", ""The Snow Queen"" and ""The Princess and the Pea"". Andersen's extensive legacy includes over 150 fairy tales, including ""The Little Mermaid"", which gave rise to the sculpture of the same name in memory of him in the harbor of Copenhagen. Andersen's stories have been translated into over 80 languages and served as plays, ballets, picture books and later as successful films.Hans Christian Andersen died on August 4, 1875 in Copenhagen."
Thomas_Mann,"Thomas Mann was probably Germany's most influential author of the 20th
century, receiving the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1929. Born on 6
June 1875 in L√ºbeck, his family moved to Munich in 1893, where he lived
until 1933 and wrote some of his most successful novels like
""Buddenbrocks"" (1901), ""Death in Venice"" (1912) or ""The Magic Mountain""
(1924). After the Nazi takeover, the humanist and anti-fascist, married
to Katia Pringsheim, daughter of a secular Jewish family, emigrated to
Switzerland, then to Princeton and Pacific Palisades in the United
States, where he finished his great tetra-logy ""Joseph and His
Brothers"" in 1942. Two years later, he became a naturalized US citizen,
but finally returned to Europe in 1952. The famous analyst and critique
of the German and European soul died on 12 August 1955 in Kilberg near
Zurich."
Alexandre_Dumas,"His paternal grandparents were Marie Cessete Dumas (a Haitian slave)
and Marquis Antoine Davy de la Pailleterie. Antoine disapproved of
their son, Thomas-Alexandre, joining the French army under the ""Davy de
la Pailleterie"" name, so Thomas-Alexandre used his mother's surname
instead. He became a valued general of Napoleon, and after he married
the daughter of a local tavern owner, Thomas-Alexandre had a son of his
own. This son was Alexandre Dumas, who became world-famous as the
author of ""The Three Musketeers"" and ""The Count of Monte
Cristo""."
James_Joyce,"Joyce was born at 41 Brighton Square, Rathgar, Dublin, on 2 February 1882. His father invested unwisely, and the family's fortunes declined
steadily. Joyce graduated from University College Dublin (UCD), in 1902. He briefly studied medicine in Paris but his mother's impending death from cancer brought him back to Dublin. In 1904, Joyce began ""Stephen Hero"", which he later re-worked as ""A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"". He also met Nora Barnacle, a chambermaid, and on 16 June 1904 they went walking at Ringsend, at the Liffey's mouth; Joyce later chose that date for the events recorded in Ulysses.Having briefly shared a Martello tower at Sandycove, County Dublin, with Oliver St. John Gogarty, he sailed from Dublin with Nora in October 1904. Joyce found work in a language school in Trieste. In 1909, he made two trips to Dublin, to arrange publication
of Dubliners, and to open a short-lived cinema. His last visit was in 1912, when he failed to overcome his publisher's doubts about
Dubliners. In 1914 the book was published in England, and ""A Portrait"" was serialised in a London magazine. With the outbreak of World War I, Joyce moved to Zurich in neutral Switzerland, where, in 1917, he underwent the first of many operations for glaucoma. ""Ulysses"", his
masterpiece, was serialised in New York in 1918-20, but eventually halted by a court action.Joyce returned to Trieste in 1919, then moved to Paris, where, in 1922, ""Ulysses"" was published by Sylvia Beach, owner of a celebrated bookshop. Its portrait of Dublin, and of the Jewish advertisement canvasser Leopold Bloom, revolutionised the novel with its 'stream of consciousness' technique; it was not published in Britain until 1936. In 1923, Joyce began the almost impenetrable ""Finnegans Wake"", which was published in 1939. Joyce and Nora finally married in 1931. In 1940, the couple returned to Zurich, where he died on 13 January 1941, aged 58."
Louis_Ferdinand_Celine,"Louis-Ferdinand C√©line was born on 27 May 1894 in Courbevoie, Seine [now Hauts-de-Seine], France. He was a writer and actor, known for Die Nacht (1985), Contes modernes (1979) and Par coeur (1998). He was married to Lucette Almanzor and Edith Follet. He died on 1 July 1961 in Meudon, Seine-et-Oise [now Hauts-de-Seine], France."
Boris_Pasternak,"Boris Pasternak was born in Moscow on February 10, 1890 into an
artistic family of Russian-Jewish heritage. His father was an acclaimed
artist named Leonid Pasternak, who converted to Christianity, and his
mother was a renown concert pianist named Rosa Kaufman. Their home was
open to family friends such as composers Sergei Rachmaninoff and Aleksandr Skryabin as well as
writers Rilke and Lev Tolstoy. Pasternak had a happy childhood, being
brought up by prominent intellectuals in a cosmopolitan atmosphere. He
studied music at the Moscow Conservatory and philosophy at the
University of Marburg, Germany. In 1914 he returned to Moscow and
published his first collection of poems. His work at a chemical factory
in the Urals during WWI was later used as material for his novel
""Doctor Zhivago"".In 1917 he fell in love with a Jewish girl and wrote ""My Sister Life"",
a collection of passionate metaphoric poems that brought him
international recognition and had an impact upon Russian Symbolist and
Futurist poetry. Pasternak cautiously supported the Russian revolution,
but was shocked with the brutality of communists. His parents and
sisters emigrated to Europe in 1921. During the ""Great Terror"" of
1930s, Pasternak became disillusioned with the Soviet reality. He came
under severe political attack and devoted himself to making
translations of classic works: Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"", ""Macbeth"", ""King
Lear"", Goethe's ""Faust"", as well as Paul Verlaine, Rainer Maria Rilke
and other Western poets. His translations of Georgian poets favored by
Joseph Stalin probably saved his life. Stalin spoke with Pasternak in 1934
over the phone, and questioned his association with poet Osip
Mandelstam, who was executed upon Stalin's order. Later Stalin crossed
Pasternak's name off the arrest list, quoted as saying ""Don't touch
this cloud dweller"", alluding to his book ""The Twin in the Clouds"".During 1940s-50s Pasternak wrote his autobiographic novel ""Doctor
Zhivago"". A model for Lara in the novel was the poet's muse, beautiful
and kind Olga Iwinskaja, an editor at ""Novy Mir"" magazine. In 1949, when she
was pregnant by Pasternak, she was arrested by KGB on false accusations
of ""spying"" and spent 4 years in prison-camp. Their unborn baby was
lost, and Pasternak suffered a heart attack. After the death of Joseph
Stalin in 1953, Olga Iwinskaja was released and reunited with
Pasternak, who completed ""Doctor Zhivago"". He tried to publish it in
the Soviet magazine ""Novy Mir"", but was rejected. The manuscript of
""Doctor Zhivago"" was secretly smuggled out of the Soviet Union and was
first published in Italy in 1957.Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1958. But
Soviet authorities declared him a ""traitor"" and attacked him with a
campaign of persecution, terrorizing Pasternak up until his death in
1960. He was so abused by the Soviet authorities, that he became unable
to go to accept the Nobel Prize and was forced to decline the honor. He
lived the life of fear and insecurity that was imposed upon him and
millions of others under the Soviet totalitarian system. He ended his
life in poverty and a virtual exile in an artist's community of
Peredelkino near Moscow. His last poems are devoted to love, to
freedom, and to reconciliation with God. Pasternak was rehabilitated
posthumously in 1987. In 1988, after being banned in the Soviet Union
for three decades, ""Doctor Zhivago"" was published in the same ""Novy
Mir"" magazine as a sign of changing times. In 1989 Pasternak's son
accepted his father's Nobel Prize medal in Stockholm."
Federico_Garcia_Lorca,"Feder√≠co Garcia Lorca was born in the south of Spain (Andalusia) in
1898 and soon became the region's most famous artist. A poet,
playwright, artist, musician and lecturer, he wrote groundbreaking
plays such as 'Blood Wedding' and 'Yerma'. His support of the Spanish
Republic in the 1930s led to his execution in 1936."
Pablo_Neruda,"Pablo Neruda was the pseudonym of Chilean poet Ricardo Neftali Reyes
Basualto. He was born in Parral, a little town in central Chile, but
his family moved to Temuco City when he was just a few months old. It
was there he showed interest in poetry and made his early works, and
where he picked ""Pablo Neruda"" as a pseudonym because his father did
not approve of his writing.Neruda He is considered one of the greatest Spanish-language poets of
the 20th century. He is called ""The Poet of Love"" because his poetry is
sensual and sometimes very erotic. He was the honorary Chilean consul
in Burma, Ceylon, Java, Singapore, Buenos Aires, Barcelona and Madrid.
In 1943 he returned to Chile but left in 1949 because Chilean President
Gabriel Gonzalez Videla was after him for political reasons. From
1949-52 he lived in exile in different European countries. He was also
known as an outspoken Communist. he died in Santiago, Chile, a few days

Nikolay_Gogol,"Nikolai (Mykola) Gogol was a Russian humorist, dramatist, and novelist of Ukrainian origin.
His ancestors were bearing the name of Gogol-Janovsky and claimed
belonging to the upper class Polish Szlachta. Gogol's father, a
Ukrainian writer living on his old family estate, had five other
children. He died when the Gogol was 15. Young Gogol was fond of the
drama class at his high school in Nezhin, Ukraine. He was strongly
influenced by his religious mother, as well as by the enchanting beauty
of the Ukrainian folklore. He also called himself a ""free Cossac"".At age 18 Gogol moved to St. Petersburg, became a student, and later a
professor of history at the St. Petersburg University. His short
stories, set in St. Petersburg, became a success. His play ""Revizor""
(1836, The Inspector General) had its premiere in St. Petersburg
attended by the Tzar Nickolai I. But it also made him many powerful
enemies who hated his satire on the corrupt Russian society. It was his
friend Alexander Pushkin who suggested to him the subject for ""Revizor"". Pushkin
also suggested the main idea of ""The Dead Souls"" (1842), a bitter
satirical story of a crook, who was buying the names of dead surfs from
various greedy landlords, for a tax-evasion scheme. In his other famous
story ""Shinel"" (1842, The Overcoat) a poor clerk is intimidated both by
thieves and by the government. Gogol's discontent against the slavery
and social injustices in Russia caused him trouble. He escaped to
Europe for 12 years, returning to Russia briefly to publish the 1st
part of ""The Dead Souls"".His religious beliefs were used by the State-controlled Orthodox Church
to place guilt on him and to cause interruption of his literary work.
In 1848 he made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. After his return to Russia,
he settled in Moscow, where he fell under the control of the fanatical
Orthodox priest, Konstantinovskii, who demanded that Gogol quit writing
and destroy the manuscript of the 2nd part of ""The Dead Souls"". Torn by
his inner conflict with guilt and being under the pressure from the
fanatical priest, Gogol burned his manuscript. He died nine days later
in pain without having any food during his last days. In the 1931
excavation of his tomb, his body was found lying face down, which
caused suspicion that Gogol was buried alive.His style involves the elements of the fantastic and grotesque, with
the taste for the macabre and absurd, following the tradition of
E.T.A. Hoffmann. Fyodor Dostoevsky proclaimed, ""We all came out from under his Overcoat"",
referring to Gogol's influence on Russian writers. Sometimes compared
with Franz Kafka, Gogol had such followers, as Yevgeni Zamyatin, Vladimir Nabokov, and
Mikhail A. Bulgakov."
Honore_De_Balzac,"Honor√© de Balzac was a French writer whose works have been made into films, such as, –ö—É–∑–∏–Ω–∞ –ë–µ—Ç—Ç–∞ (1998) starring Jessica Lange, and television serials, such as Cousin Bette (1971), starring Margaret Tyzack and Helen Mirren.He was born on March 20, 1799, in Tours, France. His father, Bernard Francois Balzac, was a government regional administrator who married a daughter of his boss. The family moved to Paris in 1815. There Balzac went to the Sorbonne, matriculated in jurisprudence and became a clerk for an attorney.Balzac's efforts at publishing his early novels under a pseudonym and in his own publishing company failed, and he went into debt. His activity as a journalist brought recognition among intellectuals for his political and cultural reviews, which resonated with the mixed social expectations during the Restoration. However, with the 1830 fall of the Bourbon monarchy came the new, ""bourgeous"" (or capitalist) monarchy, a chimera doomed to fall in the 1848 revolutions that swept Europe. Such was the political background for Balzac's literary works.Balzac created the idea of a serialized cross-genre web of stories and novels, linked together as a broad historic panorama of lives and events. This idea was implemented in his ""La Comedie humane"" (""The Human Comedy""). It included about 100 stories, novels and essays, some of them unfinished. Such a vast body of handwriting could not be possible without an obsession. His plans and plots grew constantly and often changed, just to include a new idea based on a fresh gossip. Altogether his works reflected on a mosaic of life in Paris, and France in general, from the 1820s to 1850.""Les Chouans"" (1829) was a prologue to the collection of Balsac's interconnected works, known as the Human Comedy; it really opened with ""Scenes de la Vie Privee"", six Scenes From a Private Life (1830-1832) and ""La Peau de chagrin"" (The Goat-skin 1831). Balzac was writing 14 to 18 hours a day and often through the night, constantly doping himself with countless cups of coffee. He draw upon ideas from the works of Walter Scott and William Shakespeare, as in 1835's ""Le pere Goriot"" (""Father Goriot""), a ""King Lear"" type of story set in 1820s Paris. He also created many of his own purely original plots and introduced over 2,000 characters through the books of the Human Comedy. The largest ""stones"" in his pyramid of fiction are ""Eugene Grande"" (1833), a thousand-page saga; ""Les Illusions Perdues"" (""Lost Illusions""); ""Le cousin Pons"" (1847), ""La Cousine Bette"" (1848). His novel ""Eugenia Grande"" was translated into Russian in 1844 by the young writer Fyodor Dostoevsky.One year before his death, being in declining health, Balzac traveled to Poland to see his pen-friend of 15 years, Countess Evelina Hanska. She was a wealthy lady of the Polish nobility. They married in Berdichev, Russian Empire, in 1850, when Balzac had only three months left to live. He died on August 18, 1850, in Paris, and was laid to rest in the cemetery of P√®re Lachaise."
Ernest_Hemingway,"Ernest Hemingway was an American writer who won the Pulitzer Prize
(1953) and the Nobel Prize in Literature (1954) for his novel The Old
Man and the Sea, which was made into a 1958 film
–°—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–∫ –∏ –º–æ—Ä–µ (1958).He was born into the hands of his physician father. He was the second
of six children of Dr. Clarence Hemingway and Grace Hemingway (the
daughter of English immigrants). His father's interests in history and
literature, as well as his outdoorsy hobbies (fishing and hunting),
became a lifestyle for Ernest. His mother was a domineering type who
wanted a daughter, not a son, and dressed Ernest as a girl and called
him Ernestine. She also had a habit of abusing his quiet father, who
suffered from diabetes, and Dr. Hemingway eventually committed suicide.
Ernest later described the community in his hometown as one having
""wide lawns and narrow minds"".In 1916 Hemingway graduated from high school and began his writing
career as a reporter for The Kansas City Star. There he adopted his
minimalist style by following the Star's style guide: ""Use short
sentences. Use short first paragraphs. Use vigorous English. Be
positive, not negative."" Six months later he joined the Ambulance Corps
in WWI and worked as an ambulance driver on the Italian front, picking
up human remains. In July 1918 he was seriously wounded by a mortar
shell, which left shrapnel in both of his legs causing him much pain
and requiring several surgeries. He was awarded the Silver Medal. Back
in America, he continued his writing career working for Toronto Star .
At that time he met Hadley Richardson and the two married in 1921.In 1921, he became a Toronto Star reporter in Paris. There he published
his first books, called ""Three Stories and Ten Poems"" (1923), and ""In
Our Time"" (1924). In Paris he met
Gertrude Stein, who introduced him to the
circle that she called the ""Lost Generation"".
F. Scott Fitzgerald,
Thornton Wilder,
Sherwood Anderson and
Ezra Pound were stimulating Hemingway's
talent. At that time he wrote ""The Sun Also Rises"" (1926), ""A Farewell
to Arms"" (1929), and a dazzling collection of Forty-Nine stories.
Hemingway also regarded the Russian writers
Lev Tolstoy,
Fyodor Dostoevsky,
Ivan Turgenev and
Anton Chekhov as important influences, and
met Pablo Picasso and other artists
through Gertrude Stein. ""A Moveable Feast"" (1964) is his classic memoir
of Paris after WWI.Hemingway participated in the Spanish Civil War and took part in the
D-Day landings during the invasion of France during World War II, in
which he not only reported the action but took part in it. In one
instance he threw three hand grenades into a bunker, killing several SS
officers. He was decorated with the Bronze Star for his action. His
military experiences were emulated in ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" (1940)
and in several other stories. He settled near Havana, Cuba, where he
wrote his best known work, ""The Old Man and the Sea"" (1953), for which
he won a Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize in Literature. This was
adapted as the film
–°—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–∫ –∏ –º–æ—Ä–µ (1958),
for which Spencer Tracy was
nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actor, and
Dimitri Tiomkin received an Oscar for
Best Musical Score.War wounds, two plane crashes, four marriages and several affairs took
their toll on Hemingway's hereditary predispositions and contributed to
his declining health. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and
insomnia in his later years. His mental condition was exacerbated by
chronic alcoholism, diabetes and liver failure. After an unsuccessful
treatment with electro-convulsive therapy, he suffered severe amnesia
and his physical condition worsened. The memory loss obstructed his
writing and everyday life. He committed suicide in 1961. Posthumous
publications revealed a considerable body of his hidden writings, that
was edited by his fourth wife, Mary, and also by his son Patrick
Hemingway."

Racine was primarily a tragedian, producing such ""examples of neoclassical perfection"" as Ph√®dre, Andromaque, and Athalie. He did write one comedy, Les Plaideurs, and a muted tragedy, Esther for the young."
Albert_Camus,"Albert Camus was born on November 7, 1913, in Mondovi, Algeria. His
parents were Spanish-French-Algerian (pied noir) colonists. His father,
Lucien, died in the Battle of Marne (1914) during WWI. His
mother, named Catherine Helene Sintes was of Spanish origin, she was a
deaf mute due to a stroke, but she was able to read lips and worked as
a cleaning lady, providing for her son, who loved her to tears.Camus studied at Algiers Lycee from 1923-32, then at the University of
Algiers, from where he graduated in 1936 with a degree in philosophy.
While a student he joined the French Communist Party in 1934, but in
1936 he joined the 'Le Parti du Peuple Algerien' and was denounced by
communists as 'Trotskyite'. He was seriously influenced by the writings
of 'Andre Malraux', 'Andre Gide' and Plotinus' theory of the ""One"", which became
Camus' graduation thesis (1936).He was rejected from the French army because of tuberculosis, which he
contracted in the 1930's. His first marriage to Simone Hie, a morphine
addict, ended due to infidelity from both of them. In 1940 Camus
married a pianist and mathematician Francine Faure, whom he loved and
patiently tolerated her affair with the actress Mar√≠a Casares. Camus and
Francine Faure had twins born in 1945.During the Second World War Camus was a writer for 'Paris-Soir'
magazine. He was in Paris during the Wermacht occupation, and witnessed
the execution of the French communist and anti-fascist activist Gabriel
Peri by firearm, which turned Camus' mind against Nazi
Germany. He moved to Bordeaux, where he finished his early works, 'The
Stranger' and 'The Myth of Sisyphus', which opens with his famous
statement about the philosophical question of suicide, and deals with
the absurdity of existence in the meaningless struggle.Camus joined the French Resistance cell 'Combat' and edited the
eponymous paper under the pseudonym 'Beauchard'. He reported on the
fighting when Allies liberated Paris in 1944. Camus continued his work
for 'Combat' until 1947, and through this work he became acquainted
with Jean-Paul Sartre. For a couple of years Camus was a member of Sartre's
circle at the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard St. Germain, but Camus'
criticism of communist doctrine soon alienated Sartre. He highly regarded
Franz Kafka and William Faulkner, whose 'Requiem for a Nun' he adopted into a play.Camus' lectures about French existentialism brought him on a 3-month
tour of the United States and Canada in 1946, where he spoke at several
universities. He lectured for 3 months in Brazil, Argentina and Chile
in 1949, where he became sick and almost suicidal. The return of his
tuberculosis forced Camus into seclusion from 1949-1951. It was during
those 2 years that he crystallized his analysis of rebels and
revolutions and published 'The Rebel'. The book clearly formulates his
rejection of communism as well as any violent activity under various
Utopian masks of 'social justice'.Albert Camus' desire for clarity and meaning in the world that offers
nothing, but chaos, resulted in his work on the idea of absurdism. It
was incorporated in many of his works from 'The Myth of Sisyphus'
(1942), 'The Plaque' (1947), 'The Rebel' (1951), and other works.
Camus' ideas resulted from his philosophic analysis of the diverse list
of sources from 'Epicurus' to Fyodor Dostoevsky, Friedrich Nietzsche, and 'Andre Breton', as well as
his own experiences in the war and his studies.His greatest work 'The Fall' (1956) presents the monologues of a
self-proclaimed 'judge penitent' Clamence, whose character alludes to
Zarathustra from Friedrich Nietzsche and Grand Inquisitor from the 'Karamasov
Brothers' of Fyodor Dostoevsky. Camus challenges the reader with the dilemma of
accepting the absurdity of our existence and/or learning how to deal
with it as well as with the unpredictable consequences from doing something
about it.Camus was the proponent of the idea of human rights. He resigned from
UNESCO in 1952 in protest of the UN acceptance of Spain under 'Edgar
Franco 'El General''. He protested against the Soviet crush upon
the East Berlin workers in 1953, and against the Soviet repressions in
Hungary in 1956. He was a steady supporter of pacifism and was in
opposition to capital punishment. In 1957 Camus was awarded the Nobel
Prize in Literature.He was killed in a car accident on January 4, 1960, in the small town
of Villeblevin, France, in the car driven by his publisher and close
friend Michel Gallimard, who also died in the accident."
Jean_Paul_Sartre,"Jean-Paul Charles-Aymard Sartre was born on June 21, 1905, in Paris,
France. His father, Jean-Baptiste Sartre, was an officer in the French
Navy. His mother, Anne-Marie Schweitzer, was the cousin of Nobel Prize
laureate Dr. Albert Schweitzer. Sartre was one year old when his father died. He
was raised in Meudon, at the home of his tough grandfather Charles
Schweitzer, a high school professor. His early education included
music, mathematic, and classical literature. He studied at the Lycee
Montaigne and at Lycee Henri IV in Paris. In 1917 his mother married an
engineer at the naval yards in La Rochelle. There young Sartre suffered
under his controlling stepfather, whom he called an ""intruder"". Such
experiences shaped his character to rebel against any restrictions and
domination.The happiest part of his childhood was when Sartre met Paul Nizan, who was
his classmate at the Lycee Henri IV in Paris. They became constant
companions and best friends. Sartre continued his studies in Paris at
Lycee Louis-Le-Grand, then at Ecole Normale Superieure and Sorbonne.
There Sartre advanced in his studies of philosophy, absorbing mainly
from the ""Gifford Lectures"" by Henri Bergson and ""The Principles of
Psychology"" by Harvard philosopher William James, as well as from
Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Nietzsche, Edmund Husserl, S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Hegel,
Karl Marx and Martin Heidegger.Sartre saw the artificiality of grown-ups in the bourgeois class as the
outcome of their spiritually destructive conformity. His Sorbonne
classmate and girlfriend Simone de Beauvoir was also an unrestricted thinker and
later one of the founders of contemporary feminism. Both learned to
hate the restrictions of upper-class life. Both favored an ""authentic
state of being"". In 1932 Sartre proposed to Beauvoir, but she turned
him down and went on teaching alone. In 1935 she introduced Sartre to
her 18-year-old student Olga Kozakiewich and the three formed the
""family"". Sartre was used by Beauvoir, who merged both relationships
into a trio, that led to an unexpected and overwhelming outcome. While
they imagined the trio would illustrate the 'authenticity' of their
relationships; in reality the inevitable competition from the younger
and independent-minded Olga became a growing threat. Beauvoir saw Olga
as an object, a mere cast member of the game. She also overestimated
her own tolerance. Eventually the trio failed before the challenge to
reciprocate in recognition of each one's ""authentic"" consciousness.
Each member wrote a different account of the same events in their
""family"" life. In Sartre's trilogy ""Les chemins de la liberte"" (The
Roads to Freedom 1945-1949) Olga is disguised as the character of
Ivich.Sartre and de Beauvoir continued experimenting with their ""open family""
by including several former students of both Beauvoir and Sartre,
forming a unique social group with Olga Kazakiewich, Nathalie Sorokine
and Jacques-Laurent Bost. The complex manner of relationships in the
""family"" was somewhat based on the intellectual connection between
students and teachers, who also shared cooking and other domestic
duties. Other family members' ""authentic"" consciousness added to social
inventiveness and developed a sort of a survival group-therapy during
the occupation of Paris in WWII. ""Existence precedes transformation of
consciousness"" - commented Sartre.In 1938 he wrote ""La Nausee"" (Nausea), which became the canonical work
of existentialism. It was partially influenced by Franz Kafka and Edmund
Husserl, reiterating the belief that human life has no purpose. The
book is set in a French town where Antoine, a 30-year-old historian, is
doing his research on an 18th-century politician. He is gradually
overtaken by a sickness he calls nausea. This alters his senses,
thoughts and emotional experiences of the past and present in an
uncommon way. Antoine is anxiously searching for the lost meaning of
things, people and events. The character of Antoine embodies Sartre's
theories of existential angst, and his own search through the chaos of
things and events; that are crowding the human life.Sartre was initially torn between his pacifism and his anti-Nazi
position. In 1939 he was drafted into the French army and assigned to
the 70th Division in Nancy, then transferred to Morsbonn military camp.
There he started writing his ""L'etre et neant"". He was captured by the
Germans and imprisoned from 1940-1941. While in prison he reread
Martin Heidegger and wrote the play ""Bariona"". In March of 1941 he escaped from
the Nazi POW camp. He and Beauvoir traveled to the south of France
where they wooed Andr√© Gide and Andr√© Malraux to their underground group,
""Socialisme et Liberte"". Their active resistance was soon tamed into
mere writing for ""Combat"", published by Albert Camus. Sartre became a
teacher in Lycee Condorcet from 1941-1944 and supported the ""family"" of
five during the occupation of Paris. At that time his opus magnum
""L'etre et neant"" (Being and Nothingness, 1943) was completed and
published. He also wrote a play, ""No Exit"", as an attempt ""to repeat
'Being and Nothingness' in different words"". It premiered in May of
1944. In 1945 Sartre with his intellectual friends co-founded ""Les
Tempes Modernes"", a leftist journal named after Charles Chaplin's film –ù–æ–≤—ã–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∞ (1936).
Sartre published Beauvoir's works first, giving her a steady platform
and publicity. In 1945 he published ""L'age de raison"" (The Age of
Reason), beginning the trilogy of ""The Roads to Freedom"".His ""Reflexions sur la question juive"" (Reflections on the Jewish
Question) was written after the liberation of Paris from the Nazi
occupation in 1944. The first part (The Portrait of the Anti-Semite)
was published in December of 1945 in Les Temps Modernes. Sartre deals
with anti-Semitism and reaction to it on all levels. In 1962 Sartre
adopted a Jewish musician, Arlette El Kaim, and later took his adopted
daughter along on his visit to Israel, where he accepted an honorary
doctorate from Hebrew University in 1976. Through his life Sartre
expressed his interest in Messianic Judaism. A few months before his
death he began a study of Jewish history. In his last interview with
his friend and associate Benny Levy, Sartre said that ""the messianic
idea is the base of the revolutionary idea"", but violent revolution is
not the way.In 1950 Sartre denounced Soviet labor camps, known as gulag prison
camps. In 1955 he and Beauvoir went on official visits to the Soviet
Union and to communist China. As left-leaning academics they accepted
the official invitations from the communist governments. Sartre and
Beauvoir met with Nikita Khrushchev. Beauvoir was commissioned by the Communist
governments to write positively about communism and the 1917
revolution. Beauvoir took their money and published her shameful book,
for which she and Sartre were ostracized in the West. In 1960 the two
visited Cuba on the invitation of Fidel Castro. ""Every man is a political
animal,"" stated Sartre when he started as an editor of La Liberacion.Sartre came to disaffection with the bourgeois lifestyle, as one of the
perpetual ceremony that can strip people from their identity. For a
similar reason he saw religion as a prison, although he was baptized
Catholic. He lived a very modest life in a small apartment which he
shared with Beauvoir on Rue Bonaparte in Montparnasse. There were
attacks on his home in 1961, most likely by right-wing elements
outraged by his position on Algerian independence (he was for it).
Sartre spoke out on behalf of the Hungarians in 1956 and on behalf of
the Czechs in 1968. He presided over the International War Crimes
Tribunal set up by Bertrand Russell in 1967. He turned down prizes and took no
money for any of his political positions; unlike his partner Beauvoir.
Such independence made his voice more credible.Jean-Paul Sartre quit writing literature after decades of success and
misunderstanding. Ambiguity of his ideas and political evolution only
reflected an effort to keep up with the rapidly changing times. His
existentialism became a philosophy of the beatniks. His works were
prohibited by the Catholic ""index"". ""If God does not exist, everything
is permitted"", quoted Sartre from Fyodor Dostoevsky. He finally renounced
literature as a ""machine for producing words"", and refused to accept
the Nobel Prize for Literature, which he was awarded in 1964. He
exhausted himself during the work on ""Critique de la raison
dialectique"" (Critique of Dialectical Reason, 1960), the work he wanted
to be remembered for. He left the unfinished massive biography of
Gustave Flaubert, and over 300 personal letters to Beauvoir, who published them
all after his death.Sartre underwent his transformation from being a disciple of Andre Gide
to a complete break-away. In his many incarnations--the philosopher,
novelist, playwright, journalist, song lyricist, magazine editor,
political activist--Sartre moved ahead by breaking old rules. He even
used hard psychotropic drugs to ""break the bones in his head"" and think
big. Sartre's opposition to the rigid social organization and
self-destructive nature of class society and inevitable fatality of the
modern world was paralleled by that of Aldous Huxley.Jean-Paul Sartre exhausted himself with overwork, stress, drugs and
alcohol. He died of edema of the lungs on April 15, 1980. His funeral
was attended by 50,000 people, when he was laid to rest in the
Cimetiere du Montparnasse in Paris, France. Six years later Beauvoir,
who refused his marriage proposal in their youth, joined him in his
grave forever."
Chingiz_Aitmatov,"Chingiz Aitmatov was a Russian-Kyrgyz writer and statesman known for

Kyrgyz Agricultural Institute in Frunze, but changed from the study of
livestock to the study of literature at the Gorky Literature Institute
in Moscow.He made his literary debut in Russia, in 1952, with publication of his
stories in Russian. From 1958 to 1966 he was roving correspondent for
the leading Soviet Newspaper Pravda. In 1967 he became a member of the
Executive Board of the Soviet Writers Union, and in 1968 he won the
Soviet State Prize for literature for his novel Farewell, Gulsary!, a

'Farewell, Gyulsary!' (1967), 'The White Ship' (1972), and 'The Day
Lasts More Than a Hundred Years' (1988) were translated in more than 20
languages across the world. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991, Aitmatov's novels found a new audience in the West and gained
popularity in Germany. He died of pneumonia and kidney failure on June
10, 2008, in Nuremberg, Germany, and was laid to rest in Kyrgyzstan."

Milan_Kundera,"Milan Kundera was born on April 1st 1929 in Brno, Czechoslovakia. He
wrote his first poems during his high school years. After World War II
he worked as a jazz musician before going to college. He studied music,
film and literature at university in Prague. He moved on to become a

He also published poems, essays and stage plays. In the same period of
time he joined the editorial staff at the literature magazines
""Literarni noviny"" and ""Listy"". Kundera joined the Communist Party in
1948, as many other Czech intellectuals did at that time. In 1950 he
got expelled from the Party because of ""individualistic tendencies"".After graduation in 1952 he was appointed lecturer in world literature
at the Film Academy. He joined the Communist Party once again and
stayed on from 1956 to 1970. In 1953 he published his first book of

Jules_Verne,"Jules Gabriel Verne (1828-1905) was one of the most famous French novelists of all time. His major work is the ""Extraordinary Journeys"", a series of more than sixty adventure novels including ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"", ""Around the World in 80 Days"", ""20.000 Leagues under the Seas"" and ""The Mysterious Island"" which had multiple cinematographic adaptations. Nicknamed ""The father of science fiction"", he is the second most translated author in the world after Agatha Christie."
Mark_Twain,"Mark Twain, born Samuel Langhorne Clemens in Florida, Missouri in 1835,

cry used on his steamboat - ""by the mark, twain""."
Francois_Rabelais,"Fran√ßois Rabelais was a French Renaissance writer, physician, Renaissance humanist, monk and Greek scholar. He is primarily known as a writer of satire, of the grotesque, and of bawdy jokes and songs.Ecclesiastical and anticlerical, Christian and considered by some as a free thinker, a doctor and having the image of a ""Bon Vivant"", the multiple facets of his personality sometimes seem contradictory. Caught up in the religious and political turmoil of the Reformation, Rabelais showed himself to be both sensitive and critical towards the great questions of his time. Subsequently, the views of his life and work have evolved according to the times and currents of thought."
George_Bernard_Shaw,"The Anglo-Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950), winner of
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1925, acquired a reputation as the
greatest dramatist in the English language during the first half of the
20th Century for the plays he had written at the height of his
creativity from ""Mrs. Warren's Profession"" in 1893 to ""The Apple Cart""
in 1929. His works have been revived on Broadway from 1894 to 2010. His
most famous work in the 21st Century is
–ú–æ—è –ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–∞—è –ª–µ–¥–∏ (1964), the musical
adaptation of –ü–∏–≥–º–∞–ª–∏–æ–Ω (1938).A Shavian drama (his reputation was so great, he had his own adjective
ascribed to his works) had a biting social critique leavened by humor.
According to his Nobel Prize citation, ""His ideas were those of a
somewhat abstract logical radicalism; hence they were far from new, but
they received from him a new definiteness and brilliance. In him these
ideas combined with a ready wit, a complete absence of respect for any
kind of convention, and the merriest humor - all gathered together in
an extravagance which has scarcely ever before appeared in literature.""He was a major international celebrity and a force in British politics,
being a charter member of the Fabian Society. The Fabians were
committed to democratic socialism, that is, using parliamentary
mechanisms to encourage a gradual adoption of socialist policies
through political reform rather than revolution."
Arthur_Conan_Doyle,"Arthur Conan Doyle was a British writer of Irish descent, considered a major figure in crime fiction. His most famous series of works consisted of the ""Sherlock Holmes"" stories (1887-1927), consisting of four novels and 56 short stories. His other notable series were the ""Professor Challenger"" stories (1912-1929) about a scientist and explorer, and the ""Brigadier Gerard"" stories (1894-1910) about a French soldier in the Napoleonic Wars. Doyle's literary works have frequently been adapted into film and television.In 1859, Doyle was born in Edinburgh, Scotland to an Irish Catholic family. His father was Charles Altamont Doyle (1832 - 1893), a professional illustrator and water-colorist who is primarily remembered for fantasy-style paintings. Doyle's mother was Mary Foley (1837-1920). Through his father, Doyle was a nephew of the antiquarian James William Edmund Doyle (1822 - 1892), the illustrator Richard Doyle (1824-1883), and the gallery director Henry Edward Doyle (1827 -1893). Doyle's paternal grandfather was the political cartoonist and caricaturist John Doyle (1797-1868).During his early years, Doyle's family had financial problems due to his father's struggles with depression and alcoholism. They received financial support from affluent uncles, who also financed Doyle's education. From 1868 to 1870, Doyle was educated at Hodder Place, a Jesuit preparatory school located at Stonyhurst, Lancashire. From 1870 to 1875, Doyle attended Stonyhurst College, a Roman Catholic boarding school. He disliked the school due to its rather limited curriculum, and the constant threats of corporal punishment and ritual humiliation used to discipline students.From 1875 to 1876, Doyle received further education at Stella Matutina, a Jesuit school located at Feldkirch, Austria. His family wanted him to perfect his use of the German language, but this school offered a wider range of study subjects. Stella Matutina attracted student from many countries, and was more cosmopolitan in nature than Doyle's previous schools.Doyle decided to follow a medical career. From 1876 to 1881, Doyle studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. He also took botany lessons at the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. During his university years, Doyle started writing short stories. He had trouble finding a publisher, and ""Blackwood's Magazine"" (1817-1980) rejected his submitted work. Doyle's first published short story was ""The Mystery of Sasassa Valley"" (1879), featuring a demon in South Africa. That same year, Doyle published his first academic article in a science journal. The article examined the uses of the flowering plant Gelsemium as a poison. As an experiment, Doyle self-administrated doses of the poison and recorded the symptoms.In 1880, Doyle worked for a while as a doctor in the whaling ship ""Hope"". In 1881, following his graduation from medical school, Doyle served as a ship's surgeon on the SS Mayumba. In 1882, Doyle and a former classmate established a medical practice in Plymouth, Devon. Their partnership failed, and Doyle soon started his own practice in Southsea, Hampshire. He did not have many patients, so he decided to resume writing fiction to supplement his income.In 1886, Doyle created the character of Sherlock Holmes. He loosely based his creation on his former college teacher Joseph Bell (1837 - 1911), inspired by Bell's emphasis on the importance of ""deduction and inference and observation"". Doyle completed the first Holmes novel, ""A Study in Scarlet"" (1887), and sold the rights to the publishing house ""Ward, Lock & Co."" (1854-1964). The novel's publication was delayed until November, 1887, but it was well-received by professional critics.Doyle next completed the sequel novel ""The Sign of the Four"" (1890), commissioned from the American literary magazine Lippincott's Monthly Magazine (1868-1915). He started writing short stories about Holmes for the British literary magazine ""The Strand Magazine"" (1891-1950).Besides Holmes stories, Doyle wrote seven historical novels between 1888 and 1906. He wrote ""Micah Clarke"" (1889), as a fictionalized account of the Monmouth Rebellion (1685) and its consequences. The novel also voices Doyle's arguments against religious extremism. He wrote ""The White Company"" (1891) to examine the role of mercenaries in 14th-century warfare, depicting the campaigns of Edward the Black Prince (1330-1376) in the Kingdom of Castile. He wrote ""The Great Shadow"" (1892) to feature the experiences of soldiers in the Battle of Waterloo (1815). He wrote ""The Refugees"" (1893) to examine the fates of Huguenot refugees who were fleeing 17th-century France to escape religious persecution by Louis XIV (1638-1715, reigned 1643-1715). He wrote ""Sir Nigel"" (1906) to examine the early phases of the Hundred Years' War (1337 - 1453). He regarded these novels to be his best literary work, though they were never as popular as his crime novels.In 1900, Doyle served as a volunteer doctor in the Second Boer War in South Africa (1899-1902), though he had no previous military experience. He was stationed at a field hospital at Bloemfontein. At about this time, Doyle wrote the non-fiction book ""The Great Boer War"" (1900), which covered in detail the early phases of the war. He also wrote the companion work ""The War in South Africa: Its Cause and Conduct"" in order to defend the British Empire from accusations of misconduct in its military efforts. These works were translated in multiple languages, and were appreciated by the British government. For his services to the British Empire, Doyle was knighted in 1902. In 1903, Doyle became a knight of the Order of Saint John, a British royal order of chivalry that was based on the original Knights Hospitaller.In 1906, Doyle was involved in efforts to exonerate the lawyer George Edalji, a mild-mannered man who had been convicted of animal mutilations on insufficient evidence. Doyle helped publicize other instances of miscarriages of justice, and convinced the public that there was need of reforms in the legal system. In 1907, British authorities reacted to this campaign by establishing the Court of Criminal Appeal.In 1909, Doyle wrote the non-fiction work ""The Crime of the Congo"" (1909). In the book, Doyle denounced the human rights abuses in the Congo Free State, and claimed that the Belgian colonial forces had enslaved the local population. He quoted testimonies from many witnesses and tried to convince the public of a need to intervene in the area.World War I (1914-1918) was a difficult time for Doyle , as several of his relatives and friends died due to the war. Doyle's son Kingsley was seriously wounded in the Battle of the Somme (1916), and never fully recovered. Kingsley died of pneumonia in 1918, while still hospitalized. Doyle's brother, Brigadier-general Innes Doyle, died of pneumonia in 1919. Doyle's brother-in-law, the famous author E. W. Hornung, died of pneumonia in 1921. The series of deaths led Doyle to further embrace Spiritualism, and that faith's claims about existence beyond the grave. He spend much of the 1920s as a missionary of Spiritualism, and investigated supposed supernatural phenomena. He also wrote many non-fiction spiritualist works. In 1926, Doyle financed the construction of a Spiritualist Temple in Camden, London.In July 1930, Doyle suffered a heart attack while staying in his then-residence, Windlesham Manor, in Crowborough, Sussex. He spend his last moments in reassuring his wife Jean Leckie that she was wonderful. He was 71-years-old at the time of his death. He was survived by two sons and two daughters. His daughter Jean Conan Doyle (1912 - 1997) was the copyright holder of much of her father's works until her own death.Since Doyle was no longer a Christian at the time of his death, his family declined giving him a Christian burial place. Doyle was buried in Windlesham Manor's rose garden. His remains were later re-interred in Minstead churchyard, New Forest, Hampshire. His wife's remains were buried beside him. His gravestone epitaph described him as ""Steel true/Blade straight/Arthur Conan Doyle/Knight/Patriot, Physician and man of letters"".Doyle is long gone, but his works have remained popular into the 21st century. Doyle has been cited as an influence on later crime writers, and Agatha Christie's earliest novels were strongly influenced by Sherlock Holmes' stories. His life's events have inspired several biographies, and a number of fictionalized accounts."
Jane_Austen,"Jane Austen was born on December 16th, 1775, to the local rector, Rev.
George Austen (1731-1805), and Cassandra Leigh (1739-1827). She was the
seventh of eight children. She had one older sister, Cassandra. In 1783
she went to Southampton to be taught by a relative, Mrs. Cawley, but
was brought home due to a local outbreak of disease. Two years later
she attended the Abbey Boarding School in Reading, reportedly wanting
to follow her sister Cassandra, until 1786.Jane was mostly educated at home, where she learned how to play the
piano, draw and write creatively. She read frequently and later came to
enjoy social events such as parties, dances and balls. She disliked the
busy life of towns and preferred the country life, where she took to
taking long walks.In 1801 Jane, her parents and sister moved to Bath, a year after her
father's retirement, and the family frequented the coast. While on one
of those coastal holidays she met a young man, but the resulting
romantic involvement ended tragically when he died. It is believed by
many astute Austen fans that her novel, ""Persuasion"", was inspired by
this incident.Following her father's passing in January of 1805--which left his widow
and daughters with financial problems--the family moved several times
until finally settling into a small house, in Chawton, Hampshire, owned
by her brother Edward, which is reminiscent of ""Sense and Sensibility"".
It was in this house that she wrote most of her works.In March of 1817 her health began to decline and she was forced to
abandon her work on ""Sanditon"", which she never completed. It turned
out that she had Addisons disease. In April she wrote out her will and
then on May 24th moved with Cassandra to Winchester, to be near her
physician. It was in Winchester she died, in the arms of her sister, on
Friday, 18 July 1817, at the age of only 41. She was buried the 24th of
July at Winchester Cathedral. Jane never married.During her formative years, Jane wrote plays and poems. At 14 she wrote
her first novel, ""Love and Freindship [sic]"" and other juvenilia. Her
first (unsuccessful) submission to a publisher, however, was in 1797
titled ""First Impressions"" (later ""Pride and Prejudice""). In 1803
""Susan"" (later ""Northanger Abbey"") was actually sold to a publisher for
a mere ¬£10 but was not published until 14 years later, posthumously.
Her first accepted work was in 1811 titled ""Sense and Sensibility"",
which was published anonymously as were all books published during her
lifetime. She revised ""First Impressions"" and published it entitled
""Pride and Prejudice"" in 1813. ""Mansfield Park"" was published in 1814,
followed by ""Emma"" in 1816, the same year she completed ""Persuasion""
and began ""Sanditon"", which was ultimately left unfinished. Both
""Persuasion"" and ""Northanger Abbey"" were published in 1818, after her
death."
Geoffrey_Chaucer,"Geoffrey Chaucer was born in 1343 in London, Kingdom of England [now UK]. He was a writer. He was married to Philippa Roet. He died on 25 October 1400 in London, Kingdom of England [now UK]."
Antoine_De_Saint_Exupery,"Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry was born into a family of old provincial
nobility. Failing his final exams at a preparatory school, he
entered the √âcole des Beaux-Arts to study architecture. In 1921, he
began military service in the 2nd Regiment of Chasseurs, and
sent to Strasbourg for pilot training. The next year, he obtained
his license, and was offered a transfer to the air force. But his
fianc√©e's family objected, so he settled in Paris and took an office
job. His engagement ultimately broke off, and he worked at
several jobs over the next few years without success.By 1926, he was flying again. He became one of the pioneers of
international postal flight in the days when aircrafts had few
instruments and pilots flew by the seat of their pants. He worked on
the A√©ropostale between Toulouse and Dakar. His first tale, L'Aviateur
(The Aviator), was published in the magazine Le Navire d'Argent. In
1928, he published his first book, Courrier-Sud (Southern Mail), and
flew the Casablanca/Dakar route. He became the director of Cap Juby
airfield in Rio de Oro, Sahara. In 1929, he moved to South America
where he was appointed director of the Aeroposta Argentina Company. In
1931, Vol de Nuit (Night Flight), which won the Prix Femina, was
published. He married Salvadoran artist and writer Consuelo Suncin Sandoval de G√≥mez, who became the model for the temperamental Rose in Le Petit Prince. Theirs was a stormy union as Saint-Exup√©ry traveled frequently and indulged in numerous affairs.During World War II, he was in New York City, but returned to France to
join a squadron based in the Mediterranean. Now 44, he agreed to collect data on German troop movements in the Rhone River Valley. He took off the night of July 31, 1944, and was never seen again. A lady reported having seen a plane crash around noon on August 1st near the Bay of Carqueiranne. A body wearing a French uniform was found several days later, and buried. In 1998, a fisherman found a silver chain bracelet south of Marseille which was identified as being Saint-Exup√©ry's. On April 7, 2004, officials confirmed that the wreckage of a Lockheed Lightning P-38 found on the seabed off the coast of Marseille in 2000 was Saint-Exup√©ry's.Further research in 2006 by the dive team which recovered the wreckage located a German pilot who was flying a mission at the Bay of Carqueiranne at the time Saint-Exup√©ry's plane went down. Horst Rippert acknowledged that he shot at the plane, but did not report it, possibly because he was not sure he actually downed it. When the Germans heard American radio broadcasts that Saint-Exup√©ry was missing, Rippert said he knew that the plane he downed was his. Rippert idolized Saint-Exup√©ry, read all his books, and had been bothered by the incident his whole life. He told the dive team he would not have shot at the plane had he known it was Saint-Exup√©ry's."
Erich_Maria_Remarque,"The German novelist Erich Maria Remarque was born in Osnabr√ºck in 1898. His first novel, the famous anti-war epic –ù–∞ –∑–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–º —Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç–µ –±–µ–∑ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω (1930), was written based on his experiences as a soldier in WWI, and published in 1929. He moved to Switzerland until 1939 and later emigrated to the US. He died in 1970 in Locarno, Switzerland."
J_D_Salinger,"U.S. writer whose novel ""The Catcher in the Rye"" (1951) won critical
acclaim and devoted admirers, especially among the post-World War II
generation of college students. His entire corpus of published works
consists of that one novel and 13 short stories, all originally written
in the period 1948-59. Salinger was the son of a Jewish father and a mother who adopted Judaism, and, like Holden Caulfield, the hero of ""The Catcher
in the Rye"", he grew up in New York City, attending public schools and
a military academy. After brief periods at New York and Columbia
universities, he devoted himself entirely to writing, and his stories
began to appear in periodicals in 1940. After his return from service
in the U.S. Army (1942-46), Salinger's name and writing style became
increasingly associated with ""The New Yorker"" magazine, which published
almost all of his later stories. Some of the best of these made use of
his wartime experiences: ""For Esm√© - With Love and Squalor"" (1950)
describes a U.S. soldier's poignant encounter with two British
children; ""A Perfect Day for Bananafish"" (1948) concerns the suicide of
the sensitive, despairing veteran Seymour Glass. Major critical and
popular recognition came with the publication of ""The Catcher in the
Rye"", whose central character, a sensitive, rebellious adolescent,
relates in authentic teenage idiom his flight from the ""phony"" adult
world, his search for innocence and truth, and his final collapse on a
psychiatrist's couch. The humor and colorful language of ""The Catcher
in the Rye"" place it in the tradition of
Mark Twain's ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn""
and the stories of Ring Lardner, but its
hero, like most of Salinger's child characters, views his life with an
added dimension of precocious self-consciousness. ""Nine Stories""
(1953), a selection of Salinger's best work, added to his reputation.
The reclusive habits of Salinger,an obsessively private man especially
over the last half-century of his life, made his personal life a matter
of speculation among devotees, while his small literary output was a
subject of controversy among critics. ""Franny and Zooey"" (1961) brought
together two earlier New Yorker stories; both deal with the Glass
family, as do the two stories in ""Raise High the Roof Beam,
Carpenters""; and ""Seymour: An Introduction"" (1963)."
Virginia_Woolf,"London-born Virginia Woolf came from a wealthy family and, unlike her
brothers, received her education at home, an unusual step for the
times. Her parents had both had children from previous marriages, so
she grew up with a variety of siblings, stepbrothers and stepsisters.
Her father was a well-respected editor and author and the former
son-in-law of
William Makepeace Thackeray.
Author James Russell Lowell was her godfather, and
Henry James and
George Elliott were regular
visitors and guests at the family home. As she recalled later in life,
her most pleasant childhood memories were of the summers spent at the
family home in Cornwall, by Porthminster Bay (the Godrevy Lighthouse
there was the basis for her novel ""To the Lighthouse"").The sudden death of Virginia's mother in 1895, when she was 13, and the
passing of her sister two years later led to the first of Virginia's
mental breakdowns. In 1904 her father died, which caused a complete
mental and physical collapse and for a while she was sent to a mental
institution to recover. Nervous breakdowns and bouts of severe
depression tormented Virginia throughout her life, and the fact that as
children she and her sister Vanessa were sexually abused by two of
their stepbrothers added to her already considerable feelings of guilt
and inferiority.She studied at London's Kings College, where she became acquainted with
such literary figures as
Lytton Strachey, Saxon Sydney-Turner and
Leonard Woolf. She married Woolf in 1912.
Virginia was always ashamed of what she termed her ""unattractive
countenance"", and once wrote that ""being wanted [was] a pleasure that I
have never felt"". In 1922 she met
Vita Sackville-West, and the two
women began a relationship that lasted for almost ten years. She was
said to have written her novel ""Orlando"" as a love letter to West.After the publication of her novel ""Between the Acts"" she fell into a
deep depression, exacerbated by the destruction of her London home by
Nazi planes during the bombing of that city, and the less than
enthusiastic critical reaction to her biography of her close friend
Roger Fry. Her condition deteriorated to the point where she was unable
to write or even read. She finally had a full-blown nervous breakdown.
Unable and unwilling to continue, she wrote a note to her husband
saying that ""I am certain I am going mad again"" and ""I shan't recover
this time . . . I can't fight any longer . . . I can't go on spoiling
your life any longer."" On March 28, 1941, she left her home, walked to
the banks of the nearby River Ouse, loaded heavy stones into her
pockets and walked into the water. She was 59 years old."
Herman_Melville,"Herman Melville was an American novelist, short story writer, and poet of the American Renaissance period. Among his best-known works are Moby-Dick (1851); Typee (1846), a romanticized account of his experiences in Polynesia; and Billy Budd, Sailor, a posthumously published novella. Although his reputation was not high at the time of his death, the 1919 centennial of his birth was the starting point of a Melville revival, and Moby-Dick grew to be considered one of the great American novels."
Alphonse_Daudet,"Alphonse Daudet was born on 13 May 1840 in N√Æmes, France. He was a writer, known for Sapho (1934), Sapho (1917) and Sapho (1913). He was married to Julia Allard. He died on 16 December 1897 in Paris, France."
Mikhail_Sholokhov,"Mikhail Sholokhov was a Russian writer who received a Nobel prize for
his epic novel 'Tikhiy Don'.He was born in 1905 into a Cossack family of farmers in Kruzhilin,
Veshenskaya, Rostov province in Southern Russia. His high school
studies were interrupted by the Russian revolution and the Civil War,
in which he fought on the side of the revolutionaries and joined the
Red Army. From 1922-24 he lived in Moscow, where he attended ""writers
seminars"" and published his early works: ""A Test"" and ""The Birthmark"".
In 1924 he married Maria Gromoslavskaya in his native town, and the
couple had four children.His first book, ""Donskie Rasskazy"" (1925), exposed the bitter divide
among the Russian people during and after the Civil War. His epic novel
""And Quiet Flows the Don"", published in parts during 1928-40, shows the
turbulent life of Cossacks during the dramatic events of the Russian
revolution and Civil War. The main character, Grigori Melekhov, was
based on a historical prototype, 'Kharlampi Ermakov', a Cossack who
opposed the Communists and was imprisoned and executed in 1929.
Sholokhov's account of the conflict between Cossacks and Communists
caused a suspension of publication in 1929, but he managed to get
permission from Joseph Stalin to continue
the publication. The novel had over 100 million copies in print,
translated in 90+ languages worldwide.Sholokhov was only 22 in 1928, when he delivered the massive manuscript
of ""Quiet Flows the Don"" (book 1) to a Soviet publisher. It took him
almost 14 years to complete the novel of four books in 1940. This led
to a suggestion by
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn that
Sholokhov used the work of another Cossack writer, Fyodor Kryukov (who
died in 1920), for some parts of this epic work.Sholokhov had a lifelong political career. He was a co-chairman of the
Soviet Writers Union from the 1930s to his death in 1984. He traveled
in western Europe on several occasions, and also accompanied Soviet
leader Nikita Khrushchev to the US in
1959. He was awarded the 1965 Nobel Prize for Literature for his novels
and stories about the Cossacks in Russia, becoming the first and only
officially sanctioned Soviet writer to win the honor.Sholokhov took a hardline position against dissident writers, such as
Boris Pasternak, Solzhenitsyn, Sinyavsky
and Daniel. In 1965 he joined the side of
Leonid Brezhnev in the restoration of
the political image of Joseph Stalin. Such
restoration was opposed by such figures as
Andrei Sakharov,
Valentin Kataev,
Korney Ivanovich Chukovskiy,
Oleg Efremov, and
Maya Plisetskaya. Sholokhov remained a
hard-liner during the 60s and 70s. In late 70s he suffered
from diabetes and had a stroke, and later developed a throat cancer. He
was in denial of his medical condition. Shortly before his death he
rejected the doctor's advise and interrupted his treatment at the
Kremlin Hospital. Instead, he returned to his native village and died
there on February 21, 1984."
Stefan_Zweig,"Here he grew up in the educated Jewish middle class, together with his brother Alfred. The Zweig family was not religious. He passed his high school diploma at the Wasagymnasium in Vienna. Zweig wrote his first poems here. At that time he was influenced by writers such as Hugo von Hofmannstahl and Rainer Maria Rilke. In 1901, Stefan Zweig's first volume of poetry entitled ""Silberne Saiten"" was published. He also began translating works by French writers at this time. In 1904 he completed his doctorate in German and Romance studies. Until 1910 he traveled extensively through Europe. The focus here was on exchanges with other writers and artists, with whom he mostly maintained friendship through intensive correspondence. By 1911, works such as ""Tersites"", ""The House by the Sea"" and ""Burning Secret"" as well as his first biography ""√âmile Verhaeren"" had been created.With his work ""First Experience. Four Stories from Kinderland,"" Zweig approached an intuitive psychological style. At the beginning of the First World War, Stefan Zweig signed up as a volunteer. Here he was employed in the war press quarters until 1917. To demonstrate against war in any form, he wrote the drama ""Jeremiah"", which premiered in Zurich in 1918. From 1918 onwards, Zweig also worked as a journalist and correspondent for the Swiss newspaper ""Neue Freie Presse"". He also uses this medium to publish his non-partisan views. After the end of the war he settled in Salzburg. His idea was to found a spiritually, holistically and humanistically motivated alliance in Europe. So he began, initially in numerous lectures and essays, to warn against radicalization through nationalism and to call for calm, diplomacy and patience.In 1920, Zweig published the writings ""Fear"", ""The Compulsion"" and, from 1920, three essays about master builders of the world: ""Three Masters"", in 1925 ""The Fight with the Demon"" and in 1928 ""Three Poets of Their Life"". Zweig enjoyed great stage success in 1926 with his adaptation of Ben Jonson's ""Volpone"". The publication of the book ""Star Hours of Humanity"" in 1927 was equally successful. In 1928 he traveled to the Soviet Union, where his books were also published in Russian at the instigation of Maxim Gorki, with whom he corresponded. After the NSDAP came to power in Germany, Stefan Zweig fled to London for fear of persecution. The book ""Impatience of the Heart"" was written here. From 1934 onwards, his works were no longer published in Germany and with the annexation of Austria to the Third Reich in 1938, production in his homeland also stopped. In 1935, Zweig wrote the libretto for the opera ""Die schweigsame Frau"" for Richard Strauss.In 1936 the NSDAP immediately banned the sale of all of his works. His first marriage ended in divorce in 1938, and his second marriage was to Charlotte Altmann in 1939. In 1940 he received English citizenship from Great Britain. Nevertheless, he left Europe and traveled on to New York. In 1942 his chess novella and the monograph Brazil were published. After a short stay he visited Argentina and Paraguay. He then settled in Brazil. Here Stefan Zweig fell into deep sadness and depression.Stefan Zweig committed suicide on February 22, 1942 in Petr√≥polis, near Rio de Janeiro. In 1944 his autobiography was published posthumously under the title ""The World of Yesterday""."

He was married to Pilar del R√≠o and Ilda Reis. He died on 18 June 2010 in Lanzarote, Las Palmas, Canary Islands, Spain."
Bertolt_Brecht,"Bertolt Brecht was born on 10 February 1898 in Augsburg, Germany and one of
the country's most influential poets, playwrights and screenwriters.
His most famous work was the musical ""The Threepenny Opera"" (with
Kurt Weill), but his dramas such as ""Mother Courage and Her Children"" or
""The Good Person of Sezuan"" were equally successful. As he opposed the
upcoming Nazi movement, he fled Germany in 1933 and finally emigrated
to the United States. After testifying before the House Un-American
Activities Committee in 1947, he left Hollywood and returned to Europe.
He settled down in East Germany, where he founded the famous ""Berliner
Ensemble"" and became the state's intellectual hero. He died on 14
August 1956 in East Berlin."
Mario_Vargas_Llosa,"Jorge Mario Pedro Vargas Llosa, 1st Marquess of Vargas Llosa (born 28 March 1936), more commonly known as Mario Vargas Llosa (/Àåv…ëÀêr…°…ôs Ààjo äs…ô/;[4] Spanish: [Ààma…æjo ÀàŒ≤a…æ…£as Àà éosa]), is a Peruvian novelist, journalist, essayist and former politician. Vargas Llosa is one of Latin America's most significant novelists and essayists and one of the leading writers of his generation. Some critics consider him to have had a larger international impact and worldwide audience than any other writer of the Latin American Boom.[5] In 2010, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature, ""for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat.""[6] He also won the 1967 R√≥mulo Gallegos Prize, the 1986 Prince of Asturias Award, the 1994 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, the 1995 Jerusalem Prize, the 2012 Carlos Fuentes International Prize, and the 2018 Pablo Neruda Order of Artistic and Cultural Merit. In 2021, he was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise.[7]

Vargas Llosa rose to international fame in the 1960s with novels such as The Time of the Hero (La ciudad y los perros, literally The City and the Dogs, 1963/1966),[8] The Green House (La casa verde, 1965/1968), and the monumental Conversation in The Cathedral (Conversaci√≥n en La Catedral, 1969/1975). He writes, prolifically, across an array of literary genres, including literary criticism and journalism. His novels include comedies, murder mysteries, historical novels, and political thrillers. Several, such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (1973/1978) and Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter (1977/1982), have been adapted as feature films.

Many of Vargas Llosa's works are influenced by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian. Increasingly, he has expanded his range, and tackled themes that arise from other parts of the world. In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world.[9]

Like many Latin American writers, Vargas Llosa has been politically active throughout his career. While he initially supported the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro, Vargas Llosa later became disenchanted with its policies, particularly after the imprisonment of Cuban poet Heberto Padilla in 1971, and now he identifies as a liberal and holds anti-left wing ideas. He ran for the Peruvian presidency in 1990 with the center-right Frente Democr√°tico coalition advocating for liberal reforms, but lost the election to Alberto Fujimori. Since his exit from directly participating in politics in Peru, Vargas Llosa has advocated centre-right activists and candidates internationally.

Vargas Llosa is also one of the 25 leading figures on the Information and Democracy Commission launched by Reporters Without Borders.[10]

Early life and family

Mario Vargas Llosa's thesis ¬´Bases para una interpretaci√≥n de Rub√©n Dar√≠o¬ª, presented to his alma mater, the National University of San Marcos (Peru), in 1958.
Mario Vargas Llosa was born to a middle-class family[11] on 28 March 1936, in the southern Peruvian provincial city of Arequipa.[12] He was the only child of Ernesto Vargas Maldonado and Dora Llosa Ureta (the former a radio operator in an aviation company, the latter the daughter of an old criollo family), who separated a few months before his birth.[12] Shortly after Mario's birth, his father revealed that he was in a relationship with a German woman, from which Mario's two younger half-brothers would be born: Enrique and Ernesto Vargas.[13]

Vargas Llosa lived with his maternal family in Arequipa until a year after his parents divorced, when his maternal grandfather was named honorary consul for Peru in Bolivia.[12] With his mother and her family, Vargas Llosa then moved to Cochabamba, Bolivia, where he spent the early years of his childhood.[12] His maternal family, the Llosas, were sustained by his grandfather, who managed a cotton farm.[14] As a child, Vargas Llosa was led to believe that his father had died‚Äîhis mother and her family did not want to explain that his parents had separated.[15] During the government of Peruvian President Jos√© Bustamante y Rivero, Vargas Llosa's maternal grandfather obtained a diplomatic post in the northern Peruvian coastal city of Piura and the entire family returned to Peru.[15] While in Piura, Vargas Llosa attended elementary school at the religious academy Colegio Salesiano.[16] In 1946, at the age of ten, he moved to Lima and met his father for the first time.[16] His parents re-established their relationship and lived in Magdalena del Mar, a middle-class Lima suburb, during his teenage years.[17] While in Lima, he studied at the Colegio La Salle, a Catholic middle school, from 1947 to 1949.[18]

When Vargas Llosa was fourteen, his father sent him to the Leoncio Prado Military Academy in Lima.[19] At the age of 16, before his graduation, Vargas Llosa began working as a journalist for local newspapers.[20] He withdrew from the military academy and finished his studies in Piura, where he worked for the local newspaper, La Industria, and witnessed the theatrical performance of his first dramatic work, La huida del Inca.[21]

In 1953, during the government of Manuel A. Odr√≠a, Vargas Llosa enrolled in Lima's National University of San Marcos, to study law and literature.[22] While at the university, he was a member of a communist group, embracing the ideology due to corruption and inequality in Latin America.[23] He married Julia Urquidi, his maternal uncle's sister-in-law, in 1955 at the age of 19; she was 10 years older.[24] Vargas Llosa began his literary career in earnest, in 1957, with the publication of his first short stories, ""The Leaders"" (""Los jefes"") and ""The Grandfather"" (""El abuelo""), while working for two Peruvian newspapers.[25] Upon his graduation from the National University of San Marcos in 1958, he received a scholarship to study at the Complutense University of Madrid in Spain.[26]

In 1960, after his scholarship in Madrid had expired, Vargas Llosa moved to France, under the impression that he would receive a scholarship to study there. However, upon arriving in Paris, he learned that his scholarship request was denied.[27] Despite Mario and Julia's unexpected financial status, the couple decided to remain in Paris, where he began to write prolifically, even as a ghostwriter.[27][28] Their marriage lasted only a few more years, ending in divorce in 1964.[29] A year later, Vargas Llosa married his first cousin, Patricia Llosa,[23][29] with whom he had three children: √Ålvaro Vargas Llosa (born 1966), a writer and editor; Gonzalo (born 1967), an international civil servant; and Morgana (born 1974), a photographer.

Writing career
Beginning and first major works
Vargas Llosa's first novel, The Time of the Hero (La ciudad y los perros), was published in 1963. The book is set among a community of cadets in a Lima military school, and the plot is based on the author's own experiences at Lima's Leoncio Prado Military Academy.[30] This early piece gained wide public attention and immediate success.[31] Its vitality and adept use of sophisticated literary techniques immediately impressed critics,[32] and it won the Premio de la Cr√≠tica Espa√±ola award.[31] Nevertheless, its sharp criticism of the Peruvian military establishment led to controversy in Peru. Several Peruvian generals attacked the novel, claiming that it was the work of a ""degenerate mind"" and stating that Vargas Llosa was ""paid by Ecuador"" to undermine the prestige of the Peruvian Army.[31]

In 1965, Vargas Llosa published his second novel, The Green House (La casa verde), about a brothel called ""The Green House"" and how its quasi-mythical presence affects the lives of the characters. The main plot follows Bonifacia, a girl who is about to receive the vows of the church and her transformation into la Selvatica, the best-known prostitute of ""The Green House.‚Äù The novel was immediately acclaimed, confirming Vargas Llosa as an important voice of Latin American narrative.[33] The Green House won the first edition of the R√≥mulo Gallegos International Novel Prize in 1967, contending with works by veteran Uruguayan writer Juan Carlos Onetti and by Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez.[34] This novel, alone, accumulated enough awards to place the author among the leading figures of the Latin American Boom.[35] Some critics still consider The Green House to be Vargas Llosa's finest and most important achievement.[35] Indeed, Latin American literary critic Gerald Martin suggests that The Green House is ""one of the greatest novels to have emerged from Latin America"".[35]

Vargas Llosa's third novel, Conversation in The Cathedral (Conversaci√≥n en La Catedral), was published in 1969, when he was 33. This ambitious narrative is the story of Santiago Zavala, the son of a government minister, and Ambrosio, his chauffeur.[36] A random meeting at a dog pound leads the pair to a riveting conversation at a nearby bar known as ""The Cathedral"".[37] During the encounter, Zavala searches for the truth about his father's role in the murder of a notorious Peruvian underworld figure, shedding light on the workings of a dictatorship along the way.[38] Unfortunately for Zavala, his quest results in a dead end with no answers and no sign of a better future.[39] The novel attacks the dictatorial government of Odr√≠a by showing how a dictatorship controls and destroys lives.[31] The persistent theme of hopelessness makes Conversation in The Cathedral Vargas Llosa's most bitter novel.[39]

He lectured on Spanish American Literature at King's College London from 1969 to 1970.[40]

1970s and the ""discovery of humor""
In 1971, Vargas Llosa published Garc√≠a M√°rquez: Story of a Deicide (Garc√≠a M√°rquez: historia de un deicidio), which was his doctoral thesis for the Complutense University of Madrid.[41][42] Although Vargas Llosa wrote this book-length study about his then friend, the Colombian Nobel laureate writer Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, they did not speak to each other again. In 1976, Vargas Llosa punched Garc√≠a M√°rquez in the face in Mexico City at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, ending the friendship.[43] Neither writer had publicly stated the underlying reasons for the quarrel.[44] A photograph of Garc√≠a M√°rquez sporting a black eye was published in 2007, reigniting public interest in the feud.[45] Despite the decades of silence, in 2007, Vargas Llosa agreed to allow part of his book to be used as the introduction to a 40th-anniversary edition of Garc√≠a M√°rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude, which was re-released in Spain and throughout Latin America that year.[46] Historia de un Deicidio was also reissued in that year, as part of Vargas Llosa's complete works.

Following the monumental work Conversation in The Cathedral, Vargas Llosa's output shifted away from more serious themes such as politics and problems with society. Latin American literary scholar Raymond L. Williams describes this phase in his writing career as ""the discovery of humor"".[47] His first attempt at a satirical novel was Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (Pantale√≥n y las visitadoras), published in 1973.[48] This short, comic novel offers vignettes of dialogues and documents about the Peruvian armed forces and a corps of prostitutes assigned to visit military outposts in remote jungle areas.[49] These plot elements are similar to Vargas Llosa's earlier novel The Green House, but in a different form. Captain Pantoja and the Special Service is, therefore, essentially a parody of both The Green House and the literary approach that novel represents.[49] Vargas Llosa's motivation to write the novel came from actually witnessing prostitutes being hired by the Peruvian Army and brought to serve soldiers in the jungle.[50]

From 1974 to 1987, Vargas Llosa focused on his writing, but also took the time to pursue other endeavors.[51] In 1975, he co-directed an unsuccessful motion-picture adaptation of his novel, Captain Pantoja and the Secret Service.[51] In 1976 he was elected President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers and oldest human rights organisation, a position he held until 1979.[51] During this time, Vargas Llosa frequently traveled to speak at conferences organized by international institutions such as the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the University of Cambridge, where he was Sim√≥n Bol√≠var Professor and an Overseas Fellow of Churchill College in 1977‚Äì78.[52][53][54]

In 1977, Vargas Llosa was elected as a member of the Peruvian Academy of Language, a membership he still holds today. That year, he also published Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter (La t√≠a Julia y el escribidor), based in part on his marriage to his first wife, Julia Urquidi, to whom he dedicated the novel.[55] She later wrote a memoir, Lo que Varguitas no dijo (What Little Vargas Didn't Say), in which she gives her personal account of their relationship. She states that Vargas Llosa's account exaggerates many negative points in their courtship and marriage while minimizing her role of assisting his literary career.[56] Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter is considered one of the most striking examples of how the language and imagery of popular culture can be used in literature.[57] The novel was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, Tune in Tomorrow.

Vargas Llosa's fourth major novel, The War of the End of the World (La guerra del fin del mundo), was published in 1981 and was his first attempt at a historical novel.[58] This work initiated a radical change in Vargas Llosa's style towards themes such as messianism and irrational human behaviour.[59] It recreates the War of Canudos, an incident in 19th-century Brazil in which an armed millenarian cult held off a siege by the national army for months.[60] As in Vargas Llosa's earliest work, this novel carries a sober and serious theme, and its tone is dark.[60] Vargas Llosa's bold exploration of humanity's propensity to idealize violence, and his account of a man-made catastrophe brought on by fanaticism on all sides, earned the novel substantial recognition.[61] Because of the book's ambition and execution, critics have argued that this is one of Vargas Llosa's greatest literary pieces.[61] Even though the novel has been acclaimed in Brazil, it was initially poorly received because a foreigner was writing about a Brazilian theme.[62] The book was also criticized as revolutionary and anti-socialist.[63] Vargas Llosa says that this book is his favorite and was his most difficult accomplishment.[63]

After completing The War of the End of the World, Vargas Llosa began to write novels that were significantly shorter than many of his earlier books. In 1983, he finished The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta (Historia de Mayta, 1984).[58] The novel focuses on a leftist insurrection that took place on 29 May 1962, in the Andean city of Jauja.[58] Later the same year, during the Sendero Luminoso uprising, Vargas Llosa was asked by the Peruvian President Fernando Bela√∫nde Terry to join the Investigatory Commission, a task force to inquire into the massacre of eight journalists at the hands of the villagers of Uchuraccay.[64] The commission's main purpose was to investigate the murders in order to provide information regarding the incident to the public.[65] Following his involvement with the Investigatory Commission, Vargas Llosa published a series of articles to defend his position in the affair.[65] In 1986, he completed his next novel, Who Killed Palomino Molero (¬øQui√©n mat√≥ a Palomino Molero?), which he began writing shortly after the end of the Uchuraccay investigation.[65] Though the plot of this mystery novel is similar to the tragic events at Uchuraccay, literary critic Roy Boland points out that it was not an attempt to reconstruct the murders, but rather a ""literary exorcism"" of Vargas Llosa's own experiences during the commission.[66] The experience also inspired one of Vargas Llosa's later novels, Death in the Andes (Lituma en los Andes), originally published in 1993 in Barcelona.[67]

It was almost 20 years before Vargas Llosa wrote another major work: The Feast of the Goat (La fiesta del chivo), a political thriller, was published in 2000 (and in English in 2001). According to Williams, it is Vargas Llosa's most complete and most ambitious novel since The War of the End of the World.[68] Critic Sabine Koellmann sees it in the line of his earlier novels such as ""Conversaci√≥n en La Catedral"" depicting the effects of authoritarianism, violence and the abuse of power on the individual.[69] Based on the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo, who governed the Dominican Republic from 1930 until his assassination in 1961, the novel has three main strands: one concerns Urania Cabral, the daughter of a former politician and Trujillo loyalist, who returns for the first time since leaving the Dominican Republic after Trujillo's assassination 30 years earlier; the second concentrates on the assassination itself, the conspirators who carry it out, and its consequences; and the third and final strand deals with Trujillo himself in scenes from the end of his regime.[68] The book quickly received positive reviews in Spain and Latin America,[70] and has had a significant impact in Latin America, being regarded as one of Vargas Llosa's best works.[68]

In 2003 he wrote The Way to Paradise in which he studies Flora Tristan and Paul Gauguin.

In 2006, Vargas Llosa wrote The Bad Girl (Travesuras de la ni√±a mala), which journalist Kathryn Harrison argues is a rewrite (rather than simply a recycling) of Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary (1856).[71] In Vargas Llosa's version, the plot relates the decades-long obsession of its narrator, a Peruvian expatriate in Paris, with a woman with whom he first fell in love when both were teenagers.

In 2019 he published the novel Tiempos recios (Harsh Times), about the 1954 coup in Guatemala.[72]

Political career
Turn to liberalism

Like many other Latin American intellectuals, Vargas Llosa was initially a supporter of the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro.[33] He studied Marxism in depth as a university student and was later persuaded by communist ideals after the success of the Cuban Revolution.[73] Gradually, Vargas Llosa came to believe that socialism was incompatible with what he considered to be general liberties and freedoms.[74] The official rupture between the writer and the policies of the Cuban government occurred with the so-called 'Padilla Affair', when the Castro regime imprisoned the poet Heberto Padilla for a month in 1971.[75] Vargas Llosa, along with other intellectuals of the time, wrote to Castro protesting the Cuban political system and its imprisonment of the artist.[76] Vargas Llosa has identified himself with liberalism rather than extreme left-wing political ideologies ever since.[77] Since he relinquished his earlier leftism, he has opposed both left- and right-wing authoritarian regimes.[78]

Investigatory Commission

With his appointment to the Investigatory Commission on the Uchuraccay massacre [es] in 1983, he experienced what literary critic Jean Franco calls ""the most uncomfortable event in [his] political career"".[67] Unfortunately for Vargas Llosa, his involvement with the Investigatory Commission led to immediate negative reactions and defamation from the Peruvian press; many suggested that the massacre was a conspiracy to keep the journalists from reporting the presence of government paramilitary forces in Uchuraccay.[65] The commission concluded that it was the indigenous villagers who had been responsible for the killings; for Vargas Llosa the incident showed ""how vulnerable democracy is in Latin America and how easily it dies under dictatorships of the right and left"".[79] These conclusions, and Vargas Llosa personally, came under intense criticism: anthropologist Enrique Mayer, for instance, accused him of ""paternalism"",[80] while fellow anthropologist Carlos Iv√°n Degregori criticized him for his ignorance of the Andean world.[81] Vargas Llosa was accused of actively colluding in a government cover-up of army involvement in the massacre.[65] American Latin American literature scholar Misha Kokotovic summarizes that the novelist was charged with seeing ""indigenous cultures as a 'primitive' obstacle to the full realization of his Western model of modernity"".[82] Shocked both by the atrocity itself and then by the reaction his report had provoked, Vargas Llosa responded that his critics were apparently more concerned with his report than with the hundreds of peasants who later died at the hands of the Sendero Luminoso guerrilla organization.[83]

Presidential candidacy
Main article: 1990 Peruvian general election
In 1987, he helped form and soon became a leader of the center-right party Movimiento Libertad.[84] The following year his party entered a coalition with the parties of Peru's two principal conservative politicians at the time, ex-president Fernando Bela√∫nde Terry (of the Popular Action party) and Luis Bedoya Reyes (of the Partido Popular Cristiano), to form the tripartite center-right coalition known as Frente Democr√°tico (FREDEMO).[84] He ran for the presidency of Peru in 1990 as the candidate of the FREDEMO coalition with the support of the United States.[85] Many of Peru's political elite in the twenty first century would begin their careers in FREDEMO.[86] He proposed neoliberal policies similar to Fujimori that included a drastic economic austerity program that frightened most of the country's poor; this program emphasized the need for privatization, a market economy, free trade, and most importantly, the dissemination of private property.[87][88]

Vargas Llosa, according to Rospigliosi, inspired some of the objectives drafted by the Peruvian Armed Forces in Plan Verde, specifically in the volume titled ""Driving Peru into the XXI century"", which outlined Peru becoming a neoliberal country and called for the extermination of vulnerable populations deemed as economically burdensome.[89] Members of the Peruvian Armed Forces who drafted Plan Verde initially expected Vargas Llosa to win the presidency and support their objectives.[90][89] Although Vargas Llosa won the first round with 34% of the vote, Vargas Llosa was defeated by a then-unknown agricultural engineer, Alberto Fujimori, in the subsequent run-off.[88] Vargas Llosa included an account of his run for the presidency in the memoir A Fish in the Water (El pez en el agua, 1993).[91]

Later life

Vargas Llosa has mainly lived in Madrid since the 1990s, but spends roughly three months of the year in Peru with his extended family.[88][92] He also frequently visits London where he occasionally spends long periods. Vargas Llosa acquired Spanish citizenship in 1993, though he still holds Peruvian nationality. The writer often reiterates his love for both countries. In his Nobel speech he observed: ""I carry Peru deep inside me because that is where I was born, grew up, was formed, and lived those experiences of childhood and youth that shaped my personality and forged my calling"". He then added: ""I love Spain as much as Peru, and my debt to her is as great as my gratitude. If not for Spain, I never would have reached this podium or become a known writer"".[93]

Mario Vargas Llosa served as a visiting professor of Latin American studies at Harvard University during the 1992‚Äì1993 academic year.[94] Harvard later recognized Vargas Llosa by conferring upon him an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1999.[95] In 1994 he was elected a member of the Real Academia Espa√±ola (Royal Spanish Academy), he took up seat L on 15 January 1996.[96][97] Vargas Llosa joined the Mont Pelerin Society in 2014.[98] He is also a member of Washington, D.C. based think tank, the Inter-American Dialogue.[99]

Panama and Pandora Papers
Vargas Llosa was named in both the Panama Papers (2016) and Pandora Papers (2021) released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.[100] According to IDL-Reporteros, the British Virgin Islands company Melek Investing Inc. was documented to be owned by Vargas Llosa, and was used for book royalty profits and the sale of real estate in London and Madrid.[100] Following the Panama Papers leak in 2016, Carmen Balcells said on behalf of Vargas Llosa that investments were made ""without the consent of Messrs. Vargas Llosa"" while in the 2021 Pandora Papers leaks, Javier Mart√≠n, a representative of Vargas Llosa, said the writer ""was not aware of the ownership of that company"".[100] IDL-Reporteros provided a document showing Vargas Llosa's signature on a ""Consent to Act as Director"" form for Melek Investing Inc. as part of the 2021 leak.[100]

Style of writing
Plot, setting, and major themes
Vargas Llosa's style encompasses historical material as well as his own personal experiences.[101] For example, in his first novel, The Time of the Hero, his own experiences at the Leoncio Prado military school informed his depiction of the corrupt social institution which mocked the moral standards it was supposed to uphold.[30] Furthermore, the corruption of the book's school is a reflection of the corruption of Peruvian society at the time the novel was written.[32] Vargas Llosa frequently uses his writing to challenge the inadequacies of society, such as demoralization and oppression by those in political power towards those who challenge this power. One of the main themes he has explored in his writing is the individual's struggle for freedom within an oppressive reality.[102] For example, his two-volume novel Conversation in The Cathedral is based on the tyrannical dictatorship of Peruvian President Manuel A. Odr√≠a.[103] The protagonist, Santiago, rebels against the suffocating dictatorship by participating in the subversive activities of leftist political groups.[104] In addition to themes such as corruption and oppression, Vargas Llosa's second novel, The Green House, explores ""a denunciation of Peru's basic institutions"", dealing with issues of abuse and exploitation of the workers in the brothel by corrupt military officers.[47]

Many of Vargas Llosa's earlier novels were set in Peru, while in more recent work he has expanded to other regions of Latin America, such as Brazil and the Dominican Republic.[105] His responsibilities as a writer and lecturer have allowed him to travel frequently and led to settings for his novels in regions outside of Peru.[51] The War of the End of the World was his first major work set outside Peru.[31] Though the plot deals with historical events of the Canudos revolt against the Brazilian government, the novel is not based directly on historical fact; rather, its main inspiration is the non-fiction account of those events published by Brazilian writer Euclides da Cunha in 1902.[60] The Feast of the Goat, based on the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo, takes place in the Dominican Republic;[68] in preparation for this novel, Vargas Llosa undertook a comprehensive study of Dominican history.[106] The novel was characteristically realist, and Vargas Llosa underscores that he ""respected the basic facts, ... I have not exaggerated"", but at the same time he points out ""It's a novel, not a history book, so I took many, many liberties.""[107]

One of Vargas Llosa's more recent novels, The Way to Paradise (El para√≠so en la otra esquina), is set largely in Tahiti in France.[108] Based on the biography of former social reformer Flora Tristan, it demonstrates how Flora and Paul Gauguin were unable to find paradise, but were still able to inspire followers to keep working towards a socialist utopia.[109] Unfortunately, Vargas Llosa was not as successful in transforming these historical figures into fiction. Some critics, such as Barbara Mujica, argue that The Way to Paradise lacks the ""audacity, energy, political vision, and narrative genius"" that was present in his previous works.[110]

Modernism and postmodernism
The works of Mario Vargas Llosa are viewed as both modernist and postmodernist novels.[111] Though there is still much debate over the differences between modernist and postmodernist literature, literary scholar M. Keith Booker claims that the difficulty and technical complexity of Vargas Llosa's early works, such as The Green House and Conversation in The Cathedral, are clearly elements of the modern novel.[35] Furthermore, these earlier novels all carry a certain seriousness of attitude‚Äîanother important defining aspect of modernist art.[111] By contrast, his later novels such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta, and The Storyteller (El hablador) appear to follow a postmodernist mode of writing.[112] These novels have a much lighter, farcical, and comic tone, characteristics of postmodernism.[49] Comparing two of Vargas Llosa's novels, The Green House and Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Booker discusses the contrast between modernism and postmodernism found in the writer's works: while both novels explore the theme of prostitution as well as the workings of the Peruvian military, Booker points out that the former is gravely serious whereas the latter is ridiculously comic.[49]

Interlacing dialogues

Literary scholar M. Keith Booker argues that Vargas Llosa perfects the technique of interlacing dialogues in his novel The Green House.[49] By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates the illusion of a flashback. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places.[113] This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using near the end of his first novel, The Time of the Hero.[114] However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in The Green House the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space.[115] In contrast, Captain Pantoja and the Special Service employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts.[116] This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf's mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.[113] This was seen to occur yet again in Vargas Llosa's most current work, ""Tiempos Recios,"" as two dialogues, one between Trujillo and Castillo Armas, and another between Trujillo and Abbes Garc√≠a, are juxtaposed.

Literary influences

Mario Vargas Llosa (2012)
Vargas Llosa's first literary influences were relatively obscure Peruvian writers such as Mart√≠n Ad√°n, Carlos Oquendo de Amat, and C√©sar Moro.[117] As a young writer, he looked to these revolutionary novelists in search of new narrative structures and techniques in order to delineate a more contemporary, multifaceted experience of urban Peru. He was looking for a style different from the traditional descriptions of land and rural life made famous by Peru's foremost novelist at the time, Jos√© Mar√≠a Arguedas.[118] Vargas Llosa wrote of Arguedas's work that it was ""an example of old-fashioned regionalism that had already exhausted its imaginary possibilities"".[117] Although he did not share Arguedas's passion for indigenous reality, Vargas Llosa admired and respected the novelist for his contributions to Peruvian literature.[119] Indeed, he has published a book-length study on his work, La utop√≠a arcaica (1996).

Rather than restrict himself to Peruvian literature, Vargas Llosa also looked abroad for literary inspiration. Two French figures, existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre and novelist Gustave Flaubert, influenced both his technique and style.[120] Sartre's influence is most prevalent in Vargas Llosa's extensive use of conversation.[121] The epigraph of The Time of the Hero, his first novel, is also taken directly from Sartre's work.[122] Flaubert's artistic independence‚Äîhis novels' disregard of reality and morals‚Äîhas always been admired by Vargas Llosa,[123] who wrote a book-length study of Flaubert's aesthetics, The Perpetual Orgy.[124] In his analysis of Flaubert, Vargas Llosa questions the revolutionary power of literature in a political setting; this is in contrast to his earlier view that ""literature is an act of rebellion"", thus marking a transition in Vargas Llosa's aesthetic beliefs.[125] Other critics such as Sabine K√∂llmann argue that his belief in the transforming power of literature is one of the great continuities that characterize his fictional and non-fictional work, and link his early statement that 'Literature is Fire' with his Nobel Prize Speech 'In Praise of Reading and Writing'.[126]

One of Vargas Llosa's favourite novelists, and arguably the most influential on his writing career, is the American William Faulkner.[127] Vargas Llosa considers Faulkner ""the writer who perfected the methods of the modern novel"".[128] Both writers' styles include intricate changes in time and narration.[121][128] In The Time of the Hero, for example, aspects of Vargas Llosa's plot, his main character's development and his use of narrative time are influenced by his favourite Faulkner novel, Light in August.[129]

In addition to the studies of Arguedas and Flaubert, Vargas Llosa has written literary criticisms of other authors that he has admired, such as Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Albert Camus, Ernest Hemingway, and Jean-Paul Sartre.[130] The main goals of his non-fiction works are to acknowledge the influence of these authors on his writing, and to recognize a connection between himself and the other writers;[130] critic Sara Castro-Klar√©n argues that he offers little systematic analysis of these authors' literary techniques.[130] In The Perpetual Orgy, for example, he discusses the relationship between his own aesthetics and Flaubert's, rather than focusing on Flaubert's alone.[131]

Political views
Since distancing himself from left-wing politics, he has embraced right-wing politics.[132] In 1989, The Washington Post would write that though Vargas Llosa's party appeared center-right, ""he has ties with far-right politicians in other countries"".[133] Vargas Llosa has continued to be criticized due to his association with far-right groups and politicians.[134][135][136][137][138] The Christian Science Monitor would call Vargas Llosa ""a right-wing maverick""[86] while Jacobin would plainly describe him as a ""far-right novelist"".[139]

Vargas Llosa has described himself as a supporter of liberalism and said that the individuals who have had most impact on his political thought have included Karl Popper, Friedrich Hayek and Isaiah Berlin.[132] According to The Nation, Vargas Llosa would condemn leftist groups entirely due to the controversies of some while minimizing similar actions by neoliberal governments.[132]

He supported right-wing libertarian candidate Javier Milei in the 2023 Argentine general election.[140]

Chile
Following the arrest of Augusto Pinochet for crimes against humanity in 1999, Vargas Llosa would write an op-ed in The New York Times asking why left wing dictators were also not being arrested.[141] During the 2021 Chilean general elections, Vargas Llosa expressed support for conservative presidential candidate Jos√© Antonio Kast.[135][141]

Brazil
During the 2022 Brazilian general election, Vargas Llosa expressed his endorsement for conservative leader Jair Bolsonaro.[142] ""The case of Bolsonaro it's a hard question. His jokes are very hard to endorse, for a liberal [...] Now, between Bolsonaro and Lula, I prefer Bolsonaro. Even with jokes from Bolsonaro, Lula no."" said Vargas Llosa at a conference.[143]

Mexico
A month after losing the election, at the invitation of Octavio Paz, Vargas Llosa attended a conference in Mexico entitled, ""The 20th Century: The Experience of Freedom"". Focused on the collapse of communist rule in central and eastern Europe, it was broadcast on Mexican television from 27 August to 2 September. Addressing the conference on 30 August 1990, Vargas Llosa embarrassed his hosts by condemning the Mexican system of power based on the rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which had been in power for 61 years. Criticizing the PRI by name, he commented, ""I don't believe that there has been in Latin America any case of a system of dictatorship which has so efficiently recruited the intellectual milieu, bribing it with great subtlety."" He declared, ""Mexico is the perfect dictatorship. The perfect dictatorship is not communism, not the USSR, not Fidel Castro; the perfect dictatorship is Mexico. Because it is a camouflaged dictatorship.""[144][145] The statement, ""Mexico is the perfect dictatorship"" became a clich√© in Mexico[146] and internationally, until the PRI fell from power in 2000.

Peru
In April 2011, the writer took part in the 2011 Peruvian general election by saying he was going to vote for Alejandro Toledo (Peruvian former president 2001‚Äì2006). After casting his vote, he said his country should stay in the path of legality and freedom.[147][148]

Since her introduction into politics, Vargas Llosa has had a complex opinion on conservative politician Keiko Fujimori, daughter of president of Peru Alberto Fujimori. During her candidacy in the 2011 Peruvian general election, Vargas Llosa said ""the worst option is that of Keiko Fujimori because it means the legitimation of one of the worst dictatorships that Peru has had in its history‚Äù, endorsing and calling for Peruvian voters to consider left-wing candidate Ollanta Humala.[149] After Fujimori announced her candidacy for the 2016 Peruvian general election, Vargas Llosa said in 2014 ""Keiko is the daughter of a murderer and a thief who is imprisoned, tried by civil courts with international observers, sentenced to 25 years in prison for murder and theft. I do not want her to win the elections"".[150] However, in the second round of the 2021 Peruvian general election, Vargas Llosa expressed support for Keiko, sharing opposition to far-left candidate Pedro Castillo and describing Fujimori as the ""lesser of two evils"".[151][152][153] French intellectuals, who criticized his addition to the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise, said that Vargas Llosa contributed to the Peruvian political crisis during the 2021 Peruvian general election.[137]

Spain
In February 2008 he ended his support for the People's Party in favor of the recently created Union, Progress and Democracy, claiming that certain conservative views held by the former party are at odds with his classical liberal beliefs. His political ideologies appear in the book Pol√≠tica razonable, written with Fernando Savater, Rosa D√≠ez, √Ålvaro Pombo, Albert Boadella and Carlos Mart√≠nez Gorriar√°n.[154] He continued to write, both journalism and fiction, and to travel extensively. He also taught as a visiting professor at a number of prominent universities.[155]

Vargas Llosa is opposed to Catalan independence from Spain. Attending an anti-independence rally in October 2017, he said: ""Spanish democracy is here to stay. No separatist conspiracy can destroy it.""[156] In 2021 he attended a rally against the pardon of the Catalan independence leaders in Madrid.[157][158]

Later personal life and interests

He has declared himself a music lover, ensuring that feels a special fondness for Gustav Mahler.[159]

Vargas Llosa is an agnostic, ""I was not a believer, nor was I an atheist either, but, rather, an agnostic"".[160]

As for hobbies, he is fond of association football and is a supporter of Universitario de Deportes.[161] The writer himself has confessed in his book A Fish in the Water since childhood he has been a fan of the 'cream colored' team from Peru, which was first seen in the field one day in 1946 when he was only 10 years old.[162] In February 2011, Vargas Llosa was awarded an honorary life membership of this football club, in a ceremony which took place in the Monumental Stadium of Lima.[163][164]

Starting in 2015, Vargas Llosa was in a relationship with Filipina Spanish socialite and TV personality Isabel Preysler and divorced his first cousin Patricia Llosa.[23][165][166] In December 2022, it was announced Vargas Llosa and Preysler had split up.[167]

He was infected with COVID-19 and was hospitalized in April 2022.[168]

Impact
Mario Vargas Llosa is considered a major Latin American writer, alongside other authors such as Octavio Paz, Julio Cort√°zar, Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Carlos Fuentes and Isabel Allende.[169] In his book The New Novel in Latin America (La Nueva Novela), Fuentes offers an in-depth literary criticism of the positive influence Vargas Llosa's work has had on Latin American literature.[170] Indeed, for the literary critic Gerald Martin, writing in 1987, Vargas Llosa was ""perhaps the most successful ... certainly the most controversial Latin American novelist of the past twenty-five years"".[171]

Most of Vargas Llosa's narratives have been translated into multiple languages, marking his international critical success.[169] Vargas Llosa is also noted for his substantial contribution to journalism, an accomplishment characteristic of few other Latin American writers.[172] He is recognized among those who have most consciously promoted literature in general, and more specifically the novel itself, as avenues for meaningful commentary about life.[173] During his career, he has written more than a dozen novels and many other books and stories, and, for decades, he has been a voice for Latin American literature.[174]

A number of Vargas Llosa's works have been adapted for the screen, including The Time of the Hero and Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (both by the Peruvian director Francisco Lombardi) and The Feast of the Goat (by Vargas Llosa's cousin, Luis Llosa).[175] Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter was turned into the English-language film, Tune in Tomorrow. The Feast of the Goat has also been adapted as a theatrical play by Jorge Al√≠ Triana, a Colombian playwright and director.[176]

An important distinction he has received is the 1994 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, considered the most important accolade in Spanish-language literature and awarded to authors whose ""work has contributed to enrich, in a notable way, the literary patrimony of the Spanish language"".[178] In 2002, Vargas was the recipient of the PEN/Nabokov Award. Vargas Llosa also received the 2005 Irving Kristol Award from the American Enterprise Institute and was the 2008 recipient of the Harold and Ethel L. Stellfox Visiting Scholar and Writers Award at Dickinson College.[179]

On 7 October 2010 the Swedish Academy announced that the 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Vargas Llosa ""for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat.""[180] The decision to award Vargas Llosa the Nobel Prize in Literature was well received around the world.[181]

On 18 November 2010, Vargas Llosa received the honorary degree Degree of Letters from the City College of New York of the City University of New York, where he also delivered the President's Lecture.[182]

On 4 February 2011, Vargas Llosa was raised into the Spanish nobility by King Juan Carlos I with the hereditary title of Marqu√©s de Vargas Llosa (Marquess of Vargas Llosa).[183][184]

On 25 November 2021, Vargas Llosa was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise.[185]"
T_S_Eliot,"T.S. Eliot ranks with
William Butler Yeats as the
greatest English language poet of the 20th Century and was certainly
the most influential. He was born Thomas Stearns Eliot into the bosom
of a respectable middle class family on September 26, 1888 in St.
Louis, Missouri. The family had roots in New England, and Eliot spent
summers in Gloucester, Massachusetts. There was little doubt that he
would matriculate at Harvard -- his cousin, Charles William Eliot was
the 24th president of Harvard and turned it into a great research
university during his 40-year-tenure -- and after graduating from the
Milton Academy in 1906, it was off to Cambridge (on the left sight of
The Pond) he went. (His cousin Charles spent his last three years as
president during Thomas' first three years at the venerable
institution.)Though deeply committed to literature, Eliot studied philosophy with
George Santayana, William James, and
Bertrand Russell (who was a visiting
professor) at Harvard. Eliot completed his undergraduate degree in
three instead of the usual four years and stayed on at Harvard as a
teaching assistant for another year. He then studied philosophy at the
Sorbonne in Paris for a year before returning to Harvard in 1911 to get
his PhD.He decided to spend 1914-15 at the University of Marburg in Germany,
but his plans were dashed by the declaration of the First World War. He
won a scholarship to attend Merton College at Oxford and that changed
his life as it put him in the vicinity of London. In London, he met
Ezra Pound, Il miglior fabbro (Italian for
""the better craftsman,"" the dedication Eliot gave Pound on the title
page of ""The Waste Land"", which Pound edited), who championed him and
provided him with vital contacts. Though Eliot completed his doctoral
dissertation, he never returned to Harvard to defend it, so was never
awarded his PhD.Eliot had come to loathe academia and supported himself by working in a
bank as he forged his literary reputation. (Later, he became an editor
at the London publisher Faber and Faber.) Enamored of England, he spent
the rest of his life there, becoming a British subject in 1927. Deeply
conservative, the rigid class hierarchies of England appealed to him.
He eschewed the Unitarianism of his family and became an ardent
Anglo-Catholic within the bosom of the Church of England. Time Magazine
titled its review of his ""Collected Poems"" in 1936 ""Royalist,
Classicist, Anglo-Catholic"".Eliot's first marriage to Vivienne Haigh-Wood, whom he wed in 1915
(partly to gain residency in England), was a disaster. Vivienne's
biographer, Carole Seymour-Jones, attributed the strain in the marriage
partly to what she contends was Eliot's closet homosexuality, though
Vivienne's mental instability and poor health were major factors in the
deterioration of their relationship. Eliot eventually had to
institutionalize her. Eliot also suffered from mental problems and
suffered a breakdown in 1921 and was treated at a sanitarium in
Switzerland.The brilliant though emotionally troubled artist, whom the New York
Times in its obituary called ""the poet of gray melancholy,"", created
some of the greatest masterpieces of English literature, beginning with
""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"" (written in America and published
in 1915) and including ""Gerontion ""(1920), ""The Waste Land"" (1922) and
""The Hollow Men"" (1925). The ""Waste Land"" was a watershed of literary
modernism and revolutionized Anglo-American letters.In addition to his great poetry, Eliot was an accomplished playwright,
best known for
""Murder in the Cathedral (1951)""
(1935), ""The Family Reunion"" (1935), and ""The Cocktail Party"" (1949).
He won a Tony Award for Best Play when ""The Cocktail Party"" was
produced on Broadway in 1950. Thirty-three years later, Eliot won two
more Tony Awards, posthumously, for ""Cats"", cited for Best Book of a
Musical and Best Original Score as the lyricist. Based on his book of
whimsical poems, ""Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats"", the musical
""Cats"" was the longest-running show in Broadway history, racking up
7,485 performances when it closed its 18-year-run in the year 2000.
(Its record eventually was overtaken by
Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical
version of
–ü—Ä–∏–∑—Ä–∞–∫ –æ–ø–µ—Ä—ã (1925).)Eliot also busied himself as belletrist and essayist. While his belles
lettres on literary topics are valuable, his essays on the human
condition are less so due to his illiberal point of view. Fittingly,
upon being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1948, the Swedish
Academy lauded Eliot ""for his outstanding, pioneer contribution to
present-day poetry"".Viv died in 1947. Ten years later, the 68 year-old Eliot married Esm√©
Valerie Fletcher, who was 36 years his junior. Esm√© had been his
secretary at Faber and Faber since 1949 and would be his widow when he
died on January 4, 1965 at the age of 76."
Guy_De_Maupassant,"Guy de Maupassant was born on 5 August 1850 in Ch√¢teau de Miromesnil, France.

John_Keats,"John Keats (31 October 1795 - 23 February 1821) was an English poet of the second generation of Romantic poets, with Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley, although his poems had been in publication for less than four years when he died of tuberculosis at the age of 25. They were indifferently received in his lifetime, but his fame grew rapidly after his death. By the end of the century, he was placed in the canon of English literature, strongly influencing many writers of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood; the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica of 1888 called one ode ""one of the final masterpieces"". Jorge Luis Borges named his first encounter with Keats an experience he felt all his life. Keats had a style ""heavily loaded with sensuality's"", notably in the series of odes. Typically of the Romantics, he accentuated extreme emotion through natural imagery. Today his poems and letters remain among the most popular and analyzed in English literature - in particular ""Ode to a Nightingale"", ""Ode on a Grecian Urn"", ""Sleep and Poetry"" and the sonnet ""On First Looking into Chapman's Homer""."
Ahmet_Hamdi_Tanpinar,"Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar was born on 23 June 1901 in Constantinople, Ottoman Empire [now Istanbul, Turkey]. He was a writer, known for –ì–¥–µ —Ç—ã, –§–∏—Ä—É–∑–∞? (2004), Yaz Yagmuru (1994) and Ge√ßmis Zaman Elbiseleri (1975). He died on 24 January 1962 in Istanbul, Turkey."

Isaac_Asimov,"Isaac Asimov was born Isaak Judah Ozimov, on January 2, 1920, in
Petrovichi shtetl, near Smolensk, Russia. He was the oldest of three
children. His father, named Judah Ozimov, and his mother, named Anna
Rachel Ozimov (nee Berman), were Orthodox Jews. Ozimov family were
millers (the name Ozimov comes from the eponymous sort of wheat in
Russian). In 1923 Isaac with his parents immigrated to the USA and
settled in Brooklyn, New York. There his parents temporarily changed
his birthday to September 7, 1919, in order to send him to school a
year earlier. Their family name was changed from Ozimov to Asimov.Asimov was an avid reader before the age of 5. He spoke Yiddish and
English at home with his parents and spoke only a few word in Russian.
He began his formal education in 1925 in the New York Public School
system. From 1930-1932 he was placed in the rapid advance course. In
1935 he graduated from high school, in 1939 received a B.S. and in 1941
he earned his M. Sc. in Chemistry from Columbia University. From
1942-1945 Asimov was a chemist at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard's
Naval Air experimental station. After the war ended, he was drafted
into the U.S. Army and was transfered to the island of Oahu and was
destined to participate in the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll in
July 1946. He narrowly avoided that by receiving an honorable discharge
in May 1946. In 1948 he completed his post-graduate studies and earned
his Ph. D. in Chemistry. In 1949 he began his teaching career at the
Medical School of Boston University, becoming assistant professor in
1951, and associate professor in 1955. In 1958 Asimov became a
full-time writer and gave up his teaching duties because his income
from his literary works was much greater than his professor's salary.
He was fired, but he retained his title and later returned as a
lecturer and was promoted to the rank of full professor in 1979. Asimov
was considered one of the best lecturers at Boston University.Young Isaac Asimov was raised as a non-religious person. His parents
observed the Orthodox Judaism, but did not force their belief upon
young Asimov. He did not have affiliation with a temple, did not have a
bar mizvah and called himself an atheist, then used the term ""humanist""
in his later life. He did not oppose genuine religious convictions in
others but opposed superstitious or unfounded beliefs. Asimov defined
his intellectual position as a Humanist and rationalist. He opposed the
Vietnam war in the 1960s and was a supporter of the Democratic party.
He embraced environmental issues, and supported feminism, joking that
he wished women to be free ""because I hate it when they charge"". He was
also humorous about many of his memberships in various clubs and
foundations. Asimov did not approve exclusionary societies, he left
Mensa after he found that many of the members were arrogant. He liked
individuality and stayed in groups where he enjoyed giving speeches. As
a free thinker, Asimov saw sci-fi literature serving as a pool where
ideas and hypotheses are expressed with unrestricted intellectual
freedom.Young Asimov was fascinated with science fiction magazines which were
sold at his parent's general store. Around the age of 11 he wrote eight
chapters of a fiction about adventures of young boys in a small town.
His first publication was ""Marooned Off Vesta"" in the Amazing Stories
magazine in 1939. Asimov shot to fame in 1941 with 'Nightfall', a story
of a planet where night comes once every 2049 years. 'Nightfall' has
been described as one of the best science fiction stories ever written.
Asimov wrote over five hundred literary works. He is credited for
introducing the words ""positronic"", ""psychohistory"", and ""robotics""
into the English language. He penned such classics as ""I, Robot"" and
the ""Foundation"" series, which are considered to be the most impressive
of his writings. He also founded ""Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction
Magazine"", which became a best-selling publication.Asimov was afraid of needles and the sight of blood. Although he had
the highest score on the intelligence test he had the lowest score on
the physical-conditioning test. He never learned how to swim or ride a
bicycle. The author who described spaceflights suffered from fear of
flying. In his entire life he had to fly only twice during his military
service. Acrophobia was revealed when he took his date and first love
on a roller coaster in 1940, and was terrified. This phobia complicated
the logistics and limited the range over which he traveled; it also
found reflection in some of his literary works. He avoided traveling
long distances. Instead he enjoyed cruise ships like the RMS Queen
Elizabeth 2, where he occasionally entertained passengers with his
science-themed talks. He impressed public with his highly entertaining
speeches as well as with his sharp sense of timing; he never looked at
the clock, but he spoke for precisely the time allocated. Asimov's
sense of time prevented him from ever being late to a meeting. Once he
discovered that his parents changed his date of birth, he insisted that
the official records of his birthday be corrected to January 2, 1920,
the date he personally celebrated throughout his life.Asimov met Gertrude Blugherman on a blind date on Valentine's Day in
February of 1942, they got married in July of the same year. The
Asimovs had two children, son David (born in 1951), and daughter Robyn
Joan (born in 1955). Asimov had known Janet Opal Jeppson since 1959.
She was a psychoanalyst and also a writer of science fiction for
children. Correspondence with her convinced Asimov that she was the
right kind of person for him. He and Gertrude were separated in 1970,
and he moved in with Janet Jappeson almost at once. His first marriage
ended in divorce in 1973. That same year he and Janet Jeppson were
married at Janet's home by an official of Ethical Culture Society.
Asimov had no children by his second marriage.In 1983 Asimov contracted HIV infection from a tainted blood
transfusion received during a triple bypass surgery. He eventually
developed AIDS and wanted to go public about his AIDS but his doctors
convinced Asimov to remain silent. The specific cause of death was
heart and renal failure as complications of AIDS. He died on April 6,
1992, in Boston, Massachussets, and was cremated. His ashes were
scattered.Ten years after Asimov's death, his widow, Janet Jeppson Asimov,
revealed that his death was a consequence of an unfortunately
contracted AIDS."

Robert_Louis_Stevenson,"Robert Louis Stevenson was a Scottish novelist, poet, and travel writer from Edinburgh. His most popular works include the pirate-themed adventure novel ""Treasure Island"" (1883), the poetry collection ""A Child's Garden of Verses"" (1885), the Gothic horror novella ""Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"" (1886) which depicted a man with two distinct personalities, and the historical novels ""Kidnapped"" (1886) and ""The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Two Roses"" (1888). Stevenson spend the last years of his life in Samoa, where he tried to act as an advocate for the political rights of Polynesians.In 1850, Stevenson was born in Edinburgh. His father was Thomas Stevenson (1818-1887), a civil engineer, lighthouse designer, and meteorologist. Thomas was a co-founder of the Scottish Meteorological Society, and one of the sons of the famed engineer Robert Stevenson (1772-1850). Thomas' brothers were the engineers David Stevenson and Alan Stevenson. Stevenson's mother (and Thomas' wife) was Margaret Isabella Balfour, a member of a centuries-old gentry family. Stevenson's maternal grandfather was Lewis Balfour (1777-1860), a minister of the Church of Scotland. Lewis was himself a grandson of the philosopher James Balfour (1705-1795).Both Stevenson's mother and his maternal grandfather had chronic problems with coughs and fevers. Stevenson demonstrated the same problems throughout his childhood. His contemporaries suspected that he was suffering from tuberculosis. Modern biographers have suggested that he was instead suffering from bronchiectasis (a congenital disorder of the respiratory system) or sarcoidosis (an autoimmune disease which affects the lungs).Stevenson's parents were Presbyterians, but they were not particularly interested in indoctrinating their son. Stevenson's nurse was Alison ""Cummy"" Cunningham, a fervently religious woman. While tending to Stevenson during his recurring illnesses, she read to him passages from the Bible and from the works of the Puritan preacher John Bunyan (1628-1688). She also narrated to him tales of the Covenanters, a 17th-century religious movement.Stevenson's poor health as a child kept him away from school for extended periods. His parents had to hire private tutors for him. He did not learn to read until he was 7 or 8-years-old. However, he developed an interest in narrating stories in early childhood. When he learned to write, he started writing tales as a hobby. His father Thomas was happy about this hobby, as he was also an amateur writer in his early life. In 1866, Stevenson completed his first book. It was ""The Pentland Rising: A Page of History, 1666"", a historical narrative of a Covenanter revolt. It was published at his father's expense.In November 1867, Stevenson entered the University of Edinburgh to study engineering. He showed little interest in the subject matter. He joined both the debating club Speculative Society, and an amateur drama group organized by professor Fleeming Jenkin (1833-1885). During the annual holidays, Stevenson repeatedly joined his father in travels to inspect the family's engineering works. He displayed little interest in engineering, but the travels turned his interests towards travel writing.In April 1871, Stevenson announced to his father that he wanted to become a professional writer. His father agreed, on the condition that Stevenson should also study to gain a law degree. In the early 1870s, Stevenson started dressing in a Bohemian manner, wore his hair long, and joined an atheist club. In January 1873, Stevenson explained to his father that he no longer believed in God, and that he had grown tired of pretending to be pious. He would eventually rejoin Christianity, but remained hostile to organized religion until his death.In late 1873, Stevenson visited London. He had an essay published in the local art magazine ""The Portfolio"" (1870-1893), and started socializing with the city's professional writers. Among his new friends was the poet William Ernest Henley (1849-1903). Henley had a wooden leg, due to a childhood illness which led to amputation. Stevenson later used Henley as his inspiration for the one-legged pirate Long John Silver.Stevenson qualified for the Scottish bar in July 1875, at the age of 24. He never practiced law, though his legal studies inspired aspect of his works. In September 1876, Stevenson was introduced to the American short-story writer Fanny Van de Grift Osbourne (1840-1914). She had separated from her unfaithful husband, and lived with her daughter in France. Fanny remained in his thoughts for months, and they became lovers in 1877. They parted ways in August 1878, when she decided to move back to San Francisco.In August 1879, Stevenson decided to travel to the United States in search of Fanny. He arrived to New York City with little incident. The journey from New York City to California negatively affected his health, and he was near death by the time he arrived in Monterey, California. He and Fanny reunited in December 1879, but she had to nurse him to recovery. His father cabled him money to help in his recovery.Stevenson and Fanny married in May 1880. Th groom was 29-years-old, and the bride was 40-years-old. They spend their honeymoon at an abandoned mining camp on Mount Saint Helena. The couple sailed back to the United Kingdom in August 1880. Fanny helped Stevenson to reconcile with his father.Stevenson and his wife moved frequently from place to place in the early 1880s. In 1884, they settled in their own home in the seaside town of Bournemouth, Dorset. Stevenson named their new residence ""Skerryvore"". He used the name of a lighthouse which his uncle Alan had constructed. In 1885, Stevenson reacquainted himself to his old friend, the novelist Henry James (1843-1916). James had moved to Bournemouth to care for his invalid sister. Stevenson and James started having daily meetings to converse over various topics. Stevenson wrote several of his popular works while living in Bournemouth, though he was frequently bedridden.In 1887, Thomas Stevenson died. Stevenson felt that nothing tied him to the United Kingdom, and his physician had advised him that a complete change of climate might improve his health. Stevenson and much of his surviving family (including his widowed mother) traveled to the state of New York. They spend the winter at a cottage in the Adirondacks, with Stevenson starting to work on the adventure novel ""The Master of Ballantrae"" (1889).In June 1888, Stevenson chartered the yacht ""Casco"" to transport him and his family to San Francisco. The sea air helped restore his health for a while. Stevenson decided to spend the next few years wandering in the Pacific islands. He visited the Hawaiian Islands, and befriended the local monarch Kalakaua (1836-1891, reigned 1874-1891) and his niece Ka'iulani (1875-1899). Stevenson's other voyages took him to the Gilbert Islands, Tahiti, New Zealand and the Samoan Islands.In December 1889, Stevenson and his family at the port of Apia in the Samoan islands. He decided to settle in Samoa. In January 1890, he purchased an estate on the island. He started building Samoa's two-story house, and also started collecting local folktales. He completed an English translation of the moral fable ""The Bottle Imp"".\Stevenson grew concerned with the ongoing rivalry between Britain, Germany and the United States over their influence in Samoa. He feared that the indigenous clan society would be displaced by foreigners. He published various texts in defense of the Polynesians and their culture. He also worked on ""A Footnote to History: Eight Years of Trouble in Samoa"" (1892), a detailed chronicle of the Samoan Civil War (1886-1894) and the international events leading up to it.Stevenson's last fiction writings indicated his growing interest in the realist movement, and his disdain for colonialism. In December 1894, Stevenson suffered a stroke while conversing with his wife. He died hours later, at the age of 44. The local Samoans provided a watch-guard to protect his body until a tomb could be prepared for it. Stevenson was buried at Mount Vaea, on a spot overlooking the sea. A requiem composed by Stevenson himself was inscribed on the tomb.Stevenson was seen as an influential writer of children's literature and horror fiction for much of the 20th century, but literary critics and historians had little interest in his works. He was re-evaluated in the late 20th century ""as an artist of great range and insight"", with scholarly studies devoted entirely to him. The Index Translationum, UNESCO's database of book translations, has ranked him as the 26th most translated writer on a global level. Stevenson ranked below Charles Dickens (25th) in the index, and ahead of Oscar Wilde (28th). His works have received a large number of film adaptations."
Salman_Rushdie,"He married the actress Padma Lakshmi, the hostess of ""Padma's Passport,"" and
dedicatee of his eighth novel, ""Fury"" (2001), on 17th April 2004. The
late Ayatollah Khomeini declared a fatwa against him for the novel ""The
Satanic Verses"" on 14th February 1989. He is currently completing a
ninth novel. Prior to becoming a full time novelist, he enjoyed a
successful advertising career as a copywriter with Ayer Barker in
London until 1982."
Aldous_Huxley,"Aldous Leonard Huxley was born on July 26, 1894, at Laleham in
Godalming, Surrey, England. He was the third of four children. His
brother Julian Huxley was a biologist known for his theories of
evolution. His grandfather, named Thomas Henry Huxley, was a naturalist
known as ""Darwin's Bulldog."" His father, named Leonard Huxley, was a
writer. His mother, named Julia Arnold, was related to poet Matthew
Arnold. Young Huxley graduated from the Hillside School, where his
mother was supervisor. He was traumatized by the death of both his
mother and sister in 1908. He then followed in the footsteps of his
brothers by going to Eaton and then to Balliol College, Oxford
University. At age 16 he contracted keratitis which left him
practically blind for two years, and disqualified him from service in
WWI. Upon his recovery he graduated with a First in English Literature,
he taught English literature at Balliol College, Oxford.Huxley's literary life began in 1915, when he joined the circle of Lady
Ottoline Morell at Garsington Manor. There he met
Bertrand Russell, D.H. Lawrence,
T.S. Eliot,
Lytton Strachey,
Virginia Woolf, and
Katherine Mansfield. He also met and
fell in love with a Belgian refugee Maria Nys. In 1919 she became his
wife, and they had a son, named Matthew. In 1920 Huxley began writing
for Conde Nast at House and Garden to support his family, and later
contributed to Vanity Fair and Vogue magazines. He soon established
himself as a successful writer and social satirist with his novels:
Crome Yellow (1921), Antic Hay (1923), Those Barren Leaves (1925, and
Point Counter Point (1928). The latter novel brought him international
fame and was lated included in the Modern Library list of the top 100
novels of the 20th century.His best known novel
'Brave New World' (1932) was actually preceded by
""We"" (written in 1920, published in English in 1924), which was the
very first anti-Utopian novel in literature, written by Yevgeni Zamyatin.
Both novels describe the futurist idea of One World State, where
totalitarian government manipulates people's lives by eliminating
individual freedom, family, art, literature, religions and cultural
diversity. Totalitarian government controls humans from their
conception and regulates assisted reproduction, as well, as education,
indoctrination, and also enforces the medical drug use for
pacification. Huxley himself called it a ""negative utopia"" which was
written as a parody on
'Men Like Gods' (1923), a Utopian novel by H.G.
Wells, which was also preceded by writings of Yevgeni Zamyatin.In 1937 Huxley moved to Hollywood, California, with wife Maria and a
life-long friend Gerald Heard. There Huxley
befriended Jiddu Krishnamurti and
became one of his disciples, adopting a blend of eastern philosophical
traditions with modernized mysticism. He also joined the circle of
'Swami Prabhavadanta' and became influenced by Vedanta and meditating.
Huxley dramatically updated his lifestyle, become a vegetarian and
practiced yoga. He also experimented with non-addictive psychedelic
drugs and wrote about these experiences extensively. He even reported
that his eyesight had improved for the first time in over 25 years.
After the Second World War Huxley applied for the United States
citizenship, but was denied for refusing to take up arms to defend the
country. He remained a British Citizen for his entire life. Later in
the
1950's he turned down
an offer of a Knight Bachelor by the British government.In 1955 his wife, Maria, died of breast cancer. A year later Huxley
became married to Laura Archera Huxley
who was herself a writer and also became his biographer. In 1960 Huxley
was diagnosed with throat cancer. In his last Utopian novel 'Island'
(1962), Huxley re-visited and updated his basic ideas from the 'Brave
New World' and from his other novels. In 'Island' Huxley summarized his
views on the modern world and society, including his position on
medical drug use and his political stands on democracy, modernity,
ecology and pacifism. The novel served as an inspiration for the 1960's
psychedelic culture and was also incorporated in ideology of the New
Age Movement. Huxley's opposition to the rigid social organization and
self-destructive nature of modern class society and inevitable fatality
of the modern world was paralleled by that of
Jean-Paul Sartre.Aldous Huxley volunteered in experimental drug use in research carried
by his friend Dr. Humphry Osmond since 1953. Huxley repeatedly
experimented with mescaline injections and described his observations
in 'The Doors of Perception' (1954) and 'Heaven and Hell' (1956). His
own health deteriorated dramatically in the early
1960's. Huxley spent
his last days bedridden, almost blind, and unable to speak. On his
deathbed he made a written request to his wife for an intramuscular
injection of 100 mg of LSD. Laura Archera Huxley
followed his instruction, and Huxley died peacefully in a few hours
after the injection. That was on November 22, 1963, in his home in
California. His death was obscured by the news of the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy, which occurred on the same day.Huxley wrote the original screenplay for Disney's animated 'Alise in
Wonderland' (1951), and co-wrote the screenplays for 'Pride and
Prejudice' (1940) and 'Jane Eyre' (1944). Many of his novels were
adapted for film or television: two TV productions of 'Brave New World'
(in 1980 and in 1998), a BBC production of 'Point counterpoint' (1968)
and 'The Devils' (1971) starring Vanessa Redgrave and directed by Ken
Russell, as well as other film and TV adaptations."

Haruki_Murakami,"Haruki Murakami graduated from Waseda University, Tokyo, in 1975.
Widely considered one of Japan's most important 20th-century novelists.
His often solitary, withdrawn, and world-weary protagonists are generally stripped of
Japanese tradition. Frequently called postmodern, his fiction, which
often includes elements of surreal fantasy and is sprinkled with
references to American popular culture, is cool and contemporary; his
distinctive style is often characterized as ""hard-boiled."" His first
novel was Hear the Wind Sing (1979). Since then he has published such
novels as Pinball 1973 (1980), A Wild Sheep Chase (1982), Hard-Boiled
Wonderland and the End of the World (1985), Norwegian Wood (1987),
Dance, Dance, Dance (1988), The Wind-up Bird Chronicle (1995), The
Sputnik Sweetheart (1999), and Kafka on the Shore (2002). He has also
written short stories, e.g., those collected in The Elephant Vanishes
(1993) and After the Quake (2002), and done translations. His first
nonfiction book, Underground (2001), is an oral history of the 1995 gas
attack by religious extremists in the Tokyo subway and its relation to
the Japanese psyche."

Stephen_King,"Stephen Edwin King (born September 21, 1947) is an American author. Widely known for his horror novels, he has been crowned the ""King of Horror"".[2] He has also explored other genres, among them suspense, crime, science-fiction, fantasy and mystery.[3] Though known primarily for his novels, he has written approximately 200 short stories, most of which have been published in collections.[4]

His debut, Carrie (1974), established him in horror. Different Seasons (1982), a collection of four novellas, was his first major departure from the genre. Among the films adapted from King's fiction are Carrie (1976), The Shining (1980), The Dead Zone and Christine (both 1983), Stand by Me (1986), Misery (1990), The Shawshank Redemption (1994), Dolores Claiborne (1995), The Green Mile (1999), The Mist (2007) and It (2017). He has published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman and has co-written works with other authors, notably his friend Peter Straub and sons Joe Hill and Owen King. He has also written nonfiction, notably Danse Macabre (1981) and On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft (2000).

Among other awards, King has won the O. Henry Award for ""The Man in the Black Suit"" (1994) and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Mystery/Thriller for 11/22/63 (2011). He has also won honors for his overall contributions to literature, including the 2003 Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters,[5][6] the 2007 Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America[7] and the 2014 National Medal of Arts.[8] Joyce Carol Oates called King ""a brilliantly rooted, psychologically 'realistic' writer for whom the American scene has been a continuous source of inspiration, and American popular culture a vast cornucopia of possibilities.""[9]

Early life and education
King was born in Portland, Maine, on September 21, 1947. His father, Donald Edwin King, a traveling vacuum salesman after returning from World War II, was born in Indiana with the surname Pollock, changing it to King as an adult.[10] King's mother was Nellie Ruth King (n√©e Pillsbury).[11] His parents were married in Scarborough, Maine, on July 23, 1939. They lived with Donald's family in Chicago before moving to Croton-on-Hudson, New York.[12] King's parents returned to Maine towards the end of World War II, living in a modest house in Scarborough. He is of Scots-Irish descent.[13]

When King was two, his father left the family. His mother raised him and his older brother David by herself, sometimes under great financial strain. They moved from Scarborough and depended on relatives in Chicago, Illinois; Croton-on-Hudson; West De Pere, Wisconsin; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Malden, Massachusetts; and Stratford, Connecticut.[14] When King was 11, his family moved to Durham, Maine, where his mother cared for her parents until their deaths. After that, she became a caregiver in a local residential facility for the mentally challenged.

King says he started writing when he was ""about six or seven, just copying panels out of comic books and then making up my own stories ... Film was also a major influence. I loved the movies from the start. So when I started to write, I had a tendency to write in images because that was all I knew at the time.""[15] Regarding his interest horror, he says ""my childhood was pretty ordinary, except from a very early age, I wanted to be scared. I just did.""[16] He recalls showing his mother a story he copied out of a comic book. She responded: ""I bet you could do better. Write one of your own."" He recalls ""an immense feeling of possibility at the idea, as if I had been ushered into a vast building filled with closed doors and had been given the key to open any I liked.""[17] King was a voracious reader in his youth: ""I read everything from Nancy Drew to Psycho. My favorite was The Shrinking Man, by Richard Matheson‚ÄîI was 8 when I found that.""[18]

King asked a bookmobile driver, ""Do you have any stories about how kids really are?"" She gave him Lord of the Flies. It proved formative: ""It was, so far as I can remember, the first book with hands‚Äîstrong ones that reached out of the pages and seized me by the throat. It said to me, 'This is not just entertainment; it's life or death.'... To me, Lord of the Flies has always represented what novels are for, why they are indispensable.""[19] He attended Durham Elementary School and entered Lisbon High School in Lisbon Falls, Maine, in 1962.[1] He contributed to Dave's Rag, the newspaper his brother printed with a mimeograph machine, and later sold stories to his friends. His first independently published story was ""I Was a Teenage Grave Robber"", serialized over four issues of the fanzine Comics Review in 1965. He was a sports reporter for Lisbon's Weekly Enterprise.

In 1966, King entered the University of Maine at Orono on a scholarship. While there, he wrote for the student newspaper, The Maine Campus, and found mentors in the professors Edward Holmes and Burton Hatlen.[20][21][22] King participated in a writing workshop organized by Hatlen, where he fell in love with Tabitha Spruce.[21] King graduated in 1970 with a Bachelor of Arts in English, and his daughter Naomi Rachel was born that year. King and Spruce wed in 1971.[1] King paid tribute to Hatlen: ""Burt was the greatest English teacher I ever had. It was he who first showed me the way to the pool, which he called 'the language pool, the myth-pool, where we all go down to drink.' That was in 1968. I have trod the path that leads there often in the years since, and I can think of no better place to spend one's days; the water is still sweet, and the fish still swim.""[21]

Career
Beginnings

In 1971, King worked as a teacher at Hampden Academy.
King sold his first professional short story, ""The Glass Floor"", to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967.[1] After graduating from the University of Maine, King earned a certificate to teach high school but was unable to find a teaching post immediately. He sold short stories to magazines like Cavalier. Many of these early stories were republished in Night Shift (1978). In 1971, King was hired as an English teacher at Hampden Academy in Hampden, Maine.[1] He continued to contribute short stories to magazines and worked on ideas for novels, including the anti-war novel Sword in the Darkness, still unpublished.[23]

1970s: Carrie to The Dead Zone

Portrait from the first edition of Carrie (1974)

Portrait from the first edition of The Shining (1977)
King recalls the origin of his debut, Carrie: ""Two unrelated ideas, adolescent cruelty and telekinesis, came together."" It began as a short story intended for Cavalier; King tossed the first three pages in the trash but his wife, Tabitha, recovered them, saying she wanted to know what happened next. She told him: ""You've got something here. I really think you do.""[24] He followed her advice and expanded it into a novel.[25] Per The Guardian, Carrie ""is the story of Carrie White, a high-school student with latent‚Äîand then, as the novel progresses, developing‚Äîtelekinetic powers. It's brutal in places, affecting in others (Carrie's relationship with her almost hysterically religious mother being a particularly damaged one), and gory in even more.""[26] The New York Times noted that ""King does more than tell a story. He is a schoolteacher himself, and he gets into Carrie's mind as well as into the minds of her classmates. He also knows a thing or two about symbolism ‚Äî blood symbolism especially.""[27]

King was teaching Dracula to high school students and wondered what would happen if Old World vampires came to a small New England town. This was the germ of 'Salem's Lot, which King called ""Peyton Place meets Dracula"".[28] King's mother died from uterine cancer around the time 'Salem's Lot was published.[1] After his mother's death, King and his family moved to Boulder, Colorado. He paid a visit to the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park which provided the basis for The Shining, about an alcoholic writer and his family taking care of a hotel for the winter.[15]

King's family returned to Auburn, Maine in 1975, where he completed The Stand, an apocalyptic novel about a pandemic and its aftermath. King recalls that it was the novel that took him the longest to write, and that it was ""also the one my longtime readers still seem to like the best"".[29] In 1977, the Kings, with the addition of Owen Philip, their third and youngest child, traveled briefly to England. They returned to Maine that fall, and King began teaching creative writing at the University of Maine.[1] The courses he taught on horror provided the basis for his first nonfiction book, Danse Macabre. In 1979, he published The Dead Zone, about an ordinary man gifted with second sight. It was the first of his novels to take place in Castle Rock, Maine. King later reflected that with The Dead Zone, ""I really hit my stride.""[30]

1980s: Different Seasons to The Dark Half
In 1982, King published Different Seasons, a collection of four novellas with a more serious dramatic bent than the horror fiction for which he had become famous.[31] Alan Cheuse wrote ""Each of the first three novellas has its hypnotic moments, and the last one is a horrifying little gem.""[32] Three of the four novellas were adapted as films: The Body as Stand by Me (1986);[33] Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption as The Shawshank Redemption (1994);[34] and Apt Pupil as the film of the same name (1998).[35] The fourth, The Breathing Method, won the British Fantasy Award for Best Short Fiction.[36] King recalls ""I got the best reviews in my life. And that was the first time that people thought, woah, this isn't really a horror thing.""[37]

King struggled with addiction throughout the decade and often wrote under the influence of cocaine and alcohol; he says he ""barely remembers writing"" Cujo.[38] In 1983, he published Christine, ""A love triangle involving 17-year-old misfit Arnie Cunningham, his new girlfriend and a haunted 1958 Plymouth Fury.""[39] Later that year, he published Pet Sematary, which he had written in the late 1970s, when his family was living near a highway that ""used up a lot of animals"" as a neighbor put it. His daughter's cat was killed, and they buried it in a pet cemetery built by the local children. King imagined a burial ground beyond it that could raise the dead, albeit imperfectly. He initially found it too disturbing to publish, but resurrected it to fulfill his contract with Doubleday.[40]

In 1985, King published Skeleton Crew, a book of short fiction including ""The Reach"" and The Mist. He recalls: ""I would be asked, 'What happened in your childhood that makes you want to write those terrible things?' I couldn't think of any real answer to that. And I thought to myself, 'Why don't you write a final exam on horror, and put in all the monsters that everyone was afraid of as a kid? Put in Frankenstein, the werewolf, the vampire, the mummy, the giant creatures that ate up New York in the old B movies. Put 'em all in there.""[41] These influences coalesced into It, about a shapeshifting monster that takes the form of its victims' fears and haunts the town of Derry, Maine. He said he thought he was done writing about monsters, and wanted to ""bring on all the monsters one last time‚Ä¶and call it It.""[42] It won the August Derleth Award in 1987.[43]

1987 was an unusually productive year for King. He published The Eyes of the Dragon, a high fantasy novel which he originally wrote for his daughter.[44] He published Misery, about a popular writer who is injured in a car wreck and held captive by Annie Wilkes, his self-described ""number-one fan"". Misery shared the inaugural Bram Stoker Award with Swan Song by Robert R. McCammon.[45] King says the novel was influenced by his experiences with addiction: ""Annie was my drug problem, and she was my number-one fan. God, she never wanted to leave.""[15] He published The Tommyknockers, a science fiction novel filled, he says, with metaphors for addiction. After the book was published, King's wife staged an intervention, and he agreed to seek treatment for addiction.[46] Two years later, he published The Dark Half, about an author whose literary alter-ego takes on a life of his own.[47] In the author's note, King writes that ""I am indebted to the late Richard Bachman.""[48]

1990s: Four Past Midnight to Hearts in Atlantis
In 1990, King published Four Past Midnight, a collection of four novellas with the common theme of time. In 1991, he published Needful Things, his first novel since achieving sobriety, billed as ""The Last Castle Rock Story"".[15] In 1992, he published Gerald's Game and Dolores Claiborne, two novels about women loosely linked by a solar eclipse.[49] The latter novel is narrated by the title character in an unbroken monologue; Mark Singer described it as ""a morally riveting confession from the earthy mouth of a sixty-six-year-old Maine coastal-island native with a granite-hard life but not a grain of self-pity"". King said he based the character of Claiborne on his mother.[22]

In 1994, King's story ""The Man in the Black Suit"" was published in the Halloween issue of The New Yorker.[50] The story went on to win the 1996 O. Henry Award. In 1996, King published The Green Mile, the story of a death row inmate, as a serial novel in six parts. It had the distinction of holding the first, fourth, tenth, twelfth, fourteenth, and fifteenth positions on the New York Times paperback-best-seller list at the same time.[22] In 1998, he published of Bag of Bones, his first book with Scribner, about a recently widowed novelist. Several reviewers said that it showed King's maturation as a writer; Charles de Lint wrote ""He hasn't forsaken the spookiness and scares that have made him a brand name, but he uses them more judiciously now... The present-day King has far more insight into the human condition than did his younger self, and better yet, all the skills required to share it with us.""[51] Bag of Bones won the Bram Stoker and August Derleth Awards.[52][53]

In 1999, he published The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, about a girl who gets lost in the woods and finds solace in listening to broadcasts of Boston Red Sox games, and Hearts in Atlantis, a book of linked novellas and short stories about coming of age in the 1960s. Later that year, King was hospitalized after being hit by the driver of a van. Reflecting on the incident, he said ""it occurs to me that I have nearly been killed by a character out of one of my own novels. It's almost funny."" He said his nurses were ""told in no uncertain terms, don't make any Misery jokes"".[54]

2000s: On Writing to Under the Dome

King at the Harvard Book Store, June 6, 2005

King in 2007
In 2000, King published On Writing, a mix of memoir and style manual which The Wall Street Journal called ""a one-of-a-kind classic"".[55] Later that year he published Riding the Bullet, ""the world's first mass e-book, with more than 500,000 downloads"". Inspired by its success, he began publishing an epistolary horror novel, The Plant, in online installments using the pay what you want method. He suggested readers pay $1 per installment, and said he'd only continue publishing if 75% of readers paid.[56] When The Plant folded, the public assumed that King had abandoned the project because sales were unsuccessful, but King later said he had simply run out of stories.[57] The unfinished novel is still available from King's official site, now free.

In 2002, King published From a Buick 8, a return to the territory of Christine.[58] In 2005, he published the mystery The Colorado Kid for the Hard Case Crime imprint.[59] In 2006, he published Cell, in which a mysterious signal broadcast over cell phones turns users into mindless killers. That same year, he published Lisey's Story, about the widow of a novelist. He calls it his favorite of his novels, because ""I've always felt that marriage creates its own secret world, and only in a long marriage can two people at least approach real knowledge about each other. I wanted to write about that, and felt that I actually got close to what I really wanted to say.""[18] In 2007, King served as guest editor for the annual anthology The Best American Short Stories.[60]

In 2008, King published Duma Key, his first novel set in Florida,[61] and the collection Just After Sunset.[62] In 2009, it was announced he would serve as a writer for Fangoria.[63] King's novel Under the Dome was published later that year, and debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Bestseller List.[64] Janet Maslin said of it, ""Hard as this thing is to hoist, it's even harder to put down.""[65]

2010s: Full Dark, No Stars to The Institute
In 2010, King published Full Dark, No Stars, a collection of four novellas with the common theme of retribution. In 2011, he published 11/22/63, about a time portal leading to 1958, and an English teacher who travels through it to try to prevent the Kennedy assassination. Errol Morris called it ""one of the best time travel stories since H. G. Wells"".[66] In 2013, he published Joyland, his second book for Hard Case Crime.[67] Later that year, he published Doctor Sleep, a sequel to The Shining.

During his Chancellor's Speaker Series talk at University of Massachusetts Lowell on December 7, 2012, King said that he was writing a crime novel about a retired policeman being taunted by a murderer, with the working title Mr. Mercedes.[68] In an interview with Parade, he confirmed that the novel was ""more or less"" completed.[69] It was published in 2014 and won the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Novel.[70] He returned to horror with Revival, which he called ""a nasty, dark piece of work"".[71] King announced in June 2014 that Mr. Mercedes was part of a trilogy; the sequel, Finders Keepers, was published in 2015.[72] The third book of the trilogy, End of Watch, was released in 2016.[73] In 2018, he released The Outsider, which features the character Holly Gibney, and the novella Elevation.[74] In 2019, he released The Institute.

2020s: If It Bleeds to present
In 2020, King released If It Bleeds, a collection of four novellas. In 2021, he published Later, his third book for Hard Case Crime.[75] In 2022, King released the novel Fairy Tale. Holly, about Holly Gibney was released in September 2023.[76] In November 2023, the short story collection You Like It Darker, featuring twelve stories (seven previously published and five unreleased) was published by Scribner in May 2024.[77] The book debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times fiction best-seller list for the week ending May 25, 2024.[78] King announced an upcoming novel named Never Flinch on November 18, 2024. The novel is set to release on May 27, 2025.[79]

Pseudonyms
Main article: Richard Bachman
King published five short novels‚ÄîRage (1977), The Long Walk (1979), Roadwork (1981), The Running Man (1982) and Thinner (1984)‚Äîunder the pseudonym Richard Bachman. He explains: ""I did that because back in the early days of my career there was a feeling in the publishing business that one book a year was all the public would accept...eventually the public got wise to this because you can change your name but you can't really disguise your style.""[80] Bachman's surname is derived from the band Bachman‚ÄìTurner Overdrive and his first name is a nod to Richard Stark, the pseudonym Donald E. Westlake used to publish his darker work.[81] The Bachman books are grittier than King's usual fare; King called his alter-ego ""Dark-toned, despairing...not a very nice guy."" A Literary Guild member praised Thinner as ""what Stephen King would write like if Stephen King could really write.""[22]

Bachman was exposed as King's pseudonym in 1985 by Steve Brown, a Washington, D.C. bookstore clerk who noticed stylistic similarities between King and Bachman and located publisher's records at the Library of Congress that named King as the author of Rage.[82] King announced Bachman's death from ""cancer of the pseudonym"". King reflected that ""Richard Bachman began his career not as a delusion but as a sheltered place where I could publish a few early books which I felt readers might like. Then he began to grow and come alive, as the creatures of a writer's imagination so frequently do... He took on his own reality, that's all, and when his cover was blown, he died.""[83] Originally, King planned Misery to be released under the pseudonym before his identity was discovered.[84]

When Desperation (1996) was released, the companion novel The Regulators was published as a ""discovered manuscript"" by Bachman. In 2006, King announced that he had discovered another Bachman novel, Blaze, which was published the following year. The original manuscript had been held at the University of Maine for many years and had been covered by numerous King experts. King rewrote the original 1973 manuscript for its publication.[85]

King has used other pseudonyms. In 1972, the short story ""The Fifth Quarter"" was published under the name John Swithen (a Carrie character) in Cavalier.[86] Charlie the Choo-Choo: From the World of The Dark Tower was published in 2016 under the pseudonym Beryl Evans and illustrated by Ned Dameron.[87] It is adapted from a fictional book central to the plot of King's The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands.[88]

The Dark Tower
Main article: The Dark Tower (series)
In the late 1970s, King began a series about a lone gunslinger, Roland, who pursues the ""Man in Black"" in an alternate universe that is a cross between J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth and the American Wild West as depicted by Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone in their spaghetti Westerns. The first story, The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger, was initially published in five installments in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction under the editorship of Edward L. Ferman, from 1977 to 1981. It grew into an eight-volume epic, The Dark Tower, published between 1978 and 2012.

Collaborations
Literature
King co-wrote two novels with Peter Straub, The Talisman (1984) and Black House (2001).[89] Straub recalls that ""We tried to make it as difficult as possible for readers to identify who wrote what. Eventually, we were able to successfully imitate each other's style... Steve threw in more commas or clauses, and I kind of made things more simple in sentence structure. And I tried to make things as vivid as I could because Steve is just fabulous at that, and also I tried to write more colloquially."" Straub said the only person who could correctly identify who wrote which passages was a fellow author, Neil Gaiman.[90]

King and the photographer f-stop Fitzgerald collaborated on the coffee table book Nightmares in the Sky: Gargoyles and Grotesques (1988).[91] He produced an artist's book with designer Barbara Kruger, My Pretty Pony (1989), published in a limited edition of 250 by the Library Fellows of the Whitney Museum of American Art. Alfred A. Knopf released it in a general trade edition.[92]

King co-wrote Throttle (2009) with his son Joe Hill. The novella is an homage to Richard Matheson's ""Duel"".[93] Their second collaboration, In the Tall Grass (2012), was published in two parts in Esquire.[94][95] King and his son Owen co-wrote Sleeping Beauties (2018), set in a West Virginia women's prison.[96] King and Richard Chizmar co-wrote Gwendy's Button Box (2017).[97] A sequel, Gwendy's Magic Feather (2019), was a solo effort by Chizmar.[98] In 2022, King and Chizmar rejoined forces for Gwendy's Final Task.[99]

Film and television
King made his screenwriting debut with George A. Romero's Creepshow (1982), a tribute to EC horror comics. In 1985, he wrote another horror anthology film, Cat's Eye. Rob Reiner, whose film Stand by Me (1986) is an adaptation of King's novella The Body, named his production company Castle Rock Entertainment after King's fictional town.[100] Castle Rock Entertainment would produce other King adaptations, including Reiner's Misery (1990) and Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption (1994).

In 1986, King made his directorial debut with Maximum Overdrive, an adaptation of his story ""Trucks"". He recalls: ""I was coked out of my mind all through its production, and really didn't know what I was doing.""[101] It was neither a critical nor a commercial success; King was nominated for a Golden Raspberry for Worst Director, but lost to Prince, for Under the Cherry Moon.[102]

In the 1990s, King wrote several miniseries: Golden Years (1991), The Stand (1994), The Shining (1997) and Storm of the Century (1999).[103] He wrote the miniseries Rose Red (2002); The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red (2001) was written by Ridley Pearson and published anonymously as a tie-in for the series. He also developed Kingdom Hospital (2004), based on Lars von Trier's The Kingdom.

Music and theater
King collaborated with Stan Winston and Mick Garris on the music video Michael Jackson's Ghosts (1996).[104] He co-wrote the musical Ghost Brothers of Darkland County (2012) with T. Bone Burnett and John Mellencamp.[105] A soundtrack album was released, featuring Taj Mahal, Elvis Costello and Rosanne Cash, among others.[106]

Comics
In 1985, King wrote a few pages of the benefit X-Men comic book Heroes for Hope Starring the X-Men.[107] He wrote the introduction to Batman No. 400, an anniversary issue where he expressed his preference for the character over Superman.[108] In 2010, DC Comics premiered American Vampire, a comic book series co-written by King and Scott Snyder and illustrated by Rafael Albuquerque.[109] King wrote the backstory of the first American vampire, Skinner Sweet, in the first five-issues story arc.[110]

Style, themes and influences
Style

King in 2011
In On Writing, King recalls:

When, during the course of an interview for The New Yorker, I told the interviewer (Mark Singer) that I believed stories are found things, like fossils in the ground, he said that he didn't believe me. I replied that that was fine, as long as he believed that I believe it. And I do. Stories aren't souvenir tee-shirts or GameBoys. Stories are relics, part of an undiscovered pre-existing world. The writer's job is to use the tools in his or her toolbox to get as much of each one out of the ground intact as possible. Sometimes the fossil you uncover is small, a seashell. Sometimes it's enormous, a Tyrannosaurus Rex with all those gigantic ribs and grinning teeth. Either way, short story or thousand-page whopper of a novel, the techniques of excavation remain basically the same.[111]

King often starts with a ""what-if"" scenario, asking what would happen if an alcoholic writer was stranded with his family in a haunted hotel (The Shining), or if one could see the outcome of future events (The Dead Zone), or if one could travel in time to alter the course of history (11/22/63).[112] He writes that ""The situation comes first. The characters‚Äîalways flat and unfeatured, to begin with‚Äîcome next. Once these things are fixed in my mind, I begin to narrate. I often have an idea of what the outcome may be, but I have never demanded a set of characters that they do things my way. On the contrary, I want them to do things their way. In some instances, the outcome is what I visualized. In most, however, it's something I never expected.""[113]

Joyce Carol Oates called King ""both a storyteller and an inventor of startling images and metaphors, which linger long in the memory.""[9] An example of King's imagery is seen in The Body when the narrator recalls a childhood clubhouse with a tin roof and rusty screen door: ""No matter what time of day you looked out that screen door, it looked like sunset... When it rained, being inside the club was like being inside a Jamaican steel drum.""[114] King writes that ""The use of simile and other figurative language is one of the chief delights of fiction‚Äîreading it and writing it, as well. [...] By comparing two seemingly unrelated objects‚Äîa restaurant bar and a cave, a mirror and a mirage‚Äîwe are sometimes able to see an old thing in a new and vivid way. Even if the result is mere clarity instead of beauty, I think writer and reader are participating together in a kind of miracle. Maybe that's drawing it a little strong, but yeah‚Äîit's what I believe.""[115]

Themes
When asked if fear was his main subject, King said ""In every life you get to a point where you have to deal with something that's inexplicable to you, whether it's the doctor saying you have cancer or a prank phone call. So whether you talk about ghosts or vampires or Nazi war criminals living down the block, we're still talking about the same thing, which is an intrusion of the extraordinary into ordinary life and how we deal with it. What that shows about our character and our interactions with others and the society we live in interests me a lot more than monsters and vampires and ghouls and ghosts.""[15]

Joyce Carol Oates said that ""Stephen King's characteristic subject is small-town American life, often set in fictitious Derry, Maine; tales of family life, marital life, the lives of children banded together by age, circumstance, and urgency, where parents prove oblivious or helpless. The human heart in conflict with itself‚Äîin the guise of the malevolent Other. The 'gothic' imagination magnifies the vicissitudes of 'real life' in order to bring it into a sharper and clearer focus.""[9] King's The Body is about coming of age, a theme he has returned to several times, for example in Joyland.[116]

King often uses authors as characters, such as Ben Mears in 'Salem's Lot, Jack Torrance in The Shining, adult Bill Denbrough in It and Mike Noonan in Bag of Bones. He has extended this to breaking the fourth wall by including himself as a character in three novels of The Dark Tower. Among other things, this allows King to explore themes of authorship; George Stade writes that Misery ""is a parable in chiller form of the popular writer's relation to his audience, which holds him prisoner and dictates what he writes, on pain of death"" while The Dark Half ""is a parable in chiller form of the popular writer's relation to his creative genius, the vampire within him, the part of him that only awakes to raise Cain when he writes.""[117]

Introducing King at the National Book Awards, Walter Mosley said ""Stephen King once said that daily life is the frame that makes the picture. His commitment, as I see it, is to celebrate and empower the everyday man and woman as they buy aspirin and cope with cancer. He takes our daily lives and makes them into something heroic. He takes our world, validates our distrust of it and then helps us to see that there's a chance to transcend the muck. He tells us that even if we fail in our struggles, we are still worthy enough to pass on our energies in the survival of humanity.""[6] In his acceptance speech for the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, King said:

""Frank Norris, the author of McTeague, said something like this: 'What should I care if they, i.e., the critics, single me out for sneers and laughter? I never truckled, I never lied. I told the truth.' And that's always been the bottom line for me. The story and the people in it may be make believe but I need to ask myself over and over if I've told the truth about the way real people would behave in a similar situation... We understand that fiction is a lie to begin with. To ignore the truth inside the lie is to sin against the craft, in general, and one's own work in particular.""[6]

Influences
In On Writing, King says ""If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all: read a lot and write a lot.""[118] He emphasizes the importance of good description, which ""begins with clear seeing and ends with clear writing, the kind of writing that employs fresh images and simple vocabulary. I began learning my lessons in this regard by reading Chandler, Hammett, and Ross Macdonald; I gained perhaps even more respect for the power of compact, descriptive language from reading T. S. Eliot (those ragged claws scuttling across the ocean floor; those coffee spoons), and William Carlos Williams (white chickens, red wheelbarrow, the plums that were in the ice box, so sweet and so cold).""[119]

King has called Richard Matheson ""the author who influenced me most"".[120] Other influences include Ray Bradbury,[121] Joseph Payne Brennan,[122] James M. Cain,[123] Jack Finney,[124] Graham Greene,[15] Elmore Leonard,[125] John D. MacDonald,[126] Don Robertson[127] and Thomas Williams.[128] He often pays homage to classic horror stories by retelling them in a modern context. He recalls that while writing 'Salem's Lot, ""I decided I wanted to try to use the book partially as a form of literary homage (as Peter Straub had done in Ghost Story, working in the tradition of such 'classical' ghost story writers as Henry James, M. R. James, and Nathaniel Hawthorne). So my novel bears an intentional similarity to Bram Stoker's Dracula, and after a while it began to seem I was playing an interesting‚Äîto me, at least‚Äîgame of literary racquet-ball: 'Salem's Lot itself was the ball and Dracula was the wall I kept hitting it against, watching to see how and where it could bounce, so I could hit it again. As a matter of fact, it took some pretty interesting bounces, and I ascribe this mostly to the fact that, while my ball existed in the twentieth century, the wall was very much a product of the nineteenth.""[129] Similarly, King's Revival is a modern riff on Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.[130] King dedicated it to ""the people who built my house"": Shelley, Stoker, H. P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, Donald Wandrei, Fritz Leiber, August Derleth, Shirley Jackson, Robert Bloch, Straub and Arthur Machen, ""whose short novel The Great God Pan has haunted me all my life"".[131]

He provided an appreciation for The Golden Argosy, a collection of short stories featuring Cather, Hemingway, Faulkner, Fitzgerald and others: ""I first found The Golden Argosy in a Lisbon Falls (Maine) bargain barn called the Jolly White Elephant, where it was on offer for $2.25. At that time I only had four dollars, and spending over half of it on one book, even a hardcover, was a tough decision. I've never regretted it... The Golden Argosy taught me more about good writing than all the writing classes I've ever taken. It was the best $2.25 I ever spent.""[132]

Reception and influence
Critical reception
King has been praised for his use of realistic detail. In A Century of Great Suspense Stories, editor Jeffery Deaver wrote that ""While there were many good best-selling writers before him, King, more than anybody since John D. MacDonald, brought reality to genre novels. He has often remarked that 'Salem's Lot was 'Peyton Place meets Dracula'. And so it was. The rich characterization, the careful and caring social eye, the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again. Before King, many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious blue-penciled by their editors. 'Stuff like that gets in the way of the story,' they were told. Well, it's stuff like that that has made King so popular, and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing. He is a master of masters.""[28] Daniel Mendelsohn, reviewing Bag of Bones, wrote that ""Stephen King is so widely accepted as America's master of paranormal terrors that you can forget his real genius is for the everyday... This is a book about reanimation: the ghosts', of course, but also Mike's, his desire to re-embrace love and work after a long bereavement that King depicts with an eye for the kind of small but moving details that don't typically distinguish blockbuster horror novels.""[133]

Many critics argue that King has matured as a writer. In his analysis of post‚ÄìWorld War II horror fiction, The Modern Weird Tale (2001), S. T. Joshi devotes a chapter to King's work. Joshi argues that King's best-known works are his worst, describing them as mostly bloated, illogical, maudlin and prone to deus ex machina endings. Despite these criticisms, Joshi argues that since Gerald's Game (1992), King has been tempering the worst of his writing faults, producing books that are leaner, more believable and generally better written.[134]

In 2003, King was honored by the National Book Awards with a lifetime achievement award, the Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. Some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award: Richard E. Snyder, the former CEO of Simon & Schuster, described King's work as ""non-literature"" and critic Harold Bloom denounced the choice: ""The decision to give the National Book Foundation's annual award for 'distinguished contribution' to Stephen King is extraordinary, another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life. I've described King in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls, but perhaps even that is too kind. He shares nothing with Edgar Allan Poe. What he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis.""[135]

King acknowledged the controversy in his acceptance speech: ""There are some people who have spoken out passionately about giving me this medal. There are some people who think it's an extraordinarily bad idea. There have been some people who have spoken out who think it's an extraordinarily good idea. You know who you are and where you stand and most of you who are here tonight are on my side. I'm glad for that. But I want to say it doesn't matter in a sense which side you were on. The people who speak out, speak out because they are passionate about the book, about the word, about the page and, in that sense, we're all brothers and sisters. Give yourself a hand.""[6] Shirley Hazzard, whose novel The Great Fire was that year's National Book Award winner, responded by criticising King; she later said that she had never read him.[136]

Roger Ebert wrote that ""A lot people were outraged when he was honored at the National Book Awards, as if a popular writer couldn't be taken seriously. But after finding that his book On Writing has more useful and observant things to say about the craft than any book since Strunk and White's The Elements of Style, I have gotten over my own snobbery. King has, after all, been responsible for the movies The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, The Dead Zone, Misery, Apt Pupil, Christine, Hearts in Atlantis, Stand By Me and Carrie... And we must not be ungrateful for Silver Bullet, which I awarded three stars because it was 'either the worst movie made from a Stephen King story, or the funniest', and you know which side of that I'm gonna come down on.""[137]

Appraisal by other authors
Cynthia Ozick said that, upon giving a reading with King, ""It dawned on me as I listened to him that, never mind all the best sellers and all the stereotypes -- this man is a genuine, true-born writer, and that was a revelation. He is not Tom Clancy. He writes sentences, and he has a literary focus, and his writing is filled with literary history. It's not glib, it's not just contemporary chatter and it's not stupid -- that's a bad way to say that something's smart, but that's what I mean.""[56]

Joyce Carol Oates praised King's sense of place: ""His fiction is famously saturated with the atmosphere of Maine; much of his mostly vividly imagined work‚ÄîSalem's Lot, Dolores Claiborne, the elegantly composed story 'The Reach', for instance‚Äîis a poetic evocation of that landscape, its history and its inhabitants.""[9] Oates included the latter story in the second edition of The Oxford Book of American Short Stories.[138]

Peter Straub compared King favorably to Charles Dickens: ""Both are novelists of vast popularity and enormous bibliographies, both are beloved writers with a pronounced taste for the morbid and grotesque, both display a deep interest in the underclass.""[139] Straub included King's short story ""That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French"" in the Library of America anthology American Fantastic Tales.[140]

David Foster Wallace assigned Carrie and The Stand while teaching at Illinois State University. Wallace praised King's ear for dialogue: ""He's one of the first people to talk about real Americans and how they live, to capture real American dialogue in all its, like, foulmouthed grandeur... He has a deadly ear for the way people speak... Students come to me and a lot of them have been led to believe that there's good stuff and bad stuff, literary books and popular books, stuff that's redemptive and commercial shit‚Äîwith a sharp line drawn between the two categories. It's good to show them that there's a certain amount of blurring. Surface-wise, King's work is a bit televisual, but there's really a lot going on.""[22]

Influence
In an interview, Sherman Alexie recalls the influence of ""Stephen King, who was always writing about underdogs, and bullied kids, and kids fighting back against overwhelming, often supernatural forces... The world aligned against them. As an Indian boy growing up on a reservation, I always identified with his protagonists. Stephen King, fighting the monsters.""[141]

Lauren Groff says that ""I love Stephen King and I owe him more than I could ever express... I love his wild imagination and his vivid scenes, many of which populate my nightmares even decades after I last read the books they're in. But the greatest thing I gleaned most from reading Stephen King is his big-hearted glee, the way he treats writing with gratitude, the way he sees his job not as the source of anguish and pain many writers self-pityingly see it as, but rather as something he's over-the-moon delighted to be lucky enough to do. If I could steal one thing from King, and keep it close to my heart forever, it is his sense of almost-holy glee when it comes to writing.""[142]

The hero of Junot D√≠az's The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao dreams of being ""the Dominican Stephen King"", and D√≠az alludes to King's work several times throughout the novel.[143] Colson Whitehead recalls that ""The first big book I read was Night Shift by Stephen King, you know, a huge book of short stories. And so for many years I just wanted to write horror fiction.""[144] In a talk at Virginia Commonwealth University, Whitehead recalls that in college ""I wanted to write the black Shining or the black Salem's Lot... Take any Stephen King title and put 'the black' in front of it. That's basically what I wanted to do.""[145]

Views and activism

King campaigning for Gary Hart in 1984
King was raised Methodist,[146][147] but lost his belief in organized religion while in high school. While not conventionally religious, he says he does believe in God.[148] In 1984, King endorsed Gary Hart's presidential campaign.[149] In April 2008, King spoke out against HB 1423, a bill pending in the Massachusetts state legislature that would restrict or ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under the age of 18. King argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor and the easy availability of guns, which he believed were the actual causes of violence.[150]


King at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany, 2013
During the 2008 presidential election, King endorsed Barack Obama.[151] On March 8, 2011, King spoke at a political rally in Sarasota aimed against Governor Rick Scott (R-FL), voicing his opposition to the Tea Party movement.[152] On April 30, 2012, King published an article in The Daily Beast calling for rich Americans, including himself, to pay more taxes, citing it as ""a practical necessity and moral imperative that those who have received much should be obligated to pay ... in the same proportion"".[153]

On January 25, 2013, King published an essay titled Guns via Amazon.com's Kindle single feature, which discusses the gun debate in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. King called for gun owners to support a ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons, writing, ""Autos and semi-autos are weapons of mass destruction...When lunatics want to make war on the unarmed and unprepared, these are the weapons they use.""[154][155] The essay became the fifth-bestselling nonfiction title for the Kindle.[156]

In 2016, King was one of many writers who signed a letter condemning the candidacy of Donald Trump. It began: ""Because, as writers, we are particularly aware of the many ways that language can be abused in the name of power"" and concluded ""Because the rise of a political candidate who deliberately appeals to the basest and most violent elements in society, who encourages aggression among his followers, shouts down opponents, intimidates dissenters, and denigrates women and minorities, demands, from each of us, an immediate and forceful response; For all these reasons, we, the undersigned, as a matter of conscience, oppose, unequivocally, the candidacy of Donald J. Trump for the Presidency of the United States.""[157]

King criticized former Iowa Rep. Steve King, deeming him a racist and saying he was tired of being confused with him.[158] In June 2018, King called for the release of the Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov, who was jailed in Russia.[159] In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, King endorsed Elizabeth Warren's campaign.[160] Warren eventually suspended her campaign, and King later endorsed Joe Biden's campaign in the 2020 general election.[161] In 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, King expressed support for Ukraine. On his Twitter account,[162][163] King posted a photo in an ""I stand with Ukraine"" T-shirt and later tweeted that he refuses to cooperate with Russian publishers.[164][165]

In July 2022, Stephen King appeared in a video call with the Russian pranksters Vovan and Lexus who played the role of Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In the call Stephen King said ""You can always find things about people to pull them down. Washington and Jefferson were slave owners‚Äîthat doesn't mean they didn't do many good things to the United States of America. There are always people who have flaws, we are humans. On the whole, I think Bandera is a great man, and you're a great man, and Viva Ukraine!""[166] However, King later realized that he was pranked and apologized on Twitter, noting that he was not the only victim and ""other victims who fell for these guys include J. K. Rowling, Prince Harry, and Justin Trudeau"".[167]

King testified in an August 2022 case brought by the U.S. Justice Department to block a $2.2 billion merger of Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster (two of the ""Big Five"" book publishers). The New York Times credited King's high-profile testimony, which was against his own publisher, with helping to convince presiding judge Florence Y. Pan with ultimately blocking the merger.[168]

King called on Joe Biden to step down from the presidential race: ‚ÄúJoe Biden has been a fine president, but it‚Äôs time for him ‚Äî in the interests of the America he so clearly loves ‚Äî to announce he will not run for re-election.‚Äù[169] King went on to endorse Kamala Harris.[170]

Maine politics
King endorsed Shenna Bellows in the 2014 U.S. Senate election for the seat held by Republican Susan Collins.[171] King publicly criticized Paul LePage during LePage's tenure as Governor of Maine, referring to him as one of The Three Stooges (with then-Florida Governor Rick Scott and then-Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker being the other two).[152] He was critical of LePage for incorrectly suggesting in a 2015 radio address that King avoided paying Maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year. The statement was later corrected by the governor's office, but no apology was issued. King said LePage was ""full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green""[172] and demanded that LePage ""man up and apologize"".[173] LePage declined to apologize to King, stating, ""I never said Stephen King did not pay income taxes. What I said was, Stephen King's not in Maine right now. That's what I said.""[174]

The attention garnered by the LePage criticism led to efforts to encourage King to run for Governor of Maine in 2018.[175] King said he would not run or serve.[176] King sent a tweet on June 30, 2015, calling LePage ""a terrible embarrassment to the state I live in and love. If he won't govern, he should resign."" He later clarified that he was not calling on LePage to resign, but to ""go to work or go back home"".[177] On August 27, 2016, King called LePage ""a bigot, a homophobe, and a racist"".[178]

Philanthropy
King subsidizes the National Poetry Foundation, which was directed by his professor and mentor Burton Hatlen, and has endowed scholarships named for another professor, Edward Holmes. Mark Singer also notes Bangor's ""most monumental testament to King's philanthropy"", the ""Shawn T. Mansfield Baseball Complex, dedicated six years ago in memory of the son of a Little League coach and friend of King's who died at fourteen of cerebral palsy.""[22] King has stated that he donates approximately $4 million per year ""to libraries, local fire departments that need updated lifesaving equipment (Jaws of Life tools are always a popular request), schools, and a scattering of organisations that underwrite the arts"".[153][179] The Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation, chaired by King and his wife, ranks sixth among Maine charities in terms of average annual giving, with over $2.8 million in grants per year, according to The Grantsmanship Center.[180]

In 2002, King, Peter Straub, John Grisham and Pat Conroy organized the Wavedancer Benefit, a public reading to raise funds for the actor and audiobook reader Frank Muller, who had been injured in a motorcycle accident.[181] Their reading was released as an audiobook.[182] In November 2011, the STK Foundation donated $70,000 in matched funding via his radio station to help pay the heating bills for families in need in his hometown of Bangor, Maine, during the winter.[183] In February 2021, King's Foundation donated $6,500 to help children from the Farwell Elementary School in Lewiston, Maine, to publish two novels on which they had been working over the course of several prior years, before being stopped due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Maine.[184]

Personal life

King's home in Bangor
After meeting while studying at the University of Maine,[185] King married Tabitha Spruce on January 2, 1971.[186] She is also a novelist and philanthropist. She has been supportive of him throughout his career, even rescuing his early manuscript of Carrie from the trash when he doubted himself.[185] They own and divide their time between three houses: one in Bangor, Maine, one in Lovell, Maine, and for the winter a waterfront mansion located off the Gulf of Mexico in Sarasota, Florida. King's home in Bangor has been described as an unofficial tourist attraction, and as of 2019, the couple plan to convert it into a facility housing his archives and a writers' retreat.[187]


Portrait of Owen and Stephen from the first edition of Different Seasons (1982)
The Kings have three children‚Äîtwo sons and a daughter, Naomi (born June 1, 1970), who is a Unitarian Universalist Church minister in Plantation, Florida, with their partner, Thandeka.[188] Both of King's sons are also professional authors: Owen King (born February 21, 1977)[185] published his first collection of stories, We're All in This Together: A Novella and Stories, in 2005. Joseph Hillstr√∂m King (born June 4, 1972),[185] who writes as Joe Hill, published his first collection of short stories, 20th Century Ghosts, in 2005.[189]


King wearing a Boston Red Sox jersey at a book signing in November 2004
King is a longtime fan of baseball, particularly the Boston Red Sox. In 1990, King published an essay about Owen's Little League team in The New Yorker.[190] King and Stewart O'Nan coauthored Faithful, a chronicle of their correspondence about the historic 2004 Boston Red Sox season which culminated in the Sox winning the 2004 World Series.[191] The game features in King's novellas The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon (1999) and Blockade Billy (2010).

Music, particularly rock, plays a role in much of King's work. On the BBC program Desert Island Discs, King's number one choice was Bob Dylan's ""Desolation Row"".[192] On another BBC program, Paperback Writers, he made new selections, among them AC/DC's ""Stiff Upper Lip"", Danny & the Juniors's ""At the Hop"" and Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""It Came Out of the Sky"".[193] He played guitar for the Rock Bottom Remainders, a charity supergroup whose members included Amy Tan, Barbara Kingsolver, Dave Barry, Scott Turow, James McBride, Mitch Albom, Roy Blount, Jr., Matt Groening, Greg Iles, Kathi Kamen Goldmark and other authors. They released an album, Stranger Than Fiction (1998), under Goldmark's label, Don't Quit Your Day Job Records.[194] King and his band-mates coauthored Midlife Confidential: The Rock Bottom Remainders Tour America With Three Chords and an Attitude (1994) and the e-book Hard Listening: The Greatest Rock Band Ever (of Authors) Tells All (2013).[195] King's favorite books about music are Greil Marcus's Mystery Train and Lipstick Traces and Chris Willman's Rednecks and Bluenecks.[18]

King and his wife own the Zone Corporation, a radio station group established in 1983 to acquire WACZ in Bangor, which was renamed WZON.[196][197] Two additional stations, WKIT-FM and WNSW in Brewer, were added in 1995;[198] WNSW was quickly closed down.[199] A third station, WDME-FM in Dover-Foxcroft (later renamed WZLO), was acquired in 2001.[200] In December 2024, King announced that the stations would shut down at the end of the year. He cited his advancing age and financial losses from the stations as reasons for the closure.[201] Ahead of the planned closure, King reached a deal to sell WKIT to two Bangor businessmen; WZON and WZLO remain slated for closure.[202]

King remains a voracious reader. In J. Peder Zane's The Top Ten: Authors Pick Their Favorite Books, King chose The Golden Argosy, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Satanic Verses, McTeague, Lord of the Flies, Bleak House, Nineteen Eighty-Four, The Raj Quartet, Light in August and Blood Meridian. In 2022, he provided another list of ten favorite books; Lord of the Flies, Nineteen Eighty-Four and Blood Meridian remained, and he added Ship of Fools, The Orphan Master's Son, Invisible Man, Watership Down, The Hair of Harold Roux, American Pastoral and The Lord of the Rings. He added, ""Although Anthony Powell's novels should probably be on here, especially the sublimely titled Casanova's Chinese Restaurant and Books Do Furnish a Room. And Paul Scott's Raj Quartet. And at least six novels by Patricia Highsmith. And what about Patrick O'Brian? See how hard this is to do?""[203]

When asked about his reading habits, King replied, ""I'm sort of an omnivore, apt to go from the latest John Sandford to D. H. Lawrence to Cormac McCarthy."" When asked what books we'd be surprised to find on his shelves, he answered ""Poetry, maybe? I love Anne Sexton, Richard Wilbur, W. B. Yeats. The poetry I come back to again and again are the narrative poems of Stephen Dobyns."" When asked which novel he comes back to, he named Thomas Williams's The Hair of Harold Roux. When asked who his favorite novelist is, he said ""Probably Don Robertson, author of Paradise Falls, The Ideal, Genuine Man and the marvelously titled Miss Margaret Ridpath and the Dismantling of the Universe. What I appreciate most in novels and novelists is generosity, a complete baring of the heart and mind, and Robertson always did that. He also wrote the best single line I've ever read in a novel: Of a funeral he wrote, 'There were that day, o Lord, squadrons of birds.'""[18]

Car accident and aftermath
On June 19, 1999, at about 4:30 p.m., King was walking on the shoulder of Maine State Route 5, in Lovell, Maine. Driver Bryan Edwin Smith, distracted by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan, struck King, who landed in a depression in the ground about 14 feet (four meters) from the pavement of Route 5.[204]:‚Ää206‚Ää Early reports at the time from Oxford County Sheriff deputy Matt Baker claimed King was hit from behind, and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding, reckless, or drinking.[205]

However, Smith was later arrested and charged with driving to endanger and aggravated assault. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of driving to endanger and was sentenced to six months in county jail (suspended) and had his driving license suspended for a year.[206] In his book On Writing, King states he was heading north, walking against the traffic. Shortly before the accident took place, a woman in a car, also northbound, passed King first followed by a light blue Dodge van. The van was looping from one side of the road to the other, and the woman told her passenger she hoped ""that guy in the van doesn't hit him"".[204]:‚Ää206‚Ää

King was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family but was in considerable pain. He was transported to Northern Cumberland Hospital in Bridgton and then flown by air ambulance to Central Maine Medical Center (CMMC) in Lewiston. His injuries‚Äîa collapsed right lung, multiple fractures of his right leg, scalp laceration and a broken hip‚Äîkept him at CMMC until July 9. His leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg but stabilized the bones in the leg with an external fixator.[207] After five operations in 10 days and physical therapy, King resumed work on On Writing in July, though his hip was still shattered and he could sit for only about 40 minutes before the pain became unbearable.[204]:‚Ää216‚Ää

King's wife got in touch with his lawyer to purchase Smith's van, reportedly to prevent it from appearing on eBay. He recalls: ""When I was in the hospital, mostly unconscious; my wife got a lawyer who's just a friend of the family...And she got in touch with him and said, buy it so that somebody else doesn't buy it and decide to break it up and sell it on eBay, on the Internet. And so he did. And for about six months, I did have these, sort of, fantasies of smashing the van up. But my wife ‚Äì I don't always listen to her the first time, but sooner or later, she usually gets through. And what she says makes more sense than what I had planned. And her thought was that the best thing to do would be to very quietly remove it from this plane of existence, which is what we did.""[54]

Appearances in other media
In The Princess Bride, William Goldman writes that Stephen King is ""doing the abridgment"" of the fictional book Buttercup's Baby.[208] King explains this is an inside joke from Goldman, ""who's an old friend. He's done the screen adaptations for a number of my novels. He did Misery, Dreamcatcher and he also did Hearts in Atlantis, and although he's not credited, he worked on Dolores Claiborne as well, so Bill and I go back a long way. I admired his books before I ever met him and as a kind of return tip of the cap, he put me in that book The Princess Bride.""[147]

In 1988, the band Blue √ñyster Cult recorded an updated version of its 1974 song ""Astronomy""; the single released for radio play featured a narrative intro spoken by King.[209] In 2012, King provided the narration for Shooter Jennings's album Black Ribbons.[210] King was a contestant on Celebrity Jeopardy! in 1995 and 1998.[211] He's made cameos in adaptations of his work, and appeared as the character Bachman on Sons of Anarchy; the name is a nod to his pseudonym Richard Bachman.[212] He voiced himself in The Simpsons episode ""Insane Clown Poppy"", where he appears with fellow authors Amy Tan, John Updike and Tom Wolfe at a book fair. King tells Marge he is taking a break from horror to write a biography of Benjamin Franklin.[213]

O_Henry,"William Sydney Porter (September 11, 1862 ‚Äì June 5, 1910), better known by his pen name O. Henry, was an American writer known primarily for his short stories, though he also wrote poetry and non-fiction. His works include ""The Gift of the Magi"", ""The Duplicity of Hargraves"", and ""The Ransom of Red Chief"", as well as the novel Cabbages and Kings. Porter's stories are known for their naturalist observations, witty narration, and surprise endings.

Born in Greensboro, North Carolina, Porter worked at his uncle's pharmacy after finishing school and became a licensed pharmacist at age 19. In March 1882, he moved to Texas, where he initially lived on a ranch, and later settled in Austin, where he met his first wife, Athol Estes. While working as a drafter for the Texas General Land Office, Porter began developing characters for his short stories. He later worked for the First National Bank of Austin, while also publishing a weekly periodical, The Rolling Stone.

In 1895, he was charged with embezzlement stemming from an audit of the bank. Before the trial, he fled to Honduras, where he began writing Cabbages and Kings (in which he coined the term ""banana republic""). Porter surrendered to U.S. authorities when he learned his wife was dying from tuberculosis, and he cared for her until her death in July 1897. He began his five-year prison sentence in March 1898 at the Ohio Penitentiary, where he served as a night druggist. While imprisoned, Porter published 14 stories under various pseudonyms, one being O. Henry.

Released from prison early for good behavior, Porter moved to Pittsburgh to be with his daughter Margaret before relocating to New York City, where he wrote 381 short stories. He married Sarah (Sallie) Lindsey Coleman in 1907; she left him two years later. Porter died on June 5, 1910, after years of deteriorating health. Porter's legacy includes the O. Henry Award, an annual prize awarded to outstanding short stories.

Early life
William Sidney Porter was born on September 11, 1862, in Greensboro, North Carolina, during the American Civil War. He changed the spelling of his middle name to Sydney in 1898. His parents were Algernon Sidney Porter (1825‚Äì88), a physician, and Mary Jane Virginia Swaim Porter (1833‚Äì65). William's parents had married on April 20, 1858. When William was three, his mother died after giving birth to her third child, and he and his father moved into the home of his paternal grandmother. As a child, Porter was always reading, everything from classics to dime novels; his favorite works were Lane's translation of One Thousand and One Nights and Burton's The Anatomy of Melancholy.[2]

Porter graduated from his aunt Evelina Maria Porter's elementary school in 1876. He then enrolled at the Lindsey Street High School. His aunt continued to tutor him until he was 15. In 1879, he started working in his uncle's drugstore in Greensboro, and on August 30, 1881, at the age of 19, Porter was licensed as a pharmacist. At the drugstore, he also showed his natural artistic talents by sketching the townsfolk.

Life in Texas

Porter as a young man in Austin
Porter traveled along with James K. Hall to Texas in March 1882, hoping that a change of air would help alleviate a persistent cough he had developed. He took up residence on the sheep ranch of Richard Hall, James Hall's son, in La Salle County and helped out as a shepherd, ranch hand, cook, and baby-sitter. While on the ranch, he learned bits of Spanish and German from the mix of indigenous and immigrant ranch hands. He also spent time reading classic works of literature.

Porter's health did improve. He traveled with Richard to Austin, Texas, in 1884, where he decided to remain and was welcomed into the home of Richard's friends, Joseph Harrell, and his wife. Porter resided with the Harrells for three years. He went to work briefly for the Morley Brothers Drug Company as a pharmacist. Porter then moved on to work for the Harrell Cigar Store located in the Driskill Hotel. He also began writing as a sideline and wrote many of his early stories in the Harrell house.

As a young bachelor, Porter led an active social life in Austin. He was known for his wit, story-telling, and musical talents. He played both the guitar and mandolin. He sang in the choir at St. David's Episcopal Church and became a member of the ""Hill City Quartette"", a group of young men who sang at gatherings and serenaded young women of the town.


The Porter family, early 1890s ‚Äì Athol, daughter Margaret, William
Porter met and began courting Athol Estes, 17 years old and from a wealthy family. Historians believe Porter met Athol at the laying of the cornerstone of the Texas State Capitol on March 2, 1885. Her mother objected to the match because Athol was ill, suffering from tuberculosis. On July 1, 1887, Porter eloped with Athol and they were married in the parlor of the home of the Reverend R. K. Smoot, pastor of the Central Presbyterian Church, where the Estes family attended church. The couple continued to participate in musical and theater groups, and Athol encouraged her husband to pursue his writing. Athol gave birth to a son in 1888, who died hours after birth, and then a daughter Margaret Worth Porter in September 1889.

Porter's friend Richard Hall became Texas Land Commissioner and offered Porter a job. Porter started as a draftsman at the Texas General Land Office (GLO) on January 12, 1887, at a salary of $100 a month, drawing maps from surveys and field notes. The salary was enough to support his family, but he continued his contributions to magazines and newspapers. In the GLO building, he began developing characters and plots for such stories as ""Georgia's Ruling"" (1900), and ""Buried Treasure"" (1908). The castle-like building he worked in was woven into some of his tales such as ""Bexar Scrip No. 2692"" (1894). His job at the GLO was a political appointment by Hall. Hall ran for governor in the election of 1890 but lost. Porter resigned on January 21, 1891, the day after the new governor, Jim Hogg, was sworn in.


Porter as a clerk at the First National Bank in Austin, c.‚Äâ1892
The same year, Porter began working at the First National Bank of Austin as a teller and bookkeeper at the same salary he had made at the GLO. The bank was operated informally, and Porter was apparently careless in keeping his books and may have embezzled funds. In 1894, he was accused by the bank of embezzlement and lost his job but was not indicted at the time.

He then worked full-time on his humorous weekly called The Rolling Stone, which he started while working at the bank. The Rolling Stone featured satire on life, people, and politics and included Porter's short stories and sketches. Although eventually reaching a top circulation of 1,500, The Rolling Stone failed in April 1895 because the paper never provided an adequate income. However, his writing and drawings had caught the attention of the editor at the Houston Post.

Porter and his family moved to Houston in 1895, where he started writing for the Post. His salary was only $25 a month, but it rose steadily as his popularity increased. Porter gathered ideas for his column by loitering in hotel lobbies and observing and talking to people there. This was a technique he used throughout his writing career.

While he was in Houston, federal auditors audited the First National Bank of Austin and found the embezzlement shortages that led to his firing. A federal indictment followed, and he was arrested on charges of embezzlement.

Flight and return

Porter in his thirties
After his arrest, Porter's father-in-law posted his bail. He was due to stand trial on July 7, 1896, but the day before, as he was changing trains to get to the courthouse, he got scared. He fled, first to New Orleans and later to Honduras, with which the United States had no extradition treaty at that time. Porter lived in Honduras for six months, until January 1897. There he became friends with Al Jennings, a notorious train robber, who later wrote a book about their friendship.[3] He holed up in a Trujillo hotel, where he wrote Cabbages and Kings, which notably coined the term ""banana republic"".[4] Porter had sent Athol and Margaret back to Austin to live with Athol's parents. Unfortunately, Athol became too ill to meet Porter in Honduras as he had planned. When he learned that his wife was dying, Porter returned to Austin in February 1897 and surrendered to the court, pending trial. Athol Estes Porter died from tuberculosis (then known as consumption) on July 25, 1897.

Porter had little to say in his own defense at his trial and was found guilty on February 17, 1898, of embezzling $854.08. He was sentenced to five years in prison and imprisoned on March 25, 1898, at the Ohio Penitentiary in Columbus, Ohio. Porter was a licensed pharmacist and was able to work in the prison hospital as the night druggist. He was given his own room in the hospital wing, and there is no record that he actually spent time in the cell block of the prison. He had 14 stories published under various pseudonyms while he was in prison but was becoming best known as ""O. Henry"", a pseudonym that first appeared over the story ""Whistling Dick's Christmas Stocking"" in the December 1899 issue of McClure's Magazine. A friend of his in New Orleans would forward his stories to publishers so that they had no idea that the writer was imprisoned.

Porter was released on July 24, 1901, for good behavior after serving three years. He reunited with his daughter Margaret, now age 11, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where Athol's parents had moved after Porter's conviction.

Later life
Porter's most prolific writing period started in 1902, when he moved to New York City to be near his publishers. While there, he wrote 381 short stories. He wrote a story a week for over a year for the New York World Sunday Magazine. His wit, characterization, and plot twists were adored by his readers but often panned by critics.

Porter married again in 1907 to childhood sweetheart Sarah (Sallie) Lindsey Coleman, whom he met again after revisiting his native state of North Carolina. Coleman was herself a writer and wrote a romanticized and fictionalized version of their correspondence and courtship in her novella Wind of Destiny.[5]

Death
Porter was a heavy drinker, and by 1908, his markedly deteriorating health affected his writing. In 1909, Sarah left him, and he died on June 5, 1910, of cirrhosis of the liver, complications of diabetes, and an enlarged heart. According to one account, he died of cerebral hemorrhage.[6]

After funeral services in New York City, he was buried in the Riverside Cemetery in Asheville, North Carolina.[7] His daughter Margaret Worth Porter had a short writing career from 1913 to 1916. She married cartoonist Oscar Cesare of New York in 1916; they were divorced four years later. She died of tuberculosis in 1927 and was buried next to her father.

According to the cemetery, as of 2023, people have been leaving $1.87 in change (the amount of Della's savings at the beginning of ""The Gift of the Magi"") on Porter's grave for at least 30 years. The cemetery says the money is given to area libraries.[8]

Stories

Portrait used as frontispiece in Waifs and Strays (posthumous, 1917)
Most of Porter's stories are set in his own time, the early 20th century. He had an obvious affection for New York City, which he called ""Bagdad-on-the-Subway"",[9] and many of his stories are set there, while others are set in small towns or in other cities. They frequently feature working class characters, such as policemen and waitresses, as well as criminals and social outcasts. In his day he was called the American answer to French naturalist Guy de Maupassant, whose work was similarly concerned with the struggles of common people and often had twist endings.

Cabbages and Kings was his first collection of stories, followed by The Four Million. The second collection opens with a reference to Ward McAllister's claim that there were ""...only 'Four Hundred' people in New York City who were really worth noticing. But a wiser man has arisen‚Äîthe census taker‚Äîand his larger estimate of human interest has been preferred in marking out the field of these little stories of the Four Million.""

His final work was ""Dream"", a short story intended for the magazine The Cosmopolitan. It was never completed.[10]

Among his most famous stories are:

""The Gift of the Magi"" is about a young couple, Jim and Della, who are short of money but desperately want to buy each other Christmas gifts. Unbeknownst to Jim, Della sells her most valuable possession, her beautiful hair, in order to buy a platinum fob chain for Jim's watch; while unbeknownst to Della, Jim sells his own most valuable possession, his watch, to buy jeweled combs for Della's hair. The essential premise of this story has been copied, re-worked, parodied, and otherwise re-told countless times in the century since it was written.
""The Ransom of Red Chief"" in which two men kidnap a boy of ten years old to ransom him. The boy turns out to be so spoiled and obnoxious that the desperate men ultimately pay the boy's father $250 to take him back.
""The Cop and the Anthem"" about a New York City hobo named Soapy who sets out to get arrested so that he can be a guest of the city jail instead of sleeping out in the cold winter. Despite his best efforts at committing petty theft, vandalism, disorderly conduct, and ""flirting"" with a young prostitute, Soapy fails to draw the attention of the police. Dejected, he stops in front of a church, where an organ anthem inspires him to clean up his life; however, he is charged with loitering, and sentenced to three months in prison.
""A Retrieved Reformation"" tells the tale of safecracker Jimmy Valentine, a man recently freed from prison. He goes to a town bank to case it before he robs it. As he walks to the door, he catches the eye of the banker's beautiful daughter. They immediately fall in love and Valentine decides to give up his criminal career. He moves into the town, taking up the identity of Ralph Spencer, a shoemaker. Just as he is about to leave to deliver his specialized tools to an old associate, a lawman who recognizes him arrives at the bank. Jimmy and his fianc√©e and her family are at the bank, inspecting a new safe when a child accidentally gets locked inside the airtight vault. Knowing it will seal his fate, Valentine opens the safe to rescue the child. However, much to Valentine's surprise, the lawman denies recognizing him and lets him go.
""The Duplicity of Hargraves"" tells the story of the Talbots, a father and daughter from the Old South, newly poor after the Civil War, who move to Washington, DC. An actor, Hargraves, offers Mr. Talbot money, which he is too proud to accept. But when Talbot is approached by an old man, a former slave who gives him money to settle an old family debt, he accepts it. It is later revealed that Hargraves secretly portrayed the slave.
""The Caballero's Way"" in which Porter's most famous character, the Cisco Kid, is introduced. It was first published in 1907 in the July issue of Everybody's Magazine and collected in the book Heart of the West that same year. In later film and TV depictions, the Kid would be portrayed as a dashing adventurer, perhaps skirting the edges of the law, but primarily on the side of the angels. In the original short story, the only story by Porter to feature the character, the Kid is a murderous, ruthless border desperado, whose trail is dogged by a heroic Texas Ranger.
Pen name
Porter used a number of pen names (including ""O. Henry"" or ""Olivier Henry"") in the early part of his writing career; other names included S.H. Peters, James L. Bliss, T.B. Dowd, and Howard Clark.[11] Nevertheless, the name ""O. Henry"" seemed to garner the most attention from editors and the public, and was used exclusively by Porter for his writing by about 1902. He gave various explanations for the origin of his pen name.[12] In 1909, he gave an interview to The New York Times, in which he gave an account of it:

It was during these New Orleans days that I adopted my pen name of O. Henry. I said to a friend: ""I'm going to send out some stuff. I don't know if it amounts to much, so I want to get a literary alias. Help me pick out a good one."" He suggested that we get a newspaper and pick a name from the first list of notables that we found in it. In the society columns we found the account of a fashionable ball. ""Here we have our notables,"" said he. We looked down the list and my eye lighted on the name Henry, ""That'll do for a last name,"" said I. ""Now for a first name. I want something short. None of your three-syllable names for me."" ""Why don't you use a plain initial letter, then?"" asked my friend. ""Good,"" said I, ""O is about the easiest letter written, and O it is.""

A newspaper once wrote and asked me what the O stands for. I replied, ""O stands for Olivier, the French for Oliver."" And several of my stories accordingly appeared in that paper under the name Olivier Henry.[13]

William Trevor writes in the introduction to The World of O. Henry: Roads of Destiny and Other Stories (Hodder & Stoughton, 1973) that ""there was a prison guard named Orrin Henry"" in the Ohio State Penitentiary ""whom William Sydney Porter ... immortalised as O. Henry"".

According to J. F. Clarke, it is from the name of the French pharmacist Etienne Ossian Henry, whose name is in the U.S. Dispensary which Porter used working in the prison pharmacy.[14]

Writer and scholar Guy Davenport offers his own hypothesis: ""The pseudonym that he began to write under in prison is constructed from the first two letters of Ohio and the second and last two of penitentiary.""[12]

Legacy
The O. Henry Award is an annual prize named after Porter and given to outstanding short stories.

A film was made in 1952 featuring five stories, called O. Henry's Full House. The episode garnering the most critical acclaim[15] was ""The Cop and the Anthem"" starring Charles Laughton and Marilyn Monroe. The other stories are ""The Clarion Call"", ""The Last Leaf"", ""The Ransom of Red Chief"", and ""The Gift of the Magi"".

Strictly Business is a 1962 Soviet comedy film, directed by Leonid Gaidai, based on three short stories by O. Henry: ""The Roads We Take"", ""Makes the Whole World Kin"", and ""The Ransom of Red Chief"". The premiere of the film was timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of the writer. Henry was particularly popular in Russia in the 1920s, and was described by the critic Deming Brown in 1953 as ""remain[ing] a minor classic in Russia"".[16] In 1962, the Soviet Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating O. Henry's 100th birthday.

A 1957 television series, The O. Henry Playhouse, was syndicated in 39 episodes to 188 markets.[17] Actor Thomas Mitchell portrayed O. Henry in each episode as he interacted with his characters or related his latest story to his publisher or a friend.[18]

The 1986 Indian anthology television series Katha Sagar adapted several of Henry's short stories as episodes including ""The Last Leaf"".

An opera in one long act, The Furnished Room, with music by Daniel Steven Crafts and libretto by Richard Kuss, is based on O. Henry's story of the same name.

The O. Henry House and O. Henry Hall, both in Austin, Texas, are named for him. O. Henry Hall, now owned by the Texas State University System, previously served as the federal courthouse in which O. Henry was convicted of embezzlement. The O. Henry House has been the site of the O. Henry Pun-Off, an annual spoken word competition inspired by Porter's love of language, since 1978. (Dr. Samuel E. Gideon, a historical architect and professor at the University of Texas at Austin, was a strong advocate for the saving of the O. Henry House in Austin.)

Several schools are named for Porter: William Sydney Porter Elementary in Greensboro, North Carolina,[19] O. Henry Elementary in Garland, Texas, the O. Henry School (I.S. 70) in New York City,[20] and O. Henry Middle School in Austin, Texas.[21]

The O. Henry Hotel in Greensboro is also named for Porter, as is US 29, which is O. Henry Boulevard.

Asheville, North Carolina, where Porter is buried, has O. Henry Avenue, the location of the Asheville Citizen-Times building.[22]

On September 11, 2012, the United States Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating the 150th anniversary of O. Henry's birth.[23]

On November 23, 2011, Barack Obama quoted O. Henry while granting pardons to two turkeys named ""Liberty"" and ""Peace"".[24] In response, political science professor P. S. Ruckman Jr. and Texas attorney Scott Henson filed a formal application for a posthumous pardon in September 2012, the same month that the U.S. Postal Service issued its O. Henry stamp.[25] Previous attempts were made to obtain such a pardon for Porter in the administrations of Woodrow Wilson, Dwight Eisenhower, and Ronald Reagan,[26] but no one had ever bothered to file a formal application.[27] Ruckman and Henson argued that Porter deserved a pardon because (1) he was a law-abiding citizen prior to his conviction; (2) his offense was minor; (3) he had an exemplary prison record; (4) his post-prison life clearly indicated rehabilitation; (5) he would have been an excellent candidate for clemency in his time, had he but applied for pardon; (6) by today's standards, he remains an excellent candidate for clemency; and (7) his pardon would be a well-deserved symbolic gesture and more.[25] The pardon remains ungranted.

In 2021 the Library of America included O. Henry in their list by publishing a collection of 101 of his stories, edited by Ben Yagoda.[28]

Mayne_Reid,"Thomas Mayne Reid (4 April 1818 ‚Äì 22 October 1883) was an Irish British novelist who fought in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846‚Äì1848). His many works on American life describe colonial policy in the American colonies, the horrors of slave labour, and the lives of American Indians. ""Captain"" Reid wrote adventure novels akin to those by Frederick Marryat (1792-1848), and Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894). They were set mainly in the American West, Mexico, South Africa, the Himalayas, and Jamaica. He was an admirer of Lord Byron. His novel Quadroon (1856), an anti-slavery work, was later adapted as a play entitled The Octoroon (1859) by Dion Boucicault and produced in New York.

While Reid's novels have become almost completely forgotten in the Anglosphere, they have remained popular in Eastern Europe and particularly in Russia (ever since the Czar of Russia / House of Romanov imperial dynasty of the Russian Empire), being considered a part of the canon of Western literature and being published under the category of ""World Classics"" along with Jack London and James Fenimore Cooper.[1]

Biography
Early years
Reid was born in Ballyroney, a hamlet near Katesbridge, County Down, in present-day Northern Ireland, the son of Rev. Thomas Mayne Reid Sr., a senior clerk of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, and his wife. His father wanted Reid to become a Presbyterian minister, and in September 1834 the youth enrolled at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution. He stayed for four years, but lacked motivation to complete his studies and graduate. He headed back to Ballyroney to teach at a school.

In December 1839 Reid boarded the Dumfriesshire, bound for New Orleans, Louisiana, arriving in January 1840. He soon found a job as a corn factor's clerk in the corn market. After six months in New Orleans, he is said to have left for refusing to whip slaves. Reid later used Louisiana as the setting of one of his successful books, an anti-slavery novel entitled The Quadroon (1856).

Reid travelled to Tennessee, where on a plantation near Nashville he tutored the children of Dr. Peyton Robertson. Some twenty years later, Reid would make mid-Tennessee the setting for his novel The Wild Huntress. After Robertson's death, Reid founded a short-lived school in Nashville.

In 1841 he found work as a clerk for a provision dealer in either Natchez, Mississippi, or Natchitoches, Louisiana (the latter seems likelier). Although Reid later claimed to have made several trips West in this period, on which he purportedly based some of his novels, the evidence for this is sketchy and confusing at best.

Literary career
In late 1842 Reid arrived in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he began writing prose and poetry for the Pittsburgh Morning Chronicle under a pen-name, the Poor Scholar. He also apparently worked as a carrier for the paper. His earliest verifiable work is a series of epic poems called Scenes in the West Indies.

In early 1843, Reid moved to Philadelphia for three years, working as a journalist and periodically publishing poetry in Godey's Lady's Book, Graham's Magazine, the Ladies National Magazine and elsewhere, still using his Pittsburgh pseudonym. There he met Edgar Allan Poe, who became a drinking companion for a time.[2] Poe would later call Reid ""a colossal but most picturesque liar. He fibs on a surprising scale but with the finish of an artist, and that is why I listen to him attentively.""[3]

When the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War began in the spring of 1846, Reid worked as a correspondent for the New York Herald in Newport, Rhode Island. He set one of his novels here. At this time, he added the pen-name Ecolier to the Poor Scholar.

On 23 November 1846, Reid joined the First New York Volunteer Infantry as a second lieutenant, leaving by ship with the regiment in January 1847. They camped for several weeks at Lobos Island before joining Major General Winfield Scott's invasion of Central Mexico, which began on 9 March at Vera Cruz. Reid as Ecolier was a correspondent for a New York paper, Spirit of the Times, which published his Sketches by a Skirmisher. On 13 September, at the Battle of Chapultepec, Reid received a severe thigh wound while leading a charge. He was afterward promoted to first lieutenant for bravery in battle. On 5 May 1848 he resigned his commission and in July returned to New York with his regiment.

Love's Martyr, Reid's first play, was staged at the Walnut Street Theater, Philadelphia, for five nights in October 1848. He published War Life, an account of his army service, on 27 June 1849.

Learning of the Bavarian Revolution, Reid headed for England to volunteer, but after the Atlantic crossing changed his mind and went home to Ireland instead.

He soon moved to London and in 1850 published his first novel, The Rifle Rangers. This was followed by The Scalp Hunters (1851; dedicated to Commodore Edwin W. Moore, whom he met in 1841), The Desert Home (1852), and The Boy Hunters (1853). The last, set in Texas and Louisiana, was a ""juvenile scientific travelogue"" that become a favourite with young Theodore Roosevelt, who became a Reid fan. That year Reid married 15-year-old Elizabeth Hyde, daughter of his publisher, G. W. Hyde, an English aristocrat and his wife.

After time off with his new bride, Reid returned to writing. He continued to base his novels on his adventures in America. Several more were successful: The White Chief (1855), The Quadroon (1856), Osceola (1858) and The Headless Horseman (1865). He spent money freely, including building in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, a sprawling ""Rancho"", a reproduction of a Mexican hacienda he had seen during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, where he took to farming. This extravagance led to bankruptcy in November 1866, from which he was discharged in January 1867. That October he left London for Newport, Rhode Island, hoping to repeat his past success in the U.S.. He returned to New York in 1867 and founded the Onward Magazine there.[4]

Last years
Reid lectured at Steinway Hall in New York and published the novel The Helpless Hand in 1868, but his popularity had declined in America. His wound from Chapultepec started to bother him and he was hospitalized for several months at St Luke Hospital in 1870. His wife hated the United States. After he was released from the hospital, they returned to England on 22 October 1870, to live at Ross on Wye, Herefordshire.

In England, Reid continued to write stories and reworked some earlier novels. ""The Death Shot"" was published in the Penny Illustrated Paper. In October 1874, an abscess formed on the knee of his wounded leg, leaving him unable to walk without crutches. He was joint editor with John Latey of The Boys' Illustrated News for ten months from 6 April 1881. He wrote and published in it ""The Lost Mountain; a Tale of Sonora.""

About this time Reid's creative energy began to flag and he lost popularity, so he turned to farming near Ross in Herefordshire. He continued to write. His last novel, No Quarter, set in the Parliamentary wars, and his last boys' book, The Land of Fire, were published after his death on 22 October 1883.[5] He was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, now part of London. His tombstone quotes from The Scalp Hunters: ""This is 'weed prairie'; it is misnamed: It is the Garden of God.""[6]

Influence and legacy

Capt. Mayne Reid, from an oil portrait, circa 1863
Books such as the Young Voyagers were highly popular, especially with boys. His tales of the American West were also popular with children across Europe and Russia. Many became popular in Polish or Russian translations, including The Rifle Rangers (1850), Scalp Hunters (1851), Boy Hunters (1853), War Trail (1851), Boy Tar (1859), and Headless Horseman (1865/6).[4] Several Russian and Polish writers have noted the influence of his works in their childhoods.

For instance, Vladimir Nabokov recalled The Headless Horseman as a favourite adventure novel of his boyhood ‚Äì ""which had given him a vision of the prairies and the great open spaces and the overarching sky.""[7] At age 11, Nabokov translated The Headless Horseman into French alexandrines.[8] Alexander Bek mentions the well-read K. K. Rokossovsky, future Marshal of the Soviet Union, referring to Reid's work in early 1942.[9] The Polish writer Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz cites Russian translations of Reid as well-remembered early reading matter, by which he also learned Russian and the Cyrillic alphabet. A chapter on Reid appears in his essay collection Emperor of the Earth (1976). Anton Chekhov in Island, a Journey to Sakhalin (1893‚Äì94) mentions ""Mayne Reid"" in Chapter 10: ""The morose, angry sea has spread itself boundlessly for thousands of versts. When a little boy has been reading Mayne Reid and his blanket falls off during the night, he starts shivering, and it is then that he dreams of such a sea.""

United States President Theodore Roosevelt, in his autobiography, credits Reid with being a major early inspiration. The shy, asthmatic upper-class boy, Teddy Roosevelt, grew up to pursue naturalistic zoology and adventure travel. Russell Miller, in his biography of Arthur Conan Doyle, credits Reid as one of the writer's favourite childhood authors and a great influence on his writings.

While almost completely forgotten in the Western world, Reid's novels are popular in Russia and Eastern Europe, being considered a part of Western literature canon and published under the category of ""World Classics"" (along with Jack London and Fenimore Cooper).[1]

Although Reid called himself and is listed often as Captain, Francis B. Heitman's definitive Historical Register and Dictionary of the U.S. Army shows he only reached the rank of lieutenant.
